That is what will happen? CSSD does not know or voldemort cake in Prague.
The CSSD newly elected to the mayoralty of the capital will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand the level of municipal council with their old and new collegues of ODS.
The daily actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the Municipal Council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argôt who was born during the dernieres city, when they were partners in the current coalition headed to Prague.
The coded language, that the cream of Prague policy initiated during the previous era of Mayor Pavel BEM described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
I was surprised that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not include trés well known terms.
Or so they say.
"which is valdemort".
"I really do not know".
"I am a jeunôt in politics pragoise reacted Lukas kaucky, elected to culture in the test of the vocabulary of" the godfather ".
And as regards the veteran politician, the elected Karel brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "hole in golf".
"This is the only expression among those that you are proposing that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
The vocabulary, the daily aktualne.cz Published expressions in June of this year before the Congrés pré-éĺectoral of ODS, the editor has chosen 6 examples, particularly those associated with the Mayor of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of “voldemort, '" the greatest golf hole in Prague, "go to the Patisserie nerve", "probable", "betrayal of the capital" and "entôler".
Three of the elected members were in agreement on the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - has promised to begin an interview but then has not got the phone.
The fifth elected Petr dolinek has flatly refused the test.
"I am not looking at all these things, and how people are amused, representatives of democratic citizenship: I will not give my opinion."
"I am in the process of how we understand in the framework of our programmes, we have reacted.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas kaucky apparently would not recognize in the text above, that it is the influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the link Roman BEM.
"voldemort" says nothing á' kaucky and the only words he had guessed at the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague".
"It is the tunnel," said blanka kaucky immediately and adds: "but I know newspapers".
"I will have to pay a language course", pleasant t it.
Not only the Matador Karel brezina but Lukas plachy, elected for the environment, know that the hole in golf is the blanko tunnel.
The two Democrats know that is really voldemort and Lukas plachy knows where to find the man - he believes in the sense of "go to cake".
"It is, I think, to move in a company," plachy is willing to guess that it is the headquarters of companies of Janousek.
In the same tone brezina recalls that it derives its knowledge rather newspapers and not of any language that he would use.
According to the candidates to testing there is no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
"I have taken advice with colleagues and it seems that we do not really something of this kind".
"It was rather the names some time Use of abbreviations and symbols," said Peter hlinsky, Chairman of the Democratic Party, that party members call hulda.
"I called Briza at school but I do not know if my colleagues call it, admit Karel brezina of nicknames.
The daily actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Papy Weinert is for members of the party or the least friendly little old, the Representative Miroslav pocket, which drew attention to him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the small toy".
The latter are also the only admit that work within the party, the Social Democrats.
It seems that hulinsky do not like hearing a lot, but the daily hulda akutel.cz recorded another nickname Prague to this President.
"JD" recalls truncheons appears that Petr hulinsky earned his Doctorate in Law judr.à the Police Academy in Bratislava.
The Government wants to reduce the torture "witches", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, the women reported witches have common features.
They are part of the old generation, may not work, for example, for reasons of health, are free and have no children.
That becomes "witch" is isolated in order not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely This destiny".
"There is no more young women in good health as they participate in the work and the birth of children," said sister, who is in the capital of the West African countries, Burkina Faso, in a special institution for more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local Government decided to speak against this "social measure" unusual.
He edited a booklet which should help a limit the witch-hunt.
The case involves a "snag".
"more than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the newspaper Die standard with regard to the problem of education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbour of Burkina Faso, ammy hemma, a woman of 72 years died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil they had sprayed.
This is the domain of the BBC which transmitted this information.
The criminals claim that it was the evil eye.
According to their version of the oil that is used for ritual onctions emflammée is in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, apparently, when the team wanted to "chase the bad spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of "witches" was approved by the people of all levels of education.
The daily der standard quoted a 42-year old Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human minds have always represented a danger," said he.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia no later than last year has even seen the President himself participate.
"The Gambian President dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch-hunt that apparently were involved in his death and are tried by the black magic to kill the President."
"The shamans of Guinea close to come to the rescue, have led to the strong presidential kanilai, under the protection of police and the President's personal guard, men and women selected at random dansdes villages of Gambia," said in a message to the Organization "Amnesty International.
The firm has imprisoned persons to drink herbal potion to hallucinogenic effects which resulted in most other effects on the kidneys and the intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
On the international pressure that is about one thousand people who were released.
The tenant of bakal poèles: The heat, he signed a higher rent.
An elderly man that came through the door of the centre clientele of society RPG byty "Coal Baron" Zdenek bakal, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He wore under his arm a dossier with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is now serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to the three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 son will pay starting next year for an apartment 2 + 1 second class 4100 crowns.
"and there was no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract for his son, who has the power of a signature.
"But I signed when even" explains t he motié angry and resigned.
The civic association bytyokd.cz apartments, which described the nouelles rental conditions as "immoral and obscene," advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when be issued a notice to explain the methodology for the claim.
But the man reacts to it by a gesture of the hand.
"One said this, another said something else" the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the new year, it expects most of the apartment in the Czech Republic where rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for that reason decided to visit the "Laboratory".
The waiting room of GPR havirovska street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 o'clock in the morning.
Just outside the door stands a custody of a security company with an instrument to draw customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is displayed on the screen tactile.
One pressure and a piece of paper with a lot of the apparatus.
You do not have the time to read your number "157" that your number is already beginning to illuminate on the big screen in the topit to the waiting room.
In a split second it is your turn.
After a short time, an elderly couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not appear to involve people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to resolve common problems like everywhere - request repairs, events relating to insurance and others.
In Ostrava, people more 44000 apartments of the portfolio of GPR couriers benefit with the new leases in their letter box since around mid-November.
GPR byty their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 per cent.
The special window for the new rent is open to the public since 18 November.
"It works for nearly a week, it is still being tested," said, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client is present as a journalist.
The déragulation and old age of bakal flats are a very sensitive area.
The Vice-President of Parliament and come from the region of Ostrava Lubomir zaoralek of democrats in a State so sustained enough before the elections, and this is now the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor".
"They do not even have changed a... N could go in the toilet, relieves mentioned in the Introduction.
However, it is mainly, according to employees, pensioners who have to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new rent if they sign up to now as promised RPG in a special offers.
It is a rebate of half the amount of rent that will receive other loctaires who have signed a new contract before 15 December.
But the "window" deregulation of the street havirovaska really is not burdened by the questions.
"among the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," said an employee at the ticket office.
And yet RPG porpose both on its web site that in the windows of individual interviews on rents when it is needed.
If the two sides do not agree on the rent that is an independent court, which will take the decision.
It is not only threats, but to inform on the sole and legitimate way to act legally, "said GPR on its web site.
"now no one will go to court," said one female RPG byty and the man in the street in the centre of clients give him reason.
"I 13000 kroons of retirement and it remains 5000 kroons to eat, I do not have enough to go to court," said he.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will see".
"Mr. zaoralek in the media ask that nobody signs and therefore the people expect," said t it.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011, and the increases, according to RPG byty, is an economic necessity.
"and the current rents do not always reach the level required to maintain the Fund for Housing," said Pavel klimes, Director of residential portfolio byty RPG society, that it is precisely the negligence of the Fund for Housing, which makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in rental apartments, 4 billion in four years from 2011 a 2014 should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hung from the ceiling in the face of cushioned chairs in the waiting room of the street havirosvka, repeat some information marked in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and not least 31200 apartments is more than 90 percent of the apartments of GPR."
"and this will always be the most 7.50 koruny the m ² per month," said the screen.
The increase of 38 per cent concerned only 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases, there is an increase of a very low CZK 19.66 at m ²," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
GPR byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical increase gradual but on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money to rent increases (see chart) is made for apartments in the form of savings in heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign up to the Agreement on the increase of rents have priority.
Kindergarten is part, too, have understood the architects.
The administrative building avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the arch design.
Nobody would have expected that also houses a mini nursery school with everything it needs — the walls of imaginative colours, furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, can make children of employees of arch. design.
The society of projets-architectonique design. arch. The workshops had produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined his mini Nursery School of Business since the first drafts of the building avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, mainly of the age to have children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time as labour contracts in time decreased, nursery school is a proposed bonuses to its employees by society design. arch. In the framework of the social agenda.
Builders and architects have the possibility to combine a job taking with the care for children.
It is the employees of arch.design.eux-mêmes have imagined this nursery school and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational programme for human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the availability of funding (2.8 mil.de Koruny). They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years for qualified personnel as well as the road.
After the use of funding (two years), the company arch. Design. obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is the economy rating that has helped to make the request.
The care for children is provided by qualified staff, all day, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher in enfants. children can go to school, without age restrictions but they have more than three years.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day, there are more who will replace.
The functioning of the school is flexible, depending on the needs of parents and children of all employees have the right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although agise an individual care and education, the programme of the mini nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children are no that play but a quality education is also guaranteed – from the beginning until the preparation for school benches teaches English.
The class is equipped not only to toys and games imaginative but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive.
Parents may at any time verify their child and not having the stress of a delay to collect the children in a school near the place of work of parents.
Parents use their time more productively.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.design.s' is included among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruitment of new employees and that are friendly towards the family and through this programme enhances the marketing of RH.
The House still fascinates bones after 100 years. Take a look in the English of Gaudi.
The toît looks like the back of a prehistoric saurien, the staircase to a backbone of dinosaur and balconies to fish gueules open.
It is thus the House Casa battlo Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi's.
Because of its Organic forms, the House has received from the local nickname into bone.
Organic forms, colors, unusual use wild, fragments of stone tiles and mosaîque, facade Recalling flakes curves and present everywhere, this is everything ypique for the new art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the House conducted its lines of dream, its colours and textures visually reminiscent of nature and animals.
In a more detailed comment is the geometry, the pace and thought with precision.
On the night the facade of the House becomes even more dramatic and activated the impression of glitter colours is strengthened.
The winding and twisting forms also appears in the English with the same measure.
Timber copy in vague bundles of windows, the decorative balustrades, the doors, the oeilleton and strips.
The House battlo which runs in the eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia merchant street at number 43, is born of the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction is made for two years and the House completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, was first placed on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of unusual Gaudi reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa battlo as house in multiple housing was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that are born the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and use the mosaîque window-dressing.
For the facade also worked for other artists and creators.
The joint work plans for the House, Casa battlo began by cooperation between succés jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in building the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and guell park where there are other works of Gaudi.
Locals have nicknamed the hot House just after its completion because of its Organic forms' home in bones ".
Further, with regard to the specific mechanism of opening windows have called "the House baille".
It said that the building there is a sword similar to that of St George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of construction contain religious motives hidden.
Gaudi was thought to house a single system in his time with central heating, ventilating vents and chimneys characteristic.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the establishment Gaudi has not followed the guidelines of construction and has not left stand by them.
At the beginning of construction he obtained from the city the permits, knowing of course that the data entered on reconstruction plans were so vague that during the two years after finishing the City Council was horrified and demanded changes.
He did not like, for example, members of the City Council that the pillars of the construction empiettent public on the sidewalk.
There were ever to change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city Josep battlo demanded (and got satisfaction) permission to rent the top two floors.
The owner déménagea to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor, there was a common Lounge and the third a Chamber and a closed part of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The full house of six floors is shared by a staircase by which access up to a balcony of toît independent.
All angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by walls curves.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of the spaces.
The municipality may be connected completely by opening the doors of the exhibition and the high society can communicate comfortably or confined space for private interviews, more intimate.
The House with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received a new facades toîture non-traditional and two floors apart.
The game of Gaudi with the light is also impressive, of blue and white glazed tile, which is decorated with the domestic court and sinks of enlightenment.
The stake in two colours give a maximum of light across the floors of the House.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflête more than the bleak instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The House Casa battlo which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage may be visited by each.
The first floor of the apartment house is the largest and most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners have decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they have found it is a lucrative business and they have broadened the scope of visits to the common spaces and the attic including toît terraces.
The entry ticket to the monument is not really expensive and cost €16.50; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20 per cent discounts.
The sum is still above the price of entry into the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the atmosphere of the House with its fantastic shock struts, you quickly find a comrade among residents of the building completely and visit the House.
How to choose a mattress and a sommier: women have other criteria as men.
Not ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of the surface for the bed, so the mattress and sommier provide a real basis for a good read.
Of course they should harmoniously complement each other to please a user concrete.
During the selection of several things are essential: the weight, size, age, state of health, and the sex of the owner.
The type of procedure in which it will place the mattress and sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the cottage where it never sleeps continually latex mattresses are not appropriate because they are "warm" slowly.
They also have a higher weight to mattresses in standard polyurethane.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they are, in addition, on a solid, they hold moisture. The mould may also be formed.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
That is the clear time abroad where it often uses mattresses very thick with a layer rammollissante, feels ill on a surface low and hard.
"This is so that all hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there".
"for their shoulders tired, legs and ribs, they needed mattress with a layer of foam rammollisante lazy".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes, who have a disorder of the nervous system that is failing" information "of the joints and the skin," explained adamczikova Sylva, who specializes in the upholstered furniture.
It is for this reason that a few years ago the mattress with foam lazy won the hokeyistes so that other customers.
"Today everything went well, tempur, Italian magnifex but Czech growers, for example appropriate mattresses.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to assess a foam lazy.
This "miracle" is simply.
She optimalise its rigidity and his form in the heat absorbed or adapts to the warmth of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you do not go back into the night as after a difficult match.
You simply dormez better.
The foam lazy also functions as a protection against esquarres.
For the choice of mattresses, depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman from a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210 / 220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm is 180 cm.
For beds in one place, the singles, for example, it is recommended to be at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is easy to visit.
"However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on its back, you should ask the hands so comfortable with the elbows slightly folded. Helena prokopova, President of the Association of bourreliers-matelassiers decorators and focused for several years on the issue of a healthy sleep and ergonomic furniture and taught in the schools.
For a bed for two everyone needs its own sommier and mattresses, therefore, attention during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will to mount the sommier at different heights and that is not achievable in all settings.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, mattresses to springs at least 15 cm, this count for the layer of form and venting at least three centimetres.
"The touch or while seated on the mattress you must not feel springs," warns Héléna prokopova.
Each mattress request a specific type of sommier.
The lit-sommier, when the mattress and sommier are together as sisters siamoises, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattress is aèrent badly; we must not wash, which is commonly auhourd' today.
And as for the night is normally very 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress starts to recall a great (and sieve filled).
For this the specialists refuse to make the claims on a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee for life.
But its but.
And that a Council of experience on the part of sellers: for a mattress of 120 / 140cm, dispensing, to the surface of the mattress, hygiene and cleaning but rather Jolly mattress of protection that vouspouvez easily withdraw and washing.
And even if these days it is common for manufacturing of coatings with closure to slide for the whole, that is to say that after the opening it was two parts (for washing and the size of a washing machine that is very important!) if not manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when cut a battle between a light weight and a lorry on a ring.
You have in your bed a rigid wall instead of a sommier?
Never!
The maximum for a bed for the visitors for a single night.
However équipez do (if there are not) ventilation holes and use the mattress to springs with a minimum height of 70 cm with springs in sachets taschenfederken (Germany) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For the beams to strips to unique position with 14 / 18 strips, the so-called latex mattresses or sandwich (perhaps the combination of rubber and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more strips, 28 and above, where the strips are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys, and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress at several positions it must not take mattresses to springs because it does not respond to changes in position.
Besides setting the rigidity of the strips can install also known as a cradle of shoulder.
It is a special link strips that can push even tilt the gills are allowed for the shoulder of dormeur "fits well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back ', it really is an important issue.
This thing is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattresses that for "masculine" began to use a rammollissante zone at the shoulders.
But they also believe the women - they offer a more sluggish surface at the hips.
For the customer, the more difficult the beams to wings or pamphlets with so-called multiforce suspension.
The pressure is given in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, when you use a pillow (large and inflated) on good mattresses and sommier, the "more" disparait.
The basic rule is a pillow quite simple: the pillow should support the head and its spines should meet only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50x60 cm as the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When one is lying on its side, the pillow must upgrade (with the cradle of the shoulder sommier rammollie or zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural substances or mixtures.
The trend is also on mattresses bio.
The raw materials of pétrôle, from which it produces PUR, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use precisely the soya.
"the word bio for the mattress means that the heart is manufactured from natural products," said Petr vasicek growers society.
The natural materials are used also for coatings mattresses; one of the first was the Aloe Vera.
But you can add micro-capsules of perfumes in the forest or lavande.
There are differences between men and women.
While the birch extracted from plants on the surface of the mattress absorbs heat and cool down the body, "cool," the "heat" women.
The excerpt of red pepper, boosts blood circulation and is therefore hotter for the weaker sex.
The current favourite?
The mattress made from foam cold (it has more pores with a cellular disrupted more than the standard polyurethane respirante and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidity of cold call foam mattresses polyzones who know exactly where is the head, the lower back and feet.
You pay a mattress of quality from 7000 kronor and more.
Those who are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are used as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is gumotex who has reached the top.
Save for the mattress and sommier is not simple.
We may from time to time in the framework of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the company offering magniflex mattresses duofreeze with the memory foam memory sewn onto the surface for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free of charge.
The era of foam lazy or cellular viscoélastiques with an open and great thickness was begun with the tempur material to a cosmic "pace".
It started as a substance for NASA parceque astronauts suffered at the start of a huge load factors.
The tempur is rammollit heat and hardens, instead, to the cold.
It is therefore perfectly to the human body and to distribute hot optimum pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil and slept for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Mosses viscoélastiques are used not only for the mattress, but also for products for health, such as the special airbags for the feet, which relieves the legs and the system veineux.
The Czech manufacturers use, for example, the foam eucathermc or twinsaver or of the same type.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly requested by parents who wish to keep their children.
The fear for their child brings more people to think about the monitor through a GPS.
The system, introduced at the beginning to search cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases such as that of the small exmple anicka janatkova.
The instrument is also a big box of matches but will soon be the size of a clock.
The case of the small anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to say at all that he is not a spy but just another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," said Petr pilin of society macro Weil, who is one of the providers of tracking devices on the market.
"I confess that there may be cases of misuse of such appliances, such as, for example, put it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met with such cases".
"The majority of people are really clients who purchase the product for security reasons, adds pilin.
According to him, the children should always know what is used "the box" and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana bockova, drew attention if the child does not want to be on to something, he débarassera.
"and even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they do not want to be under control".
"The phones, which can come off as these devices tracing, have already prompted parents to long delays," says bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of aircraft can assist in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If a kidnapping prepared, he will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device that can locate".
"currently, it is the telephone".
"as soon as that will develop the tracking devices, they (criminals) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by a publicity campaign".
"In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She admits that such equipment can help during an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert cech of society RC monitoring, which is tracing services both for cars and people, says that for this type of aircraft can help, even if it was destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The aircraft can be fine-tuned so that it is in regular programme after a period".
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it is just the latest position of the person concerned ”.
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer to report immediately to the position of the person who has slipped and is reflected in the elongated position without moving," said cech.
According to him, the so-called smart phones, which are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a similar service after formatting with a special prologiciel.
The problem of tracing systems at present is that it is either a device similar to those that it deals in pendentif the size of a box of matches is the smallest telephones.
We can always lose.
According to pilina of society macro Weil, that is why the tests are being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible aggressor may not recognize the tracing system".
"or it will show after a certain time, which would have given the police a little more time," he adds.
That the tracing system to be developed in the form of bracelet or utilisiera pendentif, always the same technology that for cars.
It is a combination of systems for the acquisition of a position via GPS (which is currently used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone service that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has a detonating cords that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with. But it can take two years.
The army has bought for 445 km of cordeaux used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army has therefore reserves to 225 years.
The problem is that the life of cordeaux is two to four years.
The army has bought detonating cords to the limited company STV group for 40 million kroons.
The general staff as a reason for the achât a huge amount of detonating cords at MF dnes that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of reservation to detain pyrotechniciens facts by the army, that MF dnes contacted, it appears that even the generals, officers having a command, Secretaries or household staff should have an annual exercise to explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Defence Minister vlastimil picek and, Commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cord.
This distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army could provide for 10 years.
If it is true that for the basic form of each new professionals it suffices to more than 2m of detonating cord, according to the experts, this means that the army with its new purchase assured - also with the use of special units and engineering - reservations for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Quick Reaction Brigade have recently complained to the Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that meetings of TIR are limited because of the need for money.
Regarding the lack of body linen, it does not mention them.
"and I do not take the lead if they buy a great quantity of detonating cord".
"and it is their decision, and they really know what they are doing".
"For us the army is a good customer that we seek as traders of content," said the commercial Director of STV Group Jan decky.
Jan pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argued the achât of hundreds of kilometres of detonating cords by the fact that the army will take these "ammunition" for 10 years.
Jan decky of STV group reported, however, only four years of life of pyrotechniciens detonating cord and the police and the army in only two years.
"if they are stored in deposits, it may even go up to four years," said one, who did not want his name published in connection with the criticism of the army.
The period of duration of living past, each munition should be tested to see whether she is honest and is not a threat to the life of a soldier.
These tests, however, are not free of charge and cost money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a discount to the amount for 445 km of detonating cordeux.
"They have lost 60 per cent less than the provision for the past year of 245 km," said the spokesman pejsek which is emblematic of the view of buyers from the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechniciens that circumvents the ammunition from the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police is still only the necessary quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
It has been prepared for security reasons of pyrotechniciens, in order to obtain a more flexible types of detonating cords, more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence now has big problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men prepared to move, cap on the Rhine.
What awaits them in a few years the Czech Army that MF dnes contacted: disable hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords that she now buys "cheap".
Until today, I benefit from contacts that I have achieved through competition.
The sale of her hotel franchise has helped Lukas pytloun for the winner of the competition for the best individual contractor.
The winner of the competition for the best individual contractor for the past year has been Lukas pytloun, contractor for 28 years.
His adventure to the succés is like in a movie.
Lukas pytloun loved travel.
And abroad, it was reported that it lacked a libérec accommodation site of quality at a reasonable price.
Its savings on what he had won when he worked abroad and with the assistance of a bank loan it has bought a small building 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in trosième year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of a shelter in our region gave me want to do something," said Lucas pytloun.
He started a rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the benefit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, the action of contractor allowed him to open at libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants in style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds in all categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars pytloun design Hotel.
This year it came another of equal quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in ostrova U tise when we sold our concept of frankness and other potential franchise hotels pytloun have shown", the number 1 contractors over the past year.
"and for the sale of the licence for the implementation of a large-scale Hotel victory in the competition for the entrepreneur of the year has served us well, adds pytloun with recognition.
The victory provided more popularity and be seen to libérec and its environs.
"people recognise me in the street, often complimented me and, I must say that it was very enjoyable," recalls.
It recommends the participation in this support to all those who try to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he uses until today, his contacts and knowledge that he could not obtain another way.
"with those that I have encountered with the help I have started to do business on a regular basis.
According to him, the renowned linked to succés has had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I see among them especially loyalty and pride to be involved in something that was generally recognized ”.
"This is not, by far, the only result of my work, but the result of good work by all of us together.
"only my name is pushed in front," said Lucas pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had in farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
With the goal of earning farmet has the worst moments behind itself.
Those who came to seek the slovansky Dum price for first place in the competition to the firm of the year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel zdarsky the owner of the company farmet.
The jury has rewarded the effort with which he has transformed a workshop tools to Ceska skalice in a company with a turnover of SEK 100 million.
"I can say that the reward was encouraged not only me, my staff and my also increased our self-confidence to combat competition today," said the winner of the competition last year.
Early in the history of the society farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the State has proposed to the father of Karel zdrasky renting a small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, it has not hesitated for a long time, has refused a career in a company where he was working at the time, and has created a society with few peers in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic baignoires.
Not very long after they have begun to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
It became after 18 years, the largest manufacturer of automatic Presses in central Europe.
The company has been known even in the non-specialized audience after the contest succés obtained through the media.
"not only are our customers have started to really learn farmet brand but also the foreign partners who have begun to realise that they were working with a company that has received the highest succés in his country of origin," said Karel zdarsky.
But the past year has E has not risen to farmet only ldans the euphoria of victory.
The valuation of the company had been based on the economic performance of 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most challenging year for the sale of mechanical engineering.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really hit the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts new materials and technologies.
"We have not escaped to this situation".
"The numbers of cases have fallen 40 per cent, and we dûmes limit our production and even dismiss," said Karel zdarsky.
A sustainable society should know that from time to time to take unpopular measures.
But they have managed the situation properly and have retained bénéficiares results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However to farmet, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with the availability of a Research and Training Centre, have strengthened the introduction of society in international salons-expositions and won major awards in the national exposure," said zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires back and with them, the number of employees.
"The new winner I want the pleasant buzz of victory but in a calm," said Karel zdarsky.
The survey, which abolishes mindless regulations.
The survey on the absurdity of the year for the fourth time is part of the clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The inglorious winner this year of the survey on the absurdity of the year has been obliged to make in the offices of documents that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voting in favour of this.
For example, the administration of Social Affairs requested a paper from the register of trade, the staff member may receive it in two clicks of a mouse.
This thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will ask the extract from the Register of Commerce for controls of insurance payments," said Jana buranova, spokesman for the Czech administration of social insurance (cssz).
Pinning all regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must meet in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the purpose of this examination of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a Party elders Hospodarske Noviny organized by business and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters have shown, it is at least 4,000 this year, which have made their voices heard.
And this is not surprising, in our country, there are various legal obligations which only hinder the business, and more.
"We are perhaps the number of documents needed for the tax declarations of the first places in the world," said Karel havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity becomes a stated aim of all Governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is the 74 th place with regard to the conditions for the company, or 8 places compared to last year.
The support of the absurdity of the year has been put in place for the first time in 2006 and continued each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can make each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, the last period before the end of the competition.
To reflect this Ya the website www.firmaroku.cz. then, organizer of the wide-open contest seven candidates for "the antiprix" and leaves the public vote during the month of October on the site and www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita www.ihned.cz.
The nonsense that has received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, that is a hundred or more exactly 105 regulations and décrêts who lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the finalists' support, therefore among the nominees is, for example, the requirement that the vehicle maintenance of motorways and high-speed routes pay tolls, or entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repeignent two rooms and two bathrooms every two years.
The list of seven proposals was published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening that participate regularly in the personalities of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and medium-sized businesses in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Czech Republic, attended the climax of the competition.
'economic prosperity may not function when the State puts âtons legs of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to remove, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs today only complicate the business, ” said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove the absurd décrêts is not an empty gesture.
In 2007, which the people did not like was the obligation on contractors to declare three days before the Office for individual firms to the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This requirement was deleted from the Act ammendement individual enterprise.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare the office of labour a trip for a foreign worker in 30 days, has been deleted from the text of Law on the so-called green card.
And everything is OK until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of the year 2009 has been the décrêt for physiotherapists have a large mirror in the Cabinet, a refrigerator and two machine scales.
This has been changed by ordinance of the Ministry of Health the year dernière-l' obligation to have a refrigerator has been deleted.
A new category will reward socially responsible companies.
Assessing the humanitarian, ecological projects, training or even sports.
The novelty of this year Hospodarske Noviny competition, which already exists for five years, is the category called the firm responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif this competition is the support to the company a reasonable and fair.
"We want to support companies that monitor the company's impact on the environment and lead a socially responsible," said Patrick bartholdy, the Regional Manager of the mobile phone operator Vodafone, the firm, which is the guardian and promoter of the contest, as in the case of support for the rebel of the year.
In this first year of the subsidy of the support of the firm of the year 2010, organised by the firm Vodafone, have registered companies that have no succés with one long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is guiding and an independent article would be to publish.
Although the purpose of their business is different from one another may be considered their support activity and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it relates to persons with disabilities and the personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the Czech Republic is not the public company netera pragoise and that supports the establishment of informal sports teams of employees who participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is isolit-bravo society for 17 years, which is the main contributor to the Endowment Fund, which is sponsoring the disabled children.
Care workers with health problems are still the old factory podebrad paper which employs more than 70 per cent, and for this, won the title of the firm responsible for the Central Bohemia region and placed third in the region in support of the firm of the year organized by Vodafone.
A Olomouc is miryz soft, a financial company, who won for the introduction of more flexible working hours and reduced up to 35 hours per week on average, and this proportionellement, without loss of pay.
The jury déverné him the title because it priority achête manufacturers Czechs, supports a ditoyenne activity in the immediate environment of and concern for the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible for our business and our administration to have the least impact on the environment", explains miluse ryznarova, the Executive Director of the society.
The company responsible for it enlogit the region of Ústi also think about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a Chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the services of catering to a local protected plant for its actions.
"Furthermore, we support the Human Rights Foundation in the shadows that assists the local Roma community," said Ondrej suchy the representative of society.
The latest row is also for its activities, a society of washing and cleaning of the Region of Karlovy Vary, which participates in the retirement of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"in our society, we are contributing to food, transport, the increase of qualifications and leisure," said Joseph strapac the construction company bruntal czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
Were automatically enrolled in the class company responsible, all regional finalists for the assistance of the firm of the year by Vodafone, which had responded to the questionnaires in enclosure document for registration and had returned to the organizer before 15 August.
The answers are incomplete or incomplete in the questionnaire were removed for examination by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in the race had not responded to questions, they could not participate in the examination of the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the competition“ main ” the firm of the year by Vodaphone. "
"The Independent markings are not possible because it is a subset of the main contribution of the firm of the year," said Karel Goldman of the Convenor bison & rose.
The Land Fund in Plzen, police have made arrests in a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives were handcuffed to the local contractor and merchant Lubos estate.
He had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the ground that is obtained by a candidate determined.
It should pay to Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police continued a person for insider dealing in the framework of a tender and a public concour." stated for the newspaper Pravo the chief prosecutors of Plzen Antonie zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide further explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police were called after 24 hours that contractor 46 years in freedom.
To know how it could affect public support, we can only speculate the little official information.
A question of pravo, the spokesman for the Land Fund lubomira Cerna indicated that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen on a separate place to work, and that, in the course of public competitions.
"It was a client, and in any case an employee, she noted.
The public examination according to Cerna is as true name 'call to propose, for the transfer of land under the Lands Act "and was put in place when several candidates are beneficiaries of the right.
"These people are proposing, within the framework of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions which must be resolved before being announced the value of the land".
"According to the proposed classification of buyers is established and the transfer of land to the ground to the person who proposed the most senior", explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information concerning persons who were registered, and as it is itself also a person bénéficiare as having purchased a large number of repossessions, it had proposed to candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And it probably encaissait to withdraw.
Which would explain why there was so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above fdt standards (land).
It appeared in the case of the former head of Vaclav fdt sankot who was prosecuted on criminal charges of preparing land for which it had already issued a decision on establishment of a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place that should be built the artery access to the industrial zone of borske pole.
Later he échangea with the Town Hall for a building in the historic centre of the town whose value is far higher.
The mayor was forced to accept because it might put the construction in jeopardy by a block of land.
Households will pay a supplement of 100 kroons monthly for housing.
Households will from January pay a supplement, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sanitation supplies of heating and some places will also rent.
The families will therefore from January from their wallets until a hundred kroons monthly more than now.
Electricity is 4.6 per cent, the gas to almost 2 per cent more expensive in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth of the supply of water, and in many places the central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase is projected electricity for households in apartment 100 kroner anuellement more than at present.
However all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including solar cells.
The gas is increasing moderately, but of course at the time when people most need to heat and therefore have a greater consumption.
We can therefore count 100 crowns.
Although electricity and gas are rising throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from town to town.
It is mainly the biggest municipalities who plan the price increases.
For example, households to Pardubice or Hradec kraloce pay starting in January for the central heating almost 50 kroons per month, families of libérec will pay more than 1000 DKr annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague prepares an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation in case the city rent increases.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay a supplement of 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation, increase of 7.4 per cent.
The price of rent will increase significantly, for example in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January to the end of regulation.
For example, the company which owns byty Court in Usti nad Labem almost 2,500 flats, has agreed an increase of up to 100 per cent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Rent regulated than paying people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10%.
The Czechs are the rum and saoûlent Fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and quite slowly.
The Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best marks of whisky are stolen for parents.
The drinks, which are most often those saoûlent, who have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who were treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
It is the experience of doctors who face similar cases to admissions departments children hospitals.
"The beers and wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be saoûl".
"The trend is really the spirits," said for pravo ludek Pelikan, Head of Department of Children horovice hospital in Central Bohemia region.
"when they manage to chiper a bottle to Papa in the wardrobe, he is sometimes wisky but the Fernet and vodka which prevail.
"vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and not feel", said the head of the Department.
Eva jurinova, spokesman for the hospital motol, also gives it right.
"In general, it is rum or Fernet".
"today is alcohol fashionable especially in elementary schools".
"in some cases, it has acted slivovice they have brought down the house," added jurinova.
According to the Head of Department, see pélikan drunk children aged 13 to 14 years for admissions to hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working at horovice since last year, it was motol where he held ten years precisely in paediatrics as ambulances brought schoolchildren wide around drunk.
"a young girl was hospitalized and four times
"She acommencé his career at 12 years old when she was involved with 3.5 per 1,000 dansle blood alcohol with a mixture with the extasy", described the doctor this case particularly important.
"she was at the Parc des Expositions of holesovice at a party".
"What is interesting is that it has not appeared as strange to the mother that her daughter is absent in 48 hours," said surprised the Department Director.
It is precisely the lack of parents or their tolerance to face the fact that their reject engaged in drinking, which are the main cause of the development of alcoholism.
According to the experts, it does not, however, in the strict sense, for children.
Under the banner "alcohol dependency is a chronic alcohol for several years, with all the attendant phenomena but not found among children".
"among those who use the acool repeatedly, it is rather an unfavourable family back-ground significantly," explained the Head of Department pélikan.
According to the Spokesperson jurinova drunk, about 40 children have been hospitalised this year until mid-November in the Paediatric Clinic at motol.
Are integrated into the stastistiques that cases with a grâve intoxication requiring hospitalization.
Children who are drunk after the emergency care brought home by the parents or by the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite according to pélikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"either they drink by spite after poor results, or on the contrary they are celebrating the start of the holiday period".
"of course I have lived in the day witches an admission from 7 children drunk at a stroke," stressed pélikan.
The child drunk who spent the night in hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is, paradoxically, in a better position than returned home and the aftermath of the "hangover".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients, which the body needs.
"they are better off for it as they spend a good evening then awakening and a sweet nothing their hurts".
"They are just surprised the location," adds pélikan knowing that from time to time that STRIKER good humour of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospital intensive care bed up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"from time to time, I used it as a means of education in which children express their drunkenness has cost, and they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," added pélikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their depleted, management should recover from parents charges related to care, do not treat children drunk.
Two l-159 jets for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two l-159 jets five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged Casa c-295m transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer casa-eads.
This is the first time that this type of aircraft is owned by someone other than the Czech Army.
They have, however, been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is l-159t1 biplaces versions of which were until now in service in the army of the Czech Republic and in a State.
Remaining aircraft lestrois monoplaces versions of the l-159.
They are parked at the moment and aéro vodochody homes through trade — the firm omnipol - took into account last week.
According to Jan pejsek of the Press Department of the Ministry of Defence, the departure of vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
'The l-159 jets monoplaces planned for the exchange were taken on aircraft stored for a long time without cause or additional investments for the Ministry of Defence ".
"The l-159 biplaces T1 were exchanged in the state," said for pravo pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without loveseat because the Ministry had signed in May 2009 with aéro vodochody agreement worth $200 million for the conversion of four monoplaces l-159 biplaces unused in two.
The army has taken delivery of the first plane in July, the second is scheduled for delivery by the end of this year.
According to pejsek EADS pledged to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"in the contract, it is clear that whoever takes the l-159 jets is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots of NATO countries".
"It is therefore the case that takes into account how to achieve that," said pejsek.
Hospodarske Noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not concerned by the l-159.
The exchange of five l-159 for an aircraft Casa and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion kroner was endorsed last year by the Government of Mirek topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not bidding and contacted directly EADS.
The Directorate of defence arguments while the exchange provides a future export l-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought at aéro vodochody 72 aircraft and uses that 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa is likely to have legal implications.
The European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen through a tender at European level and in no way directly a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three aircraft CASA, the latter should arrive in Prague airport kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the ring is a sign of low risk of cancer.
Men who have the index more than the ring are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"our findings show that the length of the finger on a straightforward test of risk of prostate cancer, especially for males before age 60," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, Professor at the Institute for cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine what men should undergo testing for prostate cancer, including by combining with the genetic risk aggrâvants or other factors, such as family health antécedents added Eeles.
During the period of 1994-2009 she followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of his right hand shorter than the ring.
For them, as for the 19 per cent of those who had the fingers of the same length, it was found the same likelihood of a prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index more than the ring the risk is, however, dropped to 33 per cent for men before 60 years the reduction of risk has risen to 87 per cent.
The length of two fingers cited - trained during the prenatal period - including different levels of sex hormones, which is exposed to the child in the womb.
A less testosterone is an index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone, which help in the development of a prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur vacla paces, Czech généticien renowned and former President of the Academy of Sciences, said for KTC that it is aware of this study but it seems not, apparently, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is "completely demonstrated".

"The soldier was used mainly in such a way that it found the target, send him a laser beam to determine the distance, gives a precise target that it corrects his included site and based on the rebound.
"say you have referred to 543 metres".
"when you pressez détente, the weapon was fired and the distance of 543 yards more or less 1, 2, 3 meters, said audette.
400 jobs delocalized
The Group Fujitsu relocates its subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 staff will transfer to Astro park their place of work, which is currently in the office building of the place mareinbader in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese Group Fujitsu relocates its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As affirmed by Wednesday, the giant specializing in the production and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located on the city marienbader Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a vast complex of offices located on the street lyoner Straße niederrad headquarters in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman said that in the medium term, the Group should consolidate 100 other jobs still scattered in the region so far.
The supply of rental was extremely attractive. In addition, the offices at Astro Park area open to better suited to the mode of work of staff.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The General Manager, Bernd Wagner, said: "frankfurt-niederrad constitutes for us a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
He claims that the connection to the airport is of great importance to a comprehensive as Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company in the region was yesterday the joy of winning and caused the disappointment of losing out.
The Economic Affairs Officer of the city of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that, once again, a 'global player' had been conquered.
It is an extraordinary act of faith "on location".
Fujitsu is in the city and its location is an important impetus for niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The Directorate has very soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr. korwisi.
However, friendly relations did nothing to change the difficulties of manufacturer of computers with the owner of the building at marienbader.
In the end, the economic reasons have been decisive.
Now it is a unique place if remain empty for long.
"I hope that the owner and licensor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the place of the town hall, used so far by the company, Fujitsu and the "small vertical" nearby, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad, were part of the construction of the controversial spas.
A joint project of the city and a private developer of projects, a new entrance to the town was established between the station and the town hall, which prompted widespread criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of surfaces that were formerly part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company performance and investment advice, FERI, the manufacturer of computer systems for the distribution of travel, start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into their buildings.
In 2006, the German group specialized in Frankfurt immobilien-chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu in the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to Spanish society Falcon real estate investments its based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the third largest supplier of technology products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers to businesses and provides the essential service.
Its branch office established in the region of rhin-main is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu are surely more employees in Munich.
The Branch, Fujitsu technology solutions, even Bad Homburg to settle at frankfurt-niederrad. Other subsidiaries operating in this site are Fujitsu services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square metres have rented in the building Astro Park.
The ancient complex of twenty years, whose name recalls his plan in the form of Star, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of electronic and electrical engineering.
The expulsion of the server by Amazon - threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly difficult.
The Internet service provider, Amazon has removed from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange is apparently in England.
In the United States, the website WikiLeaks was attacked with more force.
The Group of cyber-activistes "WikiLeaks' no longer has access to its server housed up here in America and is now seeking a server in Europe.
During this time, the distinguished American senator, Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"WikiLeaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"freedom of expression in countries of freedom", reported Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activistes behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-entreprise, Amazon, had deleted the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activistes have resorted to Amazon web services (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, WikiLeaks continues its revelations: "fantastic, our dollars are being spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
The television channel CNN, citing the office of Mr Liebermann, reported that Amazon forbade WikiLeaks to use its servers after the investigation conducted by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee for the protection of the Territory had threatened the site Amazon to orchestrate a boycott against her, told the British newspaper "the guardian".
"I would have hoped that Amazon takes the measure earlier with regard to previous publications by WikiLeaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called upon other countries to deny the use of servers by the platform.
"WikiLeaks is illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it puts our national security at risk and jeopardize life throughout the world," according to a statement from the independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, be it American or foreign, should assist WikiLeaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information transmitted by the London newspaper the independent ", the Australian of 39 years lived in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activiste has consistently described manoeuvres orchestrated by detractors prosecution against her by Sweden.
The spokesman for WikiLeaks, kristinn hrafnsson, said in London that threats were made against the site.
"calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why particular Assange fears for his safety, said hrafnsson.
That is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike huckabee, has demanded that the leaders of revelations by WikiLeaks is tried and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Adviser to the head of Government of Stephen Harper said on television, clearly so ironic that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, an argument broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and leaked recently, to engage in espionage.
"I do not know exactly why we must take the opinion of an individual owner of a web site," said Mr Gibbs.
"our foreign policy, and the interests of the country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The US Government is now fully to test the protection of databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counterterrorism Center, has been appointed head to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is mandated to implement "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the leaked diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the US Government announced that it wanted to address the safety of dissidents and activists if ever they were threatened by the WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have done everything possible to get in contact with them," said the State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the lens
“gelato University of Bologna, it prepares the confectioners of ice to best seasons of the year.
The induction course organized three days of future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
In fact, where the ice?
The glacier and the ice machine.
The Glacier, i.e. in German the producer somewhat old-fashioned ice cream factory, in accordance with all the rules of the Italian Art of ice.
The turbine to remove ice cream ice chilled the showcase with the help of a spatula, provides in the gaufre and then began to sell.
To his knowledge, there was no need to go to Anzola Dell Emilia in Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "gelato-university" of the Italian firm carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the University of ice in 2003 so that the ice cream out of its machines are everywhere to Italian ideals.
The induction course organized three days of future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Are also offered special courses on the lens of chocolate and extending over several days. Similarly, meetings are held in closed glacerie.
In full crisis of quarantine, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply to achieve their ardent desire on the ice smooth.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, Brazil to Saudi Arabia from Hungary.
Jacky, Professor of artistic education come to California is the movement's football-mad slow food. It intends to propose to a future European product quality in the countries of the ice.
Anke Berlin Counsellor in business management and it wants, after a few years, make something unique in this profession rather nerve-wracking.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another time of Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the wife of Canadian households came because his children love the Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari explained to participants the best characteristics of ice perfect.
Is crucial not only to the good taste, but also the flexibility soyeuse and the right consistency.
However, Luciano has not forgotten during training the icing on the cake of the superstructure and, in general, of the South: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a massive dose of romanticism."
The first step in the production seems quite simple.
Luciano provides the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large gas boiler which to 85 degrees through an electronic platform, then cool immediately to four degrees.
Then he opens a valve installed on the machine: it has a white cream pasteurisée basis, the foundation of all kinds of ice in milk.
The instructor was immediately besieged by question: is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without inhibitor?
How can we give free rein to the pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano cautions were misled by the spirit of the times.
Whoever does that ice, "made from natural ingredients," may nevertheless used stabilizers: the more often a natural product, for example the seed of flour guar obtained from the beans of guar.
It is of course possible to manufacture ice without using inhibitor, just to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer croquera nothing other than ice pellets.
Some modifications of the estate are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavourings.
The owner Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that it acquires in the candy or fruit from the supermarket.
In addition, there are the powder and pasta.
"suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of ingredients flavoured."
"However, you should simply try."
Revenue in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fruit costs.
In the ice cream made from the mass of white base, adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and, when you add the cocoa powder, the basis of all the chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants must go to the use of machines to ice.
Luciano invites them to produce four kinds of lenses: vanilla, chocolate, the Moka and kernel with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ice in the fruit are also subject to the same experience.
Most of fragrances, more fruit purée: from the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely best.
The ice to hazelnuts is not necessarily the taste of the nut, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
The ice in Kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and less than inhibitor.
"Only a properly balanced mixture is the taste of a lens," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation: If one uses the puree with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar to be reduced in the recipe.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for the ice to lemon.
Luciano present a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (winegrowers are used to measure the degree of oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of the ice does not require, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic machine to manufacture the mass of aid.
There is also an instrument which is simultaneously the mixture of ice to make it available onctueux and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automatisations, small breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barbouille of fruit puree from head to foot and, thus, éclabousse his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes.
The owner Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident that may occur in every way: it is only a matter of time".
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry which is piloting the cultivation of genetically modified crops has hijacked the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Group of Experts testbiotech which is regarded as an independent institute for the evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph then, Director of testbiotech.
There are reports that the Chairman of the Group of Experts EFSA for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts EFSA is under contract with the ILSI pressure group.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of test requirements of EFSA for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr then.
The requirements are developed, by letter, to the position of the pressure group ILSI and bear the marks of industry which, in essence, would be monitored by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
This is the second time that testbiotech denounced a conflict of interest.
A high-level official of the EFSA has recently joined without condition or without transitional period, the Swiss food group Syngenta. In doing so, she moved to camp.
There is little time, even the radio Germany Central (mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of a personal relationship between the authority of the European Union on the control and the industrial lobby, which has aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency that MEPs.
However, EFSA admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it exploits all reliable data, including those of industry, as long as they are of good quality.
It does not prohibit experts working for the authority to establish contacts with the industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he worked for the International Institute for the life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, ILSI) based in the United States.
The Agency sees itself as a neutral forum comprising experts belonging, inter alia, in the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr. then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified crops are accepted without any testing of food animals and that it was not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize in scope," says Mr. then.
The current practice is to test only the proteins isolated and not a genetically modified plant, which makes it difficult to obtain reliable results.
"If we do not search the risks, how can we discover them?" asked Mr. then on an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika hilbeck.
This scientific research since 1994 in the field of genetics and currently works at the Polytechnic in Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly influence or discredit the scientific criticism.
That is why there are barely even researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the view of the business, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. hilbeck says that "industry control security research".
The trace of Pierre
Uli gsell has procured a total of approximately 400 kg.
On Monday afternoon, she was at the station in Stuttgart with a tube to his back.
There were manif.
It was snowing.
History is known: in September, the excavators moved and had begun to demolish a large part of the North wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer on the same: thousands of people have protested against the proposed S21, the transformation of the central station in Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration resulted in the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The muschelkalk (limestone coquillier) crailsheim, a stone and rude poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. gsell is a sculptor of 43 years residing in ostfildern.
It has purchased a few fragments.
"those stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He said with enthusiasm: "A Roche modest and simple and cheap land."
It said that cutting the fashion, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet clear what he will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli gsell too.
The traces of stones of Stuttgart in a former munitions depot of the French army in a forest near tubingue, where Manuel rongen has built its empire stones.
This man is 44 years old trade.
He bought all the stones from the demolition at Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were concassées or if they disappear in the landfill," say in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says that he has been subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the North wing of the demolition company.
But it has negotiated for whole days with opponents of the project S21.
And he explained that he could not do anything to stop the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 subsequently won a stone parallélépipède weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some custody as memory in hoping to make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads a truck.
About half are still packed together in the forest, the rest were long sold.
Owners of gardeners, landscape gardens, individuals.
They came across and took away everything that could go into the boot and trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart scandal into long "mäuerle" or limitations of the toes of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing in particular," said Mr. rongen.
"This component eut-été policy."
He enters his four-wheel drive vehicle, made the turn of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He had done studies of law that it has abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before turning to the information and eventually become a carrier.
And an amateur stones.
It stores 40000 tones.
It is accumulating wealth everywhere in Germany.
It claims that it is the largest retailer of old stones.
It is réfrène.
Stones carved with sand art are posed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the bridge to marienbrücke in Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with relish.
"My favourite stone."
It takes the road that rises through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre of red sand, previously part of the station of Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Nice travertin."
The parallélépipède was once part of the gallery of neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Across the snow stones and stories of the travertin cannstatt from the Prefecture of Police, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. blasien, the TUF from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What, what, what sweat!
When Mr. rongen think once the stones were carved by hand and displaced palans using simple and carts drawn by the horse, it becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in room."
It has not become rich, still less wealthy.
But the carrier today employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a souffleur of glass and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is gratifying," says the waste recycler.
Soon, he must travel to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Fight of talent to win the senior potential
The counter is great pressure.
16 students are to buy bread rolls to salmon, tomato puree and blancs-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and engineering at a workshop.
In the framework of a competition of ideas, they must speak profession on the car of the future with the developers of VW, and know the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies did not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to find best brains and engage, as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to hire the most talented graduates as much as possible in the lecture halls before they enter the labour market and they are are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements regarding the performance of their students, it tries to identify exceptional talent in the framework of practical projects and retention.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of brauschweig the automotive group amadoue talents.
A young lady from service of staff shared the pens, sweets and cards bearing the logo of Volkswagen.
She spoke of the calendar of vocational courses and jobs students young talents; it shows the paths for access to the compound of the Group.
It is Nico Chump at the Technical University of Braunschweig, who is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "students are in contact with the industrial sector and are gaining experience."
"the Volkswagen group, he may hear students, look more closely the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter into account as a friend."
According to Mr. sirloin, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was more on the professional project", says Mr Chump.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become even more bitter.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their staff through a screening on a host of candidates.
But they should brag about their reliability and woo the highly skilled work force.
It is mainly graduates from the engineering who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineers posts remained vacant in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, a vacuum on the post of Engineer expands further.
Roman dykta goes on the hunt for talent for KPMG, the auditing firm, forensic accounting and Council.
It organizes costly events aimed at the recruitment of talent, as for example the race kpmg-race cruise, a kind of rallye-papier where competitors must find their way to the GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight and promising students next year so they walk this way in the United States.
Participants can also visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the company.
Who should participate is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. dykta, the means used for the pursuit of high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the batch through the race cruise."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little ”
For the hunter of talent that is Mr. dykta, the account appears to be.
"until now, we have been in contact with all the persons who took part last year in a similar action."
"some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to send their requests soon to our business," he says.
In addition to the direct amadouement inside the Campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are quite common in attending trade fairs where they are engaged in the hunt for brains.
"We are trying to achieve the graduates participating in the fairs."
"for example, at the Salon of solar technologies," said Ms. Sitha stübe, Director of Human Resources at solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. stübe is aware of the problems linked to the rotation.
Currently, 35 posts are set to contest on the site.
"at the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This is expensive and time-consuming," authenticity?
Another way to establish contact is to move by university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"teachers reported that the student has the possibility to conduct training courses or write his draft end to study at home. ”
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced in the solar specialists.
It is for this reason that the company is trying to make his advertisement highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy flat and easy communication.
"often, a large group cannot do this," says Ms. stübe, Chief of Staff.
There has long been that money is no longer the main role in the search for employment.
The flexible working hours, the custody of children or good opportunities for promotion are other factors.
According to a study conducted by the great place to work Institute, solarworld ranks 55th place among the 100 best employers for Germany.
The Institute provides a table of honour of German employers.
To this end, he questioned the staff about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while watching the framework conditions for employees.
The Chief of Staff Dr. stübe hopes that this will foster the image of society with job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly with external assessments with regard to a potential employer," it declares.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy Debba (Deutscher use branding Akademie, Debba) advises companies wishing to build a good reputation as an employer in applying a long-term strategy.
He advises clients to show more of authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means primarily domestic measures.
"the best way for an employer to make attractive is through its own staff", he says.
That is, after the jargon in the sector, the internal branding strategy, i.e. the creation of the image of the employer within his own ranks.
"The met Office is the best messengers."
When it treats its employees and that they identify with the company, they are all advertising of their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if it was playing in an orchestra, ” said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast, south-east of the United States, over the coming years.
Washington has imposed a ban a ban and, thus, permanently revoked its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new wells are currently banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, "drilling rig Deepwater Horizon" which is at the origin of this strict ban. It shall remain in effect for at least the next five years.
In response to the accident that killed 11 workers and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, had indicated that it was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign countries for oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the disastrous spill in the Gulf has not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of billions, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze of drilling imposed after the explosion of the Platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling.
With stricter controls and tougher safety instructions, Obama and Salazar wants to prevent further disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after many accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of in-depth reform.
At the same time, Mr. Obama has pledged to remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warned about the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case at present.
"The Government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the sector of gas and oil," according to the results of a survey conducted in the current sector by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance regret the uncertainty which characterises this sector: "nobody knows exactly what will change with the Regulation."
Investments made in support of new projects have been postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is functioning; Brown, it releases a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: because of a large, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine akpobari has a good intention.
"Do you not exhausted," launching the green activist to journalists for the calm: "you today still enough mud of oil before the lens of water."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young depressed boueuse in water up to his chest, as well as the surrounding fat drag: this scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water to the colour of the Rainbow.
You may not realize that the basement full of brown water of crude oil.
On the shore of the river bodo-jetty, Esther badom recounts that, once she was collecting buckets of shrimp, whole here.
But in the meantime the calm waters had completely dried up.
Five years ago there was an enormous amount of oil has bounced from a pipeline had exploded in the vast swamp.
The fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo must now swim for six hours to reach the fishing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted in the world.
The full extent of the devastation evident when it passes through the mangrove swamps travels by rivers.
Instead of a clear water, the motor vessel heartrending brown water cradingue. Anyone who puts his hand the cut any covered with oil.
The roots of mangrove small corner of the ground as sticks of isolated réglisse. Palm trees are sadly hang their palms.
One looks in vain the clouds of birds, as it usually present in the wetlands: as soon as the outboard motor stops, a shadowy silence is approaching this paradise of once resembling a petrol station by the smell that it generates.
"what happens here, this is war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine akpobari air sad: "our life is characterized by a permanent danger in relation to health."
The comparison of war is made.
The region is home to the Ogoni people besieged a battlefield for decades: there are more than 60 years, the first European explorers have entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken saro-wiwa. it was performed later. In 1993, the Group shell was forced to stop its production activities in this region, because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni countries is prohibited in this society: while more than 2 million barrels of oil daily are pumped through more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7 000 kilometres of pipelines in the whole of the Delta region, three times as great as Switzerland, the country's oil fields are tapped Ogoni, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
Every few hundred metres stand in water of steel tréteaux as weird sculptures: it means very affectionate "Christmas trees," the head of drilled holes.
They have up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion until benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a head of drilling of this nature snaps from time to time in the piece, as a constant flow of crude oil flows through the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which has passed into the sea during the accident on super-pétrolier "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
That should be the responsibility of continuing environmental pollution? The answer to this question has divided the player.
For the Group shell, sabotage and siphonage pipelines are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution. The environmentalists, for their part, see the explosions of warheads drilling and pipeline punctured as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scholar Richard Steiner criticized the Shell Group in Nigeria of security standards mostly less strict than anywhere else in the world: only the rate of failures of pipelines was "much higher than alleures".
Some emerging forms of mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles a workshop abandoned, full of cambouis and installed outdoors: they are completely naked and covered in cambouis up to the neck.
A lamp scintille under one of the many barrels which sometimes linked to pipes, sometimes scattered without grounds on the site must be répérés: a small illegal refinery.
It warmed the crude oil into the barrel for several hours, said Michael, the team leader.
Initially, the petrol enters a receptacle through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct of drops kerosene fall and finally the diesel.
It is as well that Michael and his four friends four daily barrels of diesel 300 litres: "We reported 34 million Naira", about $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta to take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than ridiculously low of just 40 euro cents per litre of diesel: as they acquire them free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of pipelines in successful throughout the country of the Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses this way at least 16 million gallons of crude oil in the Niger Delta.
Only a small part quite insignificant to the raw material is temporarily stored illegally cleansed: organized crime networks which are also among its members of politicians and senior military officers, responsible for the lion's share of the tankers and dumping on the world market.
The activist akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether to award the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities in the public or the mode of production lax is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the lives of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, the relationship of the Ogoni especially to shell had so deteriorated that it did not matter that the withdrawal of the Group. ” Perhaps operators with other nationalities, as the Chinese, will prove to be better. "
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time you déguerpissiez" announced the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can arise at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by special units of the armed forces, they are not the subject of an arrest, but at best they will offer bribes.
Even the most soldiers from the north of the country will benefit as all Nigerians from the first.
"at any point of view, this rotten trick has led our countries' low akpori regrets.
Investigators discovered defects in the construction of new reactors.
The A380 is clearly a major security problem.
In considering an aircraft has made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defects that could lead to "catastrophic failure" of the reactor.
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers on the Airbus belonging to the airline Quantas had obviously been far more likely: during the investigation, the Australian air safety found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft were a serious security problem, and it warns against a possible default of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leakage in the connection of the conduct of oil, was a concern in an opinion published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure" of reactors.
Are concerned the reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and 20 aircraft for the A380.
The Airbus for the airline Quantas, who had emergency landing on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now started legal proceedings against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a suit in a Federal Court of Australia headquartered in Sydney. This approach provides an opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The Director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company, sue for damages in relation to the incident in early November.
The parts were separated and the bearing surface was damaged in a fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, the combustion of oil that is at the origin of the damage.
After that incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be done on the superjumbos that are also equipped with reactors.
The recommendations of security are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman, Martin Dolan astb.
The security problem is deemed important enough to inform all the parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of the aircraft, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily halted three of his 11 A380.
The airline Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of the A380.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The snow throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany any covered in White: in one night, the Snow fell almost throughout the country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is grelotter Germany: by freezing temperatures, almost the entire Republic is covered with snow in the Thursday night, which led to chaos in many places.
In the north and east, snow cover reached 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the A7 in Flensburg, national staff of winter worked permanently, but they could not overcome the snow continued to pile up.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for maritime navigation and hydrography (DSH) expects this tsunami occurred on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein, with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
The piles of snow on motorways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the central weather warning meteomedia announced the level warning violet was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow, high winds and expenses have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck at night.
Even in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced severe disruption on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused an interruption of traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snow hit motorways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruption of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
The main issues are: the snow on the railways, the trees fell on the tracks, the caténaires or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, it had to interrupt the leipzig-nuremberg interregional transport.
At sallfeld in Thuringia, a train ice to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The fire brigade and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers from the train in blankets, food and drink.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The snow caused numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman of the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for FRAPORT said that 40 flights have already been cancelled at Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are more numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are available.
The accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening at ostholstein, a lorry driver has died in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident happened not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was stationary.
The driver has died.
Four passengers were injured in the train, that is why the road from Bayreuth in Nuremberg was closed until the early hour of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car was located on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists predicted good news: the snow is still soft and powdery tourbillonnera, but in the case of small bursts.
But the winds will subside.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent winds and quick.
It is, however, very cold, at least 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is seeking to secede from emblem: According to information reported by the newspaper, the financial institution is seeking buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
That building could generate up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautify the headquarters of the Group: the twin towers in the neighbourhood of cases have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers had to return to their former place of service.
Henceforth, the financial group is clearly trying to recover the costs of renovation and is seeking a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check if it is more interesting to occupy ourselves buildings or sell them, and new hire later".
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already sold its Headquarters shortly after.
It was only in 2007 that the Bank had acquired the twin towers for a total of 272 million euro from the holders of own funds. It had then rehabilitated.
The changes to the energy optimization have gobbled up, according to some estimates, roughly 200 million euros.
A sale would net, of course, a lot of money in the bank.
According to information provided by the journal, the experts from the industry believe the value of revolutions, renamed Meanwhile "Green towers", about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, we do not know today whether the buildings will be sold to a fund owned by the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the children who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been thinking about the buried miners who had been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
It had not yet been able to trace the body because the security situation of the affected wells continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River mine near the town of greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 years of age had been buried under Earth.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but it had not found any trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second detonation violent, the authorities had considered that minors had no chance of survival.
So far the bodies could not be increased.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun to greymouth south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, it has installed 29 tables on which you could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Photographs and personal belongings, including clothes and planks of surfing, also took their place.
The flags were put in Bern before all public buildings in the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the memorial day that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that minors have occurred on the surface.
"but they are never returned to the House."
Mr Lawrie drew Zen, whose son was buried in graves said he cannot resign itself to accept the death of her son while he has not seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats have taken part in the commemorative day.
Minors of origin of South Africa and the United Kingdom were also buried in the first explosion of 19 November.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine in the South Island of New Zealand.
The Police Commissioner Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, hot temperatures inside the mine began to fall.
Goes to hell, warrior!
The film is an artificial splatter film?
Nicolas winding refn's film exploring the limits of former thanks to his film, "Valhalla over rising", the epic fighter.
In what the Danish Director Nicolas winding refn he might suggest turning "Valhalla over rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) not having one eye is taken prisoner; it is his executioner and, with an almost supernatural, removes his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our heroes used brutal methods of murder when he is bad mood, he snatched the intestines of its enemies without waiting until they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed says no word on his true name. Even the other characters leak, at most, in one or two sentences some terrible screams of agony.
Otherwise, it says nothing and feasting in the mountainous landscape fantastically beautiful Scotland which is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
That would be the ideal more mature film-makers having an interest in the existentialisme and travellings excellent.
When a film is a number of target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The filmmaker winding refn is considered, since "pusher", his trilogy on the fierce drug trafficker and full of style, as a kind of Quentin tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to make a little more in the mood to mainstream or introduce a little less brutality of cinema.
Most supporters of the cinema of art must face the horror in the brain that is spreading around and intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed entering, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silenced.
It is not surprising that "Valhalla over rising" has no distributor of films in Germany and that it only exists in the DVD format.
This is mainly because of beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, hiding behind a bloody and pretentious appearance.
It is not a question of dialogues in the film, or a coherent, everything is ready, a frantic dream turned into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn gives him barely a moment of détente and slowly cut her throat with images of a cold and gloomy soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that came from the heart of the characters.
Only a blond boy, which is fairly alongside the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all others are motivated by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never known, but who the hell is at any moment to combat enemies and allies in temporarily turned into warrior, is perhaps as envoy of the Devil himself.
It represents the decline, but also, perhaps, for those who are, in any case, the scrap heap.
"Valhalla over rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hating or admire, who has designed the agitation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earth-moving work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provides further guidance regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, still less to submit to inspections by the Agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four (F-15 fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious Israeli building cubic shape on Syrian territory.
It is situated on the banks of the Euphrates, the largest city near located 30 kilometres is Dair as-sur.
His name appears in documents of the IAEA, as it is a question of the Syrian nuclear reactor allegedly built with help from North Korea in parallélépipède stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric power.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-kibar, would be able to produce plutonium for the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images are blurred.
Through the computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, it submitted photographs showing the building located in close proximity and internally.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, it has barely more information at the time, and with time the mystery grows increasingly.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a nuclear reactor at el-kibar but had peu' indices showing the country "was an active programme of nuclear weapons".
Some intelligence agents in Europe tend to be more cautious and speak only of an alleged "reactor", even if they consider the introduction of the CIA as "plausible".
The lack of evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
Asked about how it ensures that it is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat Nations gave a terse response in been in affirming that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly removed with haste the rubble of "unused military building" and conducted a systematic levelling the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered at el-kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, IAEA received through a Member State satellite images of commercial providers showing the moment that followed directly the attaque. it seems that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has gained in exclusivity.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always maintained that she had never made a secret atomic programme and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found at the site of weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has rejected that argument after The PM analysis as an implausible.
Since that time, Damascus denies any discussion on this, as on the satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-kibar and denial of access to the rubble of buildings destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never comments on this subject".
It is as well that the investigation on this matter has been dragging on since June 2008 without reaching an outcome and that it "is increasingly becoming a serious problem for the credibility of the Agency ”, as recognized in a senior Western diplomat in service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
IAEA considers that to make progress, we must clarify the existence of three other facilities which must have "a substantive report" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities here, and what is their function or are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ', they are known within IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan masyaf iskandariayah, and also the name of neighbouring towns.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near masyaf which would most probably be a suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly adjacent to it; this is exactly why Syria refuses access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it contends that the Syrians feared that the inspection group is in fact spies who were sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on its military installations.
Indeed, it is the information provided by the American secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA provides information, including satellite photos indicating that vehicles have been shuttling between the three locations and the stone parallélépipède to carry substances.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "serve to fuel production".
There would be "no indications concerning sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This reactor is certainly working through not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is a plausible assumptions on the fundamental questions: where should have come and where uranium or plutonium separated later needed to manufacture a bomb.
It is unclear whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored at the three sites.
When the hundreds of truckloads of Earth will have disappeared, no one has information on the location of the rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has been considered in 1998 the salt mine of al-tibni, located only a few miles from el-kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
Analysis of recent satellite photos for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
The satellite photos show that Syria has begun work in the three suspect sites and pumped huge containers where the IAEA began demanding access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but that has not helped to avert suspicion.
As it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to be carried out. This plan should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the Inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also made a mockery of this proposal.
A year ago, while Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be brought to this case, argues, for example, Glyn Davies, the Ambassador of the United States, which mentions a few months ago what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who has had to offer these inspections, has already talked about "an option that I am open to the future," but it still hesitate.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the Board of Governors of the IAEA and a good number of 35 countries which are represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as the diplomat who gives réflechir: "at this point, if in the end they did not find anything".
Love in the time of war
It goes wrong since Angelina Jolie made his debut in the summer as a producer.
She wrote the script itself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
There is nothing more to this story, but that is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumour suggests that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love with his torturer of Serbia during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian Women's federations have immediately protested. In response, some camera footage in Sarajevo were displaced in the final minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a journal bakira hasecic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the organization of women victims of war has written to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she was required to meet the actress Jolie is itself a Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR.
It is not a diplomat. A few weeks already, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"the meeting must be held in Bosnia," said hasecic.
There has been no stories of love in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie said long enough on its attitude towards the victims.
The guardian reported that the organization of hasecic subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie has written?
The Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of his scenario, after some hesitation was granted permission to film in Sarajevo, but we do not know why is not then come despite this authorization.
The young author assured itself that it does not pursue political goals with his film, that it is making great efforts it has made during the Yugoslav conflict. It maintains that it wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all parties involved to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
A second film synopsis travels on the Internet. It is quite different: lovers knew each other well before the beginning of war. We meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is quite a big difference with the version "of a rape victim is amourache his torturer".
That the film of Jolie began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, so to speak, Jolie is "unfair and based on information erronnées".
Now, only the fanatics of Hollywood can provide peace: placing illegally this scenario in the net, like many others before.
Are we!
Tonight, all is well again among the Irish.
No trace of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans howl of joy on the back of strong music, they trample the feet.
Baileyu-pub of Cork in Ireland South vibrates because players launch and manage to bring down the table tennis balls at a distance of three metres in cups of beer for the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "bière-pong". The winner is making 500 euros a ticket to go sit in January in Las Vegas to bière-pong World Championship.
Cian does this Tanner is an individual calm; the subtle game to drink and the technician reserved, both actions do not really well together.
And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years trying to have fun, to deflect the issue térébrante, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in its projects. In January, he will lead interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling," he says.
"the country is so far and I did not."
Finally: its COPINE already expects to Auckland, "less than two, She clinched his job asked as to draft factual, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because of the grim prospects in the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
The young go: the situation of the majority of families who live on the island are similar to that of Tanner.
The experts from the Institute of Social and Economic Research indicates that Irish 100,000 soon leave their country.
They even provide a number of emigrants (200,000) by 2015.
This is an enormous loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are correct, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed great fluency, grief takes all the seats.
However, the economic crisis affects mainly young Irish, well trained, experienced so far that moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three in ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper published widely readers' letters written by young immigrants, who complain: "Ireland is going to the dogs".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but one that has the potential, and our country as a whole generation."
"the last to leave off the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Union of Irish students, is plotting a future more gloomy because the Government only window dressing and offers no future for young people.
"they reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the young student of 20 years.
She sees how his comrades is clinging to a practical course not paid to another.
She said that are his biggest concerns is to emigrate itself in four years.
"This is a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen mclarnon try to positively address this theme.
Mclarnon organizes the Salon "workingabroadexpo" which provides a comprehensive paper on the theme “Working abroad ”.
"But the work abroad is new to the profession in an extraordinary opportunity to take the first step in the levels of the occupational hierarchy," said the manager.
Its website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and surfers of snow in Canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not a boat, but it also guarantees the freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to do in Ireland to the engineer of 29 years, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house lots of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on other projects hannovre or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan is rarely visit their home countries, because it is in a position to further work to complete to repay the loan to build his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit bonkers," he says as it crosses the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live now."
He broke out of an embarrassed laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential area with gardens before treatment, expensive cars of major brands are stationed on the routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan had bought the house with his sister for $380,000 euros, funded 100% by the credit.
"there were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Afraid to see any collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, once hot tea and said: "I have no children and I am young; same everything goes wrong, I can go to zero."
The engineer of the building do not like the laments that it is often these days.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not as bad as what was once lived here on the island," support.
"work during a time abroad, this is not what can be worse, perhaps it is the fact that we feel first Irish.
He laughs and spoke afterwards of his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"it was back after having spent seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply".
This idea appeals to Cian does this Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his record, it has already had a few years of working at London. That is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his COPINE.
But there is still something that worried well these last few days: the Festival to organize on his 27th birthday in Dublin.
It is concerned that it does not turn into evening of farewell.
"only, not a lot of emotions," says long gorgée drank a beer.
"a farewell, it seems quite worrying."
"call it rather an evening of goodbye, relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as to private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influence than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two interrelated aspects reflected in the results of the poll, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the sunny enough mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing attitudes towards stability, democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased to a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also grown in Mexico, where the economy rebounded after it suffered a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with how their democracy works in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25 per cent in 2001 (see figure 3)
Some 34 per cent said that they had confidence in Parliament of their countries and 45 per cent in their Government, the same as last year in both cases; but this is a significant increase compared to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If this was good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in Latin America have experienced only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty had increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes escalated.
This is only the second time since the poll began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue in their countries (see table 5).
Approximately 31 per cent say that they or one of their own had been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is declining compared to 38 per cent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance was reflected in the surge of support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, against 56 per cent in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58% think that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47 per cent last year.
Interestingly, 62 per cent of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent of respondents (compared with 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent, down 11 per cent since last year)
But the United States is seen as the most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A soiled
Nobody expected to be perfect for general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But this was much worse than the "outsiders" who wanted to help the stricken country and plunged in fear.
It presented the ballot boxes and voting, ballot papers scattered in the goutières, polling stations were ransacked and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake of January, roamed the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several frontrunners, have condemned the alleged fraud and have called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti, the United Nations, sees the event as "an election fairly good in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they "believed that these irregularities, as serious as they are, were necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are beholden to René Préval, outgoing President unpopular, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The long-awaited second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel martelly, a rap musician and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, have withdrawn their initial appeal for the vote to be annulled.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second Toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
Accordingly, many haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Almost 250,000 identity cards necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate Government and people as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And thus, it is clear, Haitians are doing themselves.
The tips of his toes to the Centre
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of sympathy from the public who has improved his approval rate of 20 points, to over 50 per cent, its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
However, transforming it into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms Fernández, visibly in mourning, that it would abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband's predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs are still confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as President, used to prepare budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has enabled the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
The Government of Ms. Fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has descended into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (where one member was struck in the face by one of its peers and others have accused the Government of corruption), Congress did not approve the budget for 2011.
"I am not going to compete," said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President yet more flexibility to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9 per cent this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1 per cent but many private estimates and the wage demands of unions, see this figure close to 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of the growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
It has refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the Statistical Office, which conducted the forgery of official statistics on inflation.
Ms. Fernández now can mitigate these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And officials say they want to limit the salary increases next year to 6 per cent.
The economy has been boosted by high world prices for agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to re-establish financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected an earlier restructuring of debt on which Argentina had not adjusted its targets in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor Governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado boudou, the economy minister, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; what appears to be a prelude to the clean-up of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of his term, now that her husband was no longer near her.
If she does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it has receded.
If it wants to win another election, it will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, noise, many of the policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
Voters in Taiwan are oriented towards a closer Union with the continent.
What does that Taiwan think its big brother, located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters were presented on 27 November, 70% of those eligible to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in what is seen as a general evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has himself become a substitute for the sentiments from the continent, having established links innovative business, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. my passed the test, but only just.
Although his ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five municipalities, it failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the démocrate-progressiste Party (DPP), which has looked to complete independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all votes for the KMT of 45 per cent.
If this had been a presidential poll, Mr MA would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the Party's vote fell by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event showed most of the main issues of the elections Taiwan, including trucks and aggressive campaign flags mass rally with girls who danced in place.
A mysterious assassination attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean link, son of link Chan, Chairman Emeritus of the KMT, has done a tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd fired on the young Mr. link, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passing.
Bizarrely, it has not been determined if the shooter wanted to do harm to Mr. link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an impact on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how the issue of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have added with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoyed de facto independence and dislikes the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT has tended to avoid deluding its links with the Beijing Government.
But this time, the DPP has also failed to stir up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, has claimed a confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government continues to provide commercial arrangements, in accordance with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China lost no time to send a negotiator in Taipei to organise a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Yes, she would also like to see a political integration; but let us start from the beginning.
Better wait for it after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it was bad: its former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison after charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocative in favour of independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a candidate of the DPP to the Presidency, as Su tseng-chang, who served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that his party present an alternative "trusted" compared to the hasty approach Mr. my about China.
Mr. Chen seemed exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidates of the PDP would have achieved better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan was a separate country.
He has even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT is introspection of oneself.
The assessments of Mr. my were low; despite a dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidate failed to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his Cabinet and its local branches will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that support in Taiwan for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese are economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: the Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding was a surprise selection in the category "best new artist".
At the request of a President, and people are bound to notice.
Esperanza Spalding, the Jazz Singer bassiste and 26 years picked by President Obama to occur during the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a major appointment in the category of "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a very well-known figure on the scene of the Jazz since his 2008 album, “Esperanza, ” the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not get more than three albums before registration; what" establishes the public identity of that artist. "
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", was certainly a step forward and, given his vocal style slightly urging, the deft hand of POP and Funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line at Spalding compared to the brilliant success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the voters of the Grammy Awards, taking into account the Jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured “historicity ” of Vijay Iyer trio in the category" instrumental album "transferred to an invigorating shudder to a recording that was the overriding favourite last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" saxophoniste veteran James Moody and "positootly" claviériste John Beasley will include in the competition.
Trombones shorty, a favorite in the voice rauque New Orleans and frequent guest "treme" on HBO, has been honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; bending also strongly towards a merger with some albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret society of the brutal Darcy James argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognition in the great together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz Billy Childs together and the eternal aventurier Dave Holland, whose album "pathways" its octet' s live was a good example of the main democratic bassiste as head of the Group.

The draft of the mosque in temecula wins the approval of the Planning Commission.
A proposed mosque in temecula has received the unanimous support of the local planning Commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project, claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the Commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious Centre complied with local laws and that it would be esthétiquement impressive.
"many people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you say," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center of temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a US citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"they just vote very strong."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 a.m. and lasted until nearly midnight, with most of the time, people voting for or against the Centre, the time almost equally distributed, according to the press-enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's web site.
"there is more of America", wrote one speaker.
"It is another planet of the apes with miss liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also prompted protests in other parts of the country, including at ground zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud harmoush denounced violence in the temecula Valley.
His congregation of about 135 families co-existe without incident in the county of Riverside for years but wanted more space and better than the warehouse was used on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque in 24,943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style would be composed of two minarets and amount to 43 feet high.
It would be a site of 4.32 acres on the road Nicolas about two miles east of high chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against this bill in the City Council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"It can be expanded with either the phosphorus, either with arsenic."
"that is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a form of life really foreign", "commented Paul Davies, C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major components have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria was discovered in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"one wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize the life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss the matter, which has not disclosed the details of the discovery, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of a life extraterrestre.
This has not been the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments, organizations might be able to use other elements to actuate the biochemistry and that the whole" standard "elements, that we are absolutely necessary for life, could not be determined," commented Charles cockell, Professor at the Institute of Planetary Research and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new, because it shows the substitution of one element to another basic Biochemistry and biochemical structure," added cockell.
This was not a casual discovery.
Felisa wolfe-simon Institute for NASA astrology, who led the study, has chosen the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it was speculated that a microbe presentation to the two substances might be able to replace one with the other.
"toxic arsenic is mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to that of the phosphorus."
"Accordingly, the agencies were struggling to distinguish these components separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different to that it is not exactly as phosphorus; he got inside, and, somehow, the gum out of our biological machine," explained Anbar.
The researchers found the bacteria known as gfaj-1 and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which she has been able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorous but the fact that he can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic may occur naturally, either on land or on another planet and the Moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; so, researchers have speculated that the first life forms could use it.
This suggests that there may be other ways of life, not just how life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said foster, who was not part of the research team of wolfe-simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs stolen exposure have been found at Compton
The other two dogs of exposure on four stolen from outside a motel in bellflower were found, the sheriffs in Los Angeles County have anoncé Thursday.
The four dogs, two exposure akitas and two Welsh Pembroke corgis - have disappeared Tuesday, when someone stole the van Chevrolet express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 in bellflower, authorities have announced.

"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs were found in the area and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"an investigation is ongoing."
"We do not want to say," whitmore said.
"We are following orders."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were met Wednesday afternoon with their two akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies have discovered the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
The akitas - trace, a male aged 3, and Didi, a female of 10 months - were unharmed, authorities have announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and peek had planned to show regional competitions this week for the Japanese owners of dogs were missing until they were discovered on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in 19 Redding, are in town this weekend in the framework of the championat akc / eukanuba national '"Long Beach, where they intended to present evidence.
Other dogs were expected to participate in other tests prescribed in the days preceding the akc / eukanuba "exposure," said peek at times Wednesday.
The Southern California is one of the rulings of the canine exhibition tour for almost a month.
On Monday evening, peek and Rickard had checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and garent their pickup truck outside, right next to the window of their house.
They took three other dogs - a chiot punch above its weight, a Parson Russell terrier and a épagneul Breton - who stayed with them in the House of the motel.
But they have left the akitas and corgis, the thickest fur in the van when it would be more cost.
They have just opened the windows so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the pickup at 6 p.m. on Tuesday.

It is not clear if a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to be new, the restructuring of GMMs is awaiting the final go-ahead for the Court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, GMM has finally been given the green light to start again from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, has officially acknowledged Thursday the plan "pre-packaged" by creditors that approximately $5 billion of debt would be wiped out, paving the way for the business of entertainment, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and TV programmes.
With the decision on Thursday, according to which the plan satisfies the requirements of the United States Bankruptcy Code, there are no legal obstacles remain before GMM to refloat under the tutelage of the founders of spyglass entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the Directors-General of what will be a studio eased.
The staff will be reduced to approximately 320 on 400 at the outset.
GMM really will not emerge from chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase has not concluded a credit facility of up to $500 million to fund the new operations and productions of GMMs.
It is being distributed under licence by the Investment Bank, which is itself to 75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank moelis & Co. has been hired to advise senior managers on how to put its finances as it did not have the means to pay the interest amounting to 300 million per year.
In August, the General Manager, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in reorganization known for its krispy kreme doughnuts at work.
The attempts of moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of GMMs and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, put the company up for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders including none of them was willing to pay the $2 billion more for the creditors were to research.
In the spring of this year, it was just repeat while the team of GMM had started work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal debate and disagreements, has finally been approved by creditors at the end of October.
When GMM fate officially of bankruptcy in the following weeks, companies moelis and Cooper bonuses of several million for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Businesses of Cooper, who collected $375,000 per month for their leadership of the company, will receive a “success ” of 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account restart production of GMMs, who has emerged as a single film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films being discharged from 2012.
They also intend to co-financing two films based on "The hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan of $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be achieved by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl icahn, who owns about 18 per cent of the debt of GMMs, has tried to achieve a merger of lions gate entertainment with Studio, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Toys Tech gifts to keep your budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is iPad, followed perhaps by the video game system from Microsoft, kinect, the two could make a major breakthrough in your budget gifts.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bmx bicycle and $99 in a game kinect is the same price as 10 classic jumping rope of pearls, or approximately 48 boxes of play-doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, toys "R" us and BJ's wholesale club – to see electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more strength; and cost the same price or a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there is generally less new toys linked to web sites, two of the best-known, webkinz and club Penguin, had more bids.
And toys in button cells are increasing, as well as toys for rechargeable batteries.
A few recommendations.
(All prices are from toys "R" us, unless otherwise noted.)
The sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 pesos for 3 years and older) are toys in the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press on the stomach.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second to compose a song.
If you buy several they chanteront harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you can no longer stop you.
To combine the song to dance, dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 pesos for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Guided by the technology of ELMO live last year, dolls animatronique 14 inches plays games in turn as Simon says, and can make the lunar dance through its innovative articulated feet with wheels.
Children who have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of oversight of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will recall of alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro / playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of cards to play questionnaire designed to transform a balade car in a session with a auto-correction and a binder of valves.
If you are skeptical when your child is your SmartPhone, here are three alternatives.
The mobigo of vtech ($60 for 3 to 8 years) is cheaper and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the Games do not educate as effectively as the explore leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the leapster range, with a screen more recent and more lights.
No version is not compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price ixl of ($90 for 3 to 7 years) system uses a sort of iTunes for games and electronic books and has an entry for SD card that can display photos of the family.
Finally, scrabble flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a box of match, each with its own led screen.
The objective is to train in placing blocks before the time elapses, is ideal for an impromptu spelling competitions.
Increasingly, the toys have a sort of on-line.
On the basis of their presence in the toy stores, the two largest are webkinz and club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet in line of club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 mix 'n' match figure pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years), which includes a room marked a hidden Code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives sufficient appropriations to store Club Penguin for two articles in the choice.
It may be skaters or a pet toy puffle.
Slightly bigger than the NAP after your toothbrushes, hexbug nano ($10 for 5 years and above) is the latest micro-robots button cell.
The false bestiole is moving quickly on 12 silicone pasta alive in random directions.
It is amusing to a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find a way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a drop the kitchen table and even a fleeting passage in the morning after our dog.
Make a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang shenbin arpentait a place of the city as a sergeant in the urban training inspecting its burdens severe nerve, with softly orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of thick ” - Chengguan - responsible for public order in China, feared and hated to their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - send a certain message to a set of spectators.
"you right!"
"be perçantes!"
Show them, he says, "what the beautiful girls!"
Four girls having barely past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and trousers, olive colour figeaient at garde-à-vous.
Four pairs of shoes in black to heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly perched at the top of hair tied in a knot wiped out in blue and white.
"personally, I think they have a seemingly average," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are cute."
More than one Government tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
The city has required that all new recruits have a diploma of higher studies.
Guangdong province has exchanged the gris-vert blue uniforms against a supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux by how high: in 2009, a report indicated that 50 officers had surrounded a trolley to snack uncontrollable with black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur is packing up its affairs and parte.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 million inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to make a large-scale operation of image.
Since 2003, the District has supplemented its police of streets in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their looks, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police dégrossie a softer side, more female.
Unfortunately, even scarlett Johansson may have difficulties in attracting the light on the underground urban brigade of China
And because, critics say.
Unlike the police, they are only permitted to enforce the municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Hubei province have beaten to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film trying to disperse a protest against a landfill waste.
Last year, a manual for the training of inspectors from Beijing, stolen and posted online, outlines how defeat effectively offenders without any blood.
This year, a Shanghai colporteur of watermelons was left with brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A blend of video game violence, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained onslaught street vendors.
"The Government was ” - Chengguan," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy about the tactics.
The journal claimed a "thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say the approach is very far away.
After that the District has spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial published in the Beijing Evening News, was asked whether women had real tasks or whether they were a tourist attractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the district required women candidates, aged between 18 to 22 years old, have a nice Silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They should be larger than the average, or 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The pension for 26 years, is compulsory.
The officials said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"This is the image that is important," said a district officer at rednet.com, a quasi-governmental web site.
"firstly, the quality of external candidates will determine whether they agree; it is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "internal qualities."
Women are like ” - Chengguan flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being the vases, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng lihua, Deputy Director of the Office of Management of the district of the city, do not agree with this description.
But he noted that the requirements concerning the standard were the norm in many Chinese job offers for the two sexes.
Such is the case of the exigeance on the order of facial features.
That means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Indeed, persons with disabilities or changed beyond all recognition should not apply.
"We cannot allow a person or a box bossu come serve here, ” said Mr. Zheng.
"It would not be a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrol the place baoguang near a monastery, is aged 22 and a cheeks with a mouth pommelées finely respect.
It does not consider the development of its appearance as sexist, at-elle said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this?" asked uniform air disillusioned.
Xu Yang, his colleague to fossettes aged 21 years, said: "our job is to convey the image of the city."
They do not oppose that their mandate is limited, they said, because they have bigger ambitions of a career than simply hunting sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen hawkers who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell the more bread rolls or bowls of tofu before escaping.
"master Wang, you should leave."
"We have said several times!", said Ms. Xu, while a seller fled on foot, leaving her to temporarily vélo-charrette noodle.
The agents describe their functions more as monotonous as difficult.
"It is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great."
One of the reasons is that the female workers do not have the power to their male counterparts to confiscate the property of sellers.
They are threatening to report violators to their male superiors.
This is to protect the public exhibitions sudden animosity against bureaucracy that are common across China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread false rumours that ” - Chengguan officers had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police and ” - Chengguan officers were wounded, 14 vehicles from the Government have been overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the Placide baoguang place, where the female officers were patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorbike which was being repaired on the pavement, rather than in a shop, as is required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike cried in the scandal.
A showdown of 15 minutes followed before the police, his face grim, have found a way to shooting elbow into their vehicle and left with the bike and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40 years ago, a coordinator Attaché to the male team stayed behind, his badge white returned to hide his name.
As the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - pure play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain an image cirée.
"sometimes, we fight verbally."
"sometimes, we are fighting physically," said Li said a neutral tone.
"most of the time, it is the public who begins."
Prosecutors did not Senator Ensign inculperont
Prosecutors from the Ministry of Justice have lifted the criminal charges brought on Senator John Ensign, arising out of a case related to an assistant to a former campaign and its efforts to obtain a lobbying work for the husband of the woman, have anoncé Wednesday, lawyers for the senator.
The decision brings to a close the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, republican of Nevada, who was seen as a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and undermine his career.
The Office of Mr. Ensign said he was "very pleased" with the decision, the result of a survey a year ago.
The Senator could still be subject to disciplinary action by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer a subject of the investigation and that it had no intention of maintaining any charges against him in this case."
The Justice Department declined to comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there was significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign allegedly conspired to violate a ban on lobbying federal criminal.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, showed that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in case of Senator with it.
Ms. Hampton once served as Treasurer in a campaign to Ensign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and, secondly, it has defended their rights after they called Mr. Hampton for lobbying for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a friend of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the case, seems inconsistent with the prohibition of so-called revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence, which was made public, "there appears to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate, and substantive violations of the Act of the revolving door," said Stanley brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defense of customers of an investigation by the Government.
Although the judge of the Ministry has refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the Ministry appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks cashed high level by the public integrity section, including the decision last year to abandon the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct proceedings.
Federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking Government officials can now took the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul coggins, lead counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received on Monday a telephone call from the Prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up to the next day, saying that the Ministry did not seek charges against his client.
The team of lawyers for Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the Senator, as his Office reiterated Wednesday, in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law. ”
Mr. coggins refused to specify the legal arguments it had made to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"I am not comfortable to go into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we believe they made the right decision," at-il said.
Last month, the Federal Commission for Elections decided to drop an investigation following a complaint by the independent Ethics Group, arguing that the payment of 96.000 $by the parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV energy, Nevada a large company that has long supported Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company hosted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff to Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, has communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelait" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, allegiant air, and it requested the Secretary of Transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When news of the affair emerged last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his leadership post to rank fourth in the Senate Republican.
Having kept a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was not the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator had hoped that the Ethics Committee quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue its hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
The appeal of Cheshire pointera to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in the process of tapping away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent all the minutes of reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
At the end, the defense has said that there are more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children tied to their beds in a house that had been set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, should lead to a formal end where the judge imposes the death penalty, approved by the Board of Examiners.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes had already file of evidence to the court describing the arguments of appeal to the courts for years.
That is provocative, it is that the intense coverage of the trial — as well as the widespread use and extended by journalists on Twitter — have created "a circus atmosphere," saturation if widespread and instantaneous incendiary details, that the jury had been influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could push the appeals judges to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have made the experience during the trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms, infringes on the Rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge Jon C. Blue State Superior Court, a laconiquement rejected the claims in the judgment last week, saying that the media were "carefully monitored" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
Courts of Appeal shall recognize for decades that media coverage of high-profile cases may raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a judgement of 1966, the United States Supreme Court has overturned the conviction of a ostéopathe Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was an "atmosphere of Carnival at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television broadcast, and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers have said that the court of appeal for review before half a century later, the conviction of Mr. Hayes can be strange given the argument that new rules could be necessary to manage the media from the courtroom, unforeseen at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general right to worry about the impact of new media" in the large-scale trial, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law school who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she had been arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue asserts that some judges of appeal could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instantaneous communication from courtrooms could allow fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is only one among many others described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed during the years; what is delaying the execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered an injury when the judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reaction of potential jurors in their showing photos of macabre crime scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the images of victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48, and her daughters, hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years ago.
Defence lawyers say they will also contest the constitutionality of the death penalty and they will argue that the judge had unjustly expelled one juror, who had been critical to the prosecutors and that he was improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual decision to persuade the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
Jurors have not been hijacked.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge against the verdict, filed last month that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They have maintained that the computer media continued to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The stampede of daily tweets of media cameras and journalists to the Palace of Justice," the lawyers wrote, "do resembled nothing had been seen earlier here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have stated that the assertion that the more incendiary instantaneous news releases issued more slowly, was a much diminished luddiste view that the policy of the Court for the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have said that the appeal courts étaitent often lured by arguments that the social and technological change required an adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insisted on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had overturned the conviction of Dr Sheppard because of media coverage of the trial and they said they invoqueraient need new rules for the new media.
"this case," écrivaient-ils "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility can it bring the divisions?
After a campaign marked by the invective and negativity, a minimum level of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Was this a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation towards the front or a time illusory before the rapid return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress has produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the session of the "lame duck".
But clearly, there was at least a polite discussion of the differences of the two parties, as well as the recognition of their shared responsibility to govern rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score rating vacuum points. item supporter.
The public meeting on Wednesday, the Commission on the deficit, the President has been equally civilized, despite political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a trial period and put to the test in order to obtain evidence of cooperation and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting Tuesday, and the subsequent comments were unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change of the climate that has existed in the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care, or the rights, both parties remain at the mile distance.
However, the November election had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete wehner, a member of the Bush administration, now with the Center for Ethics and public policy.
"It is inevitable after the election.
The elections are partisan passions, and then they estomptent.
That is good. "
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the session of "lame duck", the Republicans and Democrats had no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole of a permanent or temporary basis.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, not least because the Republicans can't afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to workers without jobs.
After the meeting Tuesday at the White House, more optimism hangs on a possible agreement on issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the Covenant "new start".
But William Galston put it, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session "lame duck" ménera does not lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once things that need to be made are, the psychology in the short term will revert to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed widespread scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event in 2012, at-il said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electorate tea who contributed to its establishment.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission of the deficit, which includes reform of the tax code and to increase certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting costs.
The Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have imposed on themselves, the issue of the shortfall on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Committee, composed of 18 members, to make their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group; this suggests that there is on tax matters, at least today, few grounds or willingness to compromise.
Galston put it foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of clashes supporters, given that Republicans challenged Obama on budget, tax and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What is the cause of change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, when the two parties will observe closely the public reaction.
That will be tried in loss should change course and find compromises.
But this would be an optimist.
The partisanship and polarization are higher today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a more ideological difference between Obama and the Republicans in Congress that there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, supporters of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that divide them.
The American documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The town is in the hands of a "kleptocracy ” and moved up to the Kremlin part of bribes and money of protection that it collects, reported to the American Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are reaping enormous racketeering that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only to legitimate businesses but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share money snakes to the top of the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington as Ambassador John beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its web site.
The note is based on sources whose names had been purged.
It was at that time was still Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has since been little traces of cleaning.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Elena batourina, who owns a construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he won a libel trial on those charges.
In September, he told a Russian television channel, where he was questioned about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "This is crazy, it is to build, is anything."
Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report of Embassy; and it is incredible that this would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Government of the city of Moscow and Crime has led some people in the name of "dysfunctional" and to affirm that the Government functioned more as a kleptocracy that a Government ", according to the notes of the Embassy.
"criminal elements enjoy" krysha "(a term used in the criminal world / the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as across the bureaucracy of the Government of the city of Moscow.
"analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world."
"Luzhkov is the Summit."
"the FSB and MVD militias are the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an inefficient system in which the criminal groups fills a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB has more money from big business and that the police are targeting small.
A source, he said, "explained that the Moscow business owners included that it was preferable to obtain protection of the FSB and MVD (rather than organized crime groups), not only because they have more weapons, more resources and more power than the criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law. ”
"that is why the application of protection by the criminal gangs is not so high."
The note said that, although the collection of money should be extended, protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay their cases are rapidly closing under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has referred several times to the fight against corruption, but he admitted that little progress.
The note of the Embassy transmits documents referring to men who make suitcases full of money, probably until the Kremlin.
"in its fight against corruption, Medvedev is bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui satarov, Director of "The indem think tank in Moscow."
"but it is part of the bureaucracy.
"It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia."
Without the policy, without objection, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the indem, costs of corruption would amount to the scale of Russia as a whole, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country has been ranked 154th in a recent poll on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are classified at least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American Embassy, which was achieved yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian Government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to a certain extent, the failures of Moscow, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN's Larry King, Putin has speculated that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the point that U.S. diplomats had disclosed in calling Batman and Robin to Medvedev.
"The problem is the fact that it is our interaction, important factor of domestic policy in this country, he says.
"but to be honest with you, we thought that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to the ethics."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit classroom with barricades decrepit of poor quality, the Director of the secondary school in Anlong Veng referred to the man who had constructed, the last head of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"everyone here love Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and he cared for his people," said Sreng KOR my, aged 42.
Known as "the butcher" for its brutality, when he was the head of the Khmer Rouge commander, remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia where it has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the Organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the Government, the longstanding loyalty is finally challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum truth and reconciliation has enabled victims to respond publicly to people who had participated in the scheme.
In June, the Government has distributed a manual high school, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly conducted with the United Nations, delivered its first award for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, in 35 years, the former head of the notorious torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing khek IEV, better known as "Duch".
In this situation, anxiety has increased among the former Khmer Rouge fighters in Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and their wills to reintegrate in Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said youk Chhang, Director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"for them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the Government of Pol pot-unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here, they have launched an insurgency which lasted until the last movements of a visit in December 1998.
Although Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary ran the guerrillas from their base in the mountains west of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the Government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held Head, was captured by Government forces in 1999 in the Dangrek mountains near.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk in abject poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia; and many of those who remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite officers Khmer Rouge have kept their posts in local leader in exchange for the weapons, it is farmers, unskilled low rank and file.
"These people have received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"they are saturated with the agrarian utopian ideology."
"they were raised in a context where business is an alien concept."
SOR Lim, a 55-year-old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice grower.
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds the world."
But now, life is difficult, because we need to meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused worries here.
The Court should, at the beginning of next year, to begin the trial of Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister Khmer Rouge.
The Tribunal's mandate is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it continued beyond these four cases.
There should be more to calm fears at Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation turned to im chaem, aged 64 years, the former head of district in the Province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she said the researchers of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that it had supervised the construction of the dam of Trapeang thma, a project where thousands of forced labourers were killed.
Recently, on a hot night, im chaem labour returned to the field near her wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road, outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the grass, im dried chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the Court the called, she said, she would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," at-elle said.
"If there was more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the Tribunal had several suspects; although the experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past at-il said.
But dealing with the past is all that Cambodia is to move forward, said youk Chhang, the documentation centre.
"reconciliation in Khmer language is to reconnect the broken pieces, he says.
"We must put the pieces together so that we can understand."
The Centre has produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, "a history of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It was distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details of the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch valeak, age 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng, stated that the new book was helping students understand a large part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book to the home to investigate.
"My family rejects many parts of the Manual and the court", he says.
"they are suspicious because they do not know exactly how many people the Tribunal continue."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation, complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the manual and the Tribunal are beginning to have an impact, at-il said.
However, the Khmer Rouge atrait retain a powerful here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, overrun with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a metal roof rouillée.
The body of Pol Pot was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, aged 31 years ago, sales of mobile phones on the roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated at that location.
"but it was a great spirit; and many people go there to request, she said.
It was the anniversary of nuom sothea, and later that day, she had planned to walk towards the last resting place of Pol Pot, where she would leave a bunch of bananas ripe in the hope of making the chance.
Belarus agrees to give up its stock of weapons-grade uranium.
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; that decision is part of a surprise victory for the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a Security Summit.
The US Government had tried for years to persuade the Belarus from highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached the horizon last spring.
But US officials have told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus in the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research centre of Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the field of about £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, organized at the initiative of Obama; when Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was good to get an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the Summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Summit on Nuclear Safety and Nuclear Security Summit 2012."
"It proves that this process works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership for global security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important step," conducted by Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the United States Government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Nuclear Security Summit of Obama, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, stated that the nation would never turn away from its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of which is essentially to weapons-grade uranium to low-enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"It was our product... we will not manufacture dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone."
"We will use them for research purposes, this is it."
Belarus has brought the United States a few months; however, demonstrating the interest to reach an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October, has been particularly complicated because the equipment had been spent slightly, officials have said.
It was loaded onto a special train has travelled more than 1,300 miles to a plant in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials have said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The US Government spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part, to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"a thorough organization and coordination have been implemented with a view to strengthening confidence", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, an official from the Department of Energy that specialized in reducing the global threat.
According to estimates of the Center for Non-proliferation Studies, James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh suppression by Lukashenko on human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
“While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus were essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has not made any objection to the CIA flights
The Government has not made any objection to the CIA flights with prisoners of Taliban and Al Qaeda in Guantanamo throughout Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the papers sampled (cables) by WikiLeaks in daily El Pais, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Executive is informed Spanish for "pouvoir' demonstrate that they had adequate surveillance on foreign aircraft across Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report which accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, there had been a meeting between the former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Vice-President has acknowledged that the report of the Council "had surprised the Zapatero Government game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"de la Vega emphasized that Spain has no objection in relation to the theft of intelligence by top Spanish territory."
"they want to just be informed" to avoid the "taken aback", describes Aguirre in a cable.
The Ministry of External this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, reported to the Ambassador that the Executive Spanish "wanted to give this matter the profile lowest possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence".
In turn, in January 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez has transmitted to the Embassy that he would not block the judge seeking the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating evidence, any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after having talked with the Prosecutor.
The United States has shown when even their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish and German prosecutors" for information déclassifiée of CNI O of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate efforts to manoeuvre the case quietly between Governments," said Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch meeting between the Ambassador of the United States and the Minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba internal, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are senselessly jealous of its independence and do what they deem appropriate ”, he had instructed his staff" to avoid the comments of hot rhetoric, trying to rebaisser temperature ".
The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the PP in the case.
"despite its general orientation pro-American, our experience suggests that pp certainly will benefit from any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those révélations-là have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," signale-t-elle.
The parricide who went to confession complained in a network of “accablement" of motherhood
The girl spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "terror in the Galician)"
Mónica Fernández is "juanatey muki" in the network.
With the nickname she uses when she was small, communicated with a cousin and a friend; both from Noia, the village of La Coruña where it came from.
The messages dating back to 2008.
To hear them, he must know his romantic life, as ABC built with the help of testimony from his parents.
The Galician girl 30 years had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván túñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they were separated, it was known she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby was at him, but his ex has never been allowed to do the DNA test.
It was discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.

With him, she had lived together for a long time.
César had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to gauge the labour market, the small remained with his partner, who was accompanied by a week in Palma.
But according to the content of its communications means that their idyll is fractured, they are separated.
In March 2008 it was at Minorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is a very strange and annoyed for the fact that I came to work."
"When I told him, it was a good thing, but of course, it is now, what does it mean to be with the child any day and not having the freedom to do what they want".
And then, she spoke of a mobile message that she had just received: 'I want you rentres this month or you give me to address you send the child ".
Ella complains: "if this does not please him, he leaves the young lad with my mother, and I will when I return," allègue-t-elle.

"he will remain with the correct person, i.e. with me, and I will never in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their poor relations.
In July, another post.
When the tape, it is presumed that the child, who came to the island on 1 this month, and he had allegedly been murdered on 10, died.

The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the event had occurred, "and she has no intention to do harm to the minor".

The defence and the prosecution have asked for a psychiatric examination.
The members of the People's Party gained four seats in Congress and the PSC loses 9
With the results of the PP 18-n could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the dramatic increase in votes and deputies in the last elections, the Catalan Autonomous pp has already referred to the general, because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive, as the number of votes that the training received in these comices double normally that it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the Catalans won popular 610.473 votes overall in 2008, while the autonomous of 2006, they had obtained 316.222.
On Sunday, past the PPC has obtained 384.091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, an unwanted diversion of votes of CCS and retention of the electorate of the PP, analysts have calculated that the fact that, while there would be a general election, the PPC could increased from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CIU in would also benefit from four (it now has 10) and PSC loses nothing more nor less than 9 members (it has 25).
These calcules would notice that the place is fundamental for Catalan pp and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular, ERC would lose a Member - he now has three - while COLI was a member or a win.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would be held in May of 2011 for the municipal comices, where people can also be decisive in the end of the Socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in the relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the agencies that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists as the popular are in agreement with the fact that CCS could lose the Mayor of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona, where the Socialists would the majority not the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and COLI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be far-fetched as it loses its representation in the Municipality of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5 per cent for votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital city of Tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared with CCS, including the mayor, Angel Ros, maintained a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
The popular recorded progress also in other important municipes as Badalona, castelldefels or reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan team has helped thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
The seven inmates at Barcelona, in Thailand there had been three
The seven Pakistanis and the Niger citizen detained by agents of the Commissioner General of the Barcelona police formed a jihadist cell, headed from Thailand, facilitates the passports to various groups Al Qaeda, where "the Liberation Tigers of Tamil" Earth (LTTE) and "Laskar e taiba" (Let), the latter being the perpetrator of the Mumbai attacks which have killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal gave great importance to these investigations, to ensure that, with the "operation kampai" has "been debilitated" the falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and therefore, its operative capacity ".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it has been active in Catalonia, have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were forged, and then distributed to groups that joined the Galaxy criminelle Al Qaeda for its "fighters" to cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell dismantled is the only that the jihadist network was operative in Europe, it is for this reason that participated in the investigation, from Thai authorities, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could have the following days of beating similar to that recorded the night of Tuesday, moved to Barcelona.
In coordination with the operation (it has detained Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, atiqur Rehman Malik Asghar jabran Iftikhar Ahmad Mohammed saddique Khan Begum, tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde agunbiade), was held in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan Ehsan butt and Thai sirikanlaya kijbumrung.
It was those who headed for Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan Network - part of which was hit in 2009 - flew mostly tourists passports that satisfied the conditions marked by the appointed "World Islamic Front".
This est-à say the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and codes without visas.
The investigators point out that until now it has not found any details which connects inmates in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, although the author of this attack, "Laskar e taiba," has been a receptor groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before that this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through an agency of a few thousand dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile maps have been used after the intégrants "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police grabbed a abundant documentation.
Pp MAS request to suspend the tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia sánchez-camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to explain personally to Artur MAS its conditions to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those set out during the campaign, which is to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-souverainistes adventures as complicity economic nationalist leader wants to begin the half of its mandate.
The President of the Catalan people arrived to rendezvous with Artur MAS with security that gives the fact of having reached 18 members to the elections on Sunday, more than enough to make love, because the candidate of CIU requires that at least one training that perform the oppositions should refrain in the voting for the inauguration.
A possible agreement with the PP depend the alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that MAS has these days with the rest of political leaders are key in Catalonia.
And the President of the Partido Popular, to support a 'investiture should eliminate all speech and pro-independence advocates' complicity, and economic - similar to that of the Basque country - that the leader converge wants to submit the same to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to thin the political apparatus of an administration autonomique very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas deal from PC, Jordi Cornet and dolors Montserrat.
MAS has met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (QLI) and today it will do so with Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric contends that the deaths were not due to "lack of action".
The owners of the centre of olot did not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse has killed more than 11 elderly
Officials of the geriatric caritat of olot (Gerona yesterday gave a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila dilmé, the nurse who has killed at least eleven elderly for which he was responsible in the meantime that it worked.
The Director of the residence, Joan Sala, was submitted by the Centre's lawyer, Joan cañada and announced that "the desire of the caritat would be able to exercise the charge against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility we must assume the procedural situation of civilians".
And part of the social discrediting the entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the main threat to the caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation as the legal representatives of the victims' relatives calculated already.
Joan Vila dilmé confessed that the first crime date of August 2009 and since that day he has not ceased to kill.
The judge said in the ruling that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients — care the suspicion that, in many cases, no doctor has explored personally died but, given the age and the pathologies of patients, the procedure was done by phone.
The caritat, through its Director, categorically denied yesterday that situation and noted that “the lack of measures may not have been the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of the caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of negligence on the part of any person other than the defendant".
The person already named as the "Angel of death" confessed Monday 11 murders and explained that he has committed his first Crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case it has caused the death by injecting a sobre-dose insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative tablets.
The Director of the caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control access to the staff of the Centre to the medicines.
The injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in its desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying in saying that it has sought for its first victims a death less cruel or otherwise he burned inside, giving the laundry as he has already admitted that he made with the three women killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The caritat does not believe the night nurse, not the number of murders confessed, they cannot eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court of first instance and the lack of logic in the change in how to kill after successfully committed eight murders.
It is for this reason that they say they will remain available for the Court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors have reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday that Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripherals differentials have closed for the Force and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5 per cent.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB to be wrong and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a concern.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way he collapses, he recovered, but motivated by fences and very speculative short positions.
The institutional investor soon to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB gave us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and those who remain.
Bundesbank required the completion of the acquisition plan of public debt because of its inefficiencies and elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that it extends the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintains the quarterly auction for unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity at least until June.
We hope that it will continue with the programme to purchase bonds and you give the signal to intensify.
If they do not carry out the expectations generated, they can turn the excellent market reaction yesterday and they are still blinded to withdraw the measures of liquidity, God help us!
Similarly, during their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and they fail, the markets, history might repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May it announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday, he said he had already bought much, causing a collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year bills in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to $750 million from 4.81% the previous auction.
Even so, types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points across the curve, and reflecting a clear change in market sentiment after the words of Mr Trichet.
In Ireland it was published the figures the hole of allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures represent 10,000 million estimated in the short term and 15,000 potential, and they have a delay until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables in terms of assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government will need to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and there was not yet sufficient support, therefore, Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated its tone to his speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a Union, and that we understand all the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President took the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to boost employment ouïes ring to investors as the Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market suffered the 4.5 per cent, double that of the rest of the European bourses.
That difference in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the effect of surprise.
Today there is a enchère-clé an obligation to three years to be benefited by Trichet, therefore we hope that it will meet with strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For Spain to ask an assistance plan would be a self-immolation.
They provide a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 000 million in cash available, the triple compared to March, types of very expensive and they cut off access to markets indefinitely.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be the wife of Caesar, "in part, the".
Courage, we can get!
The President of the Council clearly eulen Vega Sicilia requested by his son
The storm did not end in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of eulen and El enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, agree, because it considers "one of law", the Judicial Council of El enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and grab the management bodies of the firm Bodegas Vega Sicilia holder.
David Alvarez and his sons David and Jesús María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the Group.
The founder of holding more business services to companies does not appear to be prepared to relinquish its claim to be present in the direction of El enebro.
Its Board has been excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators in the Assembly of shareholders of 18 January this year whose challenge is recorded in the register of trade and societies.
The Judicial Council of El enebro for the next 16, convened by the magistrate commercial number 2 of Madrid, opened the box of tonnerres within the family Álvarez.
The appeal to the judge to determine the Assembly, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism to guarantee the convening of the Assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate remedies of his five sons to try, through a continuation pettifoggery, clearly committing fraud against the law and abusing the law, validate and correct the Assembly essentially null on 18 January," according to his official mouthpieces.
That argument will be the basis for that, once the Assembly has held, is being challenged in recognizing that it is "null and void".
The same players, who has maintained a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate shall convene a meeting in June.
In El enebro, a Property Company and Bodegas Vega Sicilia holder, among other assets, the son of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the Group to seek services, however, the usufruct of 51 per cent of the capital, according to the protocols familiar.
This is the fundamental question that the judge will decide after the hearing on the request of dispute for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon for Siemens
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
When Red Bull es entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this sélecte universe of speed was marked by the surprise and success.
As a first time, nobody has taken into account the options of a new stable, who had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they have all backed the triumph of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as pilot of the champion, German Sebastien vette, the capacity of the Renault engine propelling his car, in the world of Formula 1 it spoke of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens was placed in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful simulation software process that the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with the objectives of the distant automobilistique top-class.
Appointed PLM, this powerful tool technology has been used to create the chains of installation of manufacturing plants throughout the world, of energy, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce faithfully simulating the product or process before the building of a real manner, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of cameras with canon, Sukhoi planes or more famous commercial vehicles for Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the Industrial division of Siemens, said the fact that the use of this technology in its plant in Formula 1 has led Red Bull to create and implement "in few hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team are working today 180 young professionals of high qualifications, with powerful computer equipment to analyse and plan any kind of changes on the bolides.
The leader of the Siemens PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of bolides of Red Bull except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
It amends the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The changes may move the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production, by laser autoclaves and high technology.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the $40 million that each team of Formula 1 can spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has implanted the factory of high technology to create and produce its bolides in a town 50 miles from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
What is happening is considered "top secret".
The staff on duty in 580 people, take two pilots, the champion vettel and mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian vetell.
Among the great technological resources that the mark of energy drinks was placed at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose work is invaluable and zero visibility.
The Director of Technology at the plant, Steve nevey, claims that five years ago, one could say that the progress of R + D in the case of cars racing made the 50 per cent of victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology represents 85 per cent of success, while the pilot make the 15 per cent of the value added.
Nevey admit that both vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP in two years will own 20 shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first store in Barcelona, in collaboration with its exclusive partner bridge Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will enter this initiative with the 16 areas already present in centres multi-brand sales dealer as PC city, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, property of bridge Reyes, with which it was 30 years ago that it works.
The American group has prepared a plan to install 200 branded points of sale in Europe by 2013, a strategy that includes 20 schools in Spain.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona is the third.
Herrero was unwilling to reveal the next possible shops, although she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the placement of shops will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The Group advises American and is the exclusive design furniture stores (with products that may be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe held a similar image.
In addition, HP covers the training of personnel in institutions.
Helena Herrero has denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to clients and PMEs in purchase, assistance, post-vente and even packaging".
The shop in Barcelona includes a space with a pioneering pilot programme at global level that resolves the possible problems of HP computer equipment.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take the same two days."
"the system is designed specifically for users and mpes, because big companies have contracted already technical assistance services," noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet on 'steal' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the Managing Director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war.
Despite this, it provides a breakdown of margins of interests that it will seek to offset partially by increments of committees and the cost of credit.
Sabadell await capture in three years a million customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit future for three years and be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The Bank will set in motion by 2011 a new master plan that will hold a labilité three years ago.
The goal, in part to survive without the need for government subsidies of frob, winning a symbol of market by the capture of a million new customers 700,000 - excluding those who could leave the banque-, its main task, because so far the Bank had ruined the PMEs and societies that the particular customer.
This year he captured 250 000 companies and customers.
Its symbol of individual market is 3.5 per cent, while the companies it exceeds 10 per cent.
Another basis for the period 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or which is the same thing, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, finalize this year its master plan OPTIMA, establishes there is four years, although originally the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further period.
Customers who are escaping the coffers of savings will be his main objective.
During a breakfast organised by apie, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a year of "difficult and" transcendental.
The Executive, in fact, believe that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the business of banking, a insisté-t-il.
And even if he thinks the war liabilities - which penalises the margins — have reduced the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions are paying for its emissions to obtain liquidity move already at the cost of the credit to offset the drop in margins.
"The aspect of the liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not tightened the tap, but differences are highest," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to reduce the long-term credit and increase the price differentials - see cincodías of 22 and 27 November.
He confessed that the tendency of the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The master plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the Group did not eliminate the possibility for corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "will be larger dimensions."
"any move next year", a assuré-t-il.
He claims that the exigencies of capital increase enormously "and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And It mentions that the frob could replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
Having ascertained that Sabadell can survive to the end of time, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already are predicting a new liquidity crisis.
It said that it cannot issue, but on the contrary of what happened in June, you can obtain short-term financing through rest, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the bodies
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and re-emphasized the speed with which perform the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there have been several entities that have assured us that they would not participate in the first phase and they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the General Director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of production of this new wave of operations.
"I believe that the greater part of mergers was conducted, we cannot say that the incorporation of cajasol in the National Bank is a second phase are adjustments."
"most was done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have been made already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has worked very well in this operation," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of executive and leadership of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is "at the highest possible speed and we must be very pleased with how it is achieved within the deadlines that were set in the past, not now, in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain", a emphatisé-t-il.
"the passage of 45 boxes, with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial, unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62 per cent, they are much more important to be consistent with Basel," a souligné-t-il.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a range of opinions quite happy on the slow process" which showed "a lack of sero-status and meaning," because "what the Bank of Spain is to recall that we must respect the time before the end of the year.
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, maintained yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world and it was given to people who doubt a "lack of understanding".
The leader said that given the current economic climate, "We can be very happy" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes with the greatest possible speed".
It was also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has certainly benefited from the stress tests that ECB conducted in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it establishes the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have led to a Government response doble.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which vary from tax cuts for the PMEs, regulation of private agencies for placement or removal of 426 euros in aid to unemployed persons without professional contribution to the privatization of 49 per cent for AENA, the management of Barajas Airport and El Prat and 30 per cent of state lotteries.
For another, the Vice-Chairperson Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, unites the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel in relation to its responsibility to remove the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its forthcoming policy.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there was a dramatic new vision of what should be its future, which shocked with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
The European resistance in Germany are beginning to speculate on the three options out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would abandon the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the mark, even though now it is science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable, almost a 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater control macroeconomic, fiscal discipline, fines on countries that transgress, possible suspension of payments to one of them and extension to the private sector of the potential costs of adjustments.
The German position is clear and that so long as it is now, therefore, there was no room for excuses.
Firstly, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany believed that there should be (plans of fiscal stringency and stability of public finances) and its European partners, France ci-inclut practised.
The second of the Central European countries has been when Merkel has not extended the decision to rescue Greece.
Since then, she has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel reiterates a clear position, calling for the reform of the treaties of the European Union to make possible the rescue of a country and force at the same time the private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has precipitated the crisis in Ireland and the rest.
But his proposal, though somewhat watered down, has been approved, and the following month, we should assist in the process of reform of the Union which makes these measures possible in 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it did not believe pass.
And It said that, although now it must take measures with which it may not be too agree, as of that date, the functioning of the euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the creation of a new monetary zone, in which those who break the rules will be severely punished, they may be required to be declared in default, and in that case, the private sector will also benefit costs.
Germany we said that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances.
An alternative based on debt and the construction, with the huge holes in the balance of payments, which chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not only that the public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What we request is much harder.
And what it does not do in these circumstances is to be deceiving ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence happen to give us greater tranquillity.
And we will seize the opportunity that you have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of the form and its twin statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past on Saturday with large companies and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, it paved the way for the thesis that it be put to the House.
But the red line that Germany has mapped out is, and they do not seem to move.
And among the possibilities envisaged, it cannot exclude that to abandon a monetary zone with too few countries seriously.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that we had warned.
Sport and fraud Act
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion hatched in principle by two players of Real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused much ink on the anti-sportif nature of such behaviour and if both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As you know, a few minutes before closing the game (as their team already earned clear), the two players have deliberately lost the time when they misbehaved to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Given that Real Madrid will be the leader of his group, the two players will use the regulatory sanction during the match next match against auxerre dam and may proceed without boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the Disciplinary Committee of UEFA has punished with two matches, the coach of the team, José mourinho and different economic are the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, rules non-écrites, but followed, this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case reported is the fact that this has been a team player as the entity of Real Madrid, who in his anthem poster nobility and honour and past occasions was sentenced to a fine for his players for similar acts) and dramatization, allegedly orchestrated by mourinho, who adds an episode in its history inflated histrionique technician and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this type of behaviour is not specifically prohibited by the rules contradicted the principles of sport, i.e., whether with these actions it commits a fraud of law; in fact, they are environmentally friendly actions with the sporting regulations, but seemed to sidestep his way.
The issue is to examine the kind of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
The property, which includes a sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that, with these actions had not been put at risk, i.e. there is no violent game.
Another of those assets to which it refers is correct with the game that the team of players from perpetrators of an unjust violation of the team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradox of the action of players from Real Madrid is that it does not accept that there normally characterised as cheating o fraud the law, because its violation of the rules had not been conducted in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has tried to be as clear as possible to receive the criminalization of the arbitrator.
They expected and they gladly accepted the punishment.
Another issue is the type of benefit offenders commit misconduct are investigated.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not in a situation of disadvantage to rival and one receives a benefit in the same match, because obviously the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match, because the club could not count on these players.
Of course the advantage lies in the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cartons that could threaten their future participation in a match.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a degree of ambiguity, because the team could be eliminated and apart from that, with this action, the players are doing a match penalty and spend the second cycle of boxes in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with a less than in the first round.
So, climbing the rungs, this is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is when the same party strategic decisions that promote the maximum advantage that the rules allow.
In our case, the players were not activated to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud the law), M otherwise they chose instead the time in which they were submitted to it.
They took a strategic decision without disrupting the penalty or flee.
Even if the border between genius and fraud the law was diffuse, in this context I think it was a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems, is due to two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and how to transmit to the Director for the cause.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much as ethics, aesthetics.
The offensive offered to pick up the Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar focused this year an avalanche of bookings for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-supporting celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, when December comes back as the dinner of groups before Christmas which continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have lead in an offensive Te cost adjusted to capture mainstream customers: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners, lunches or coincident businessmen and associations in the sector, interviewed.
To complete the complicated accounting, the timing of this year (as night falls on the eve of Friday) has concentrated applications in the week of 13 December, having as a result so far an avalanche of bookings dinners for the days PIC (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees in the plan by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they are the price of battle, confirms the President's gremi restauració de Barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative of the employer, at present, do not dare to predict how will the holidays this month.
"people thinks much before reserve."
"they want to get out, but they are paying a lot of attention to prices," mention.
The case will go well "for those who provide quality at good prices and with a good service", he adds, and recalls that customers have the tendency to take one step with the crisis, so that the group around EUR 25 became the majority in the request.
In a poll in various facilities of the centre there is the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
The Group soteras indicates that there is a genuine boom of requests for responded that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation with complete solutions for 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of powerful, andilana, with 16 schools in the city (hostal of Rita, market, Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar has assumed more advance bookings, even from the start of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes of 19,95 to 30 euros," détaillent-ils.
Year Grup, which includes El mussol ququ, attic, and a total of 23 local, remains optimistic after detected a rise of billing for the second half and, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The sources of the Group indicate that the 18 will also be a day hyper-actif within groups of friends who celebrate ahead of the holidays.
In their six menus of group they added one for Christmas, with EUR 30 or more as budget famous and the perception that there is a willingness to spend another 10 per cent more than last year, instead of requiring more details, like the Catalan wine manufactured according to the method champenoise - cava.
They were also the first signs of improvement in some companies call for new employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
The share of employers fecasarm (which includes such organizations as the Association of bars, restaurants and entertainment de Barcelona), Vice-Chair, Enric gomà, gives the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall bookings are "lively", even if customers up to "negotiate".
This is true, the hope regarding the festival has not fallen, regardless of who pays, indicate.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is a major concern in the United States
Islamabad produced nuclear weapons at a faster pace than that other countries ".
The leaching of WikiLeaks confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of the United States percolates through the portal WikiLeaks confirms the enormous concern in Washington that Pakistan's nuclear programme.
To share the details illuminating and tasty offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the area of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "fading" and that the volatile Asian countries producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program — the fact that weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is as well as Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "the proximity of some nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the spread of nuclear materials including the rumour and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear materials.
The large number of persons involved in the nuclear weapons and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferate and a reason to retain custody.
"Pakistan is hiring staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who worked in the nuclear programmes or missiles," said the expert Yuri Korolyov, outside the Ministry of Russia during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation percolates through the portal of Julian Assange is cooperation increasingly reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the area of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistan nuclear Armas production.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which classifies as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, maintains that: “transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of aid remain unanswered or were eliminated".
In another message, Peter lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, said that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan has nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also calls in Washington, during a visit to the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" that "the army of Pakistan should end with the tacit support of terrorist groups".
The hunting of WikiLeaks
Obama nombrera a high responsible for counter-terrorism in order to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol has a red alert to monitor the movements and locate to Assange.
All the aspects linked to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it datte of 20 November.
And it has nothing to even with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million United States diplomatic documents but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the creator of WikiLeaks lawyer, mark Stephens, provides that “the police knew where and how to contact Mr Assange".
20 The international police headquarters in Lyon (France) has dictated the request of Sweden, but was not made public until yesterday, having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the Interpol 188 countries have received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain provisional arrest and extradition ”.
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanations of the Organization, consider the appeal red notice a clear pathway to arrest --que the national police corps must realize, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is.
The Movement has outraged lawyers to Assange, who yesterday issued a letter dénonceant that WikiLeaks founder of 39 years, has shown willingness to respond by video-conference to questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also point out that Assange has sought and obtained a permit to leave Sweden of the Prosecutor in his case, as compared to the famous Lavrentiy Beria Pavlovich, head of security for Stalin.
"This seems to be a fighter, not a legal persecution", denounces the missive.
While the world seeks — and Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to find itself in an unknown location, but it is silent.
On Monday, he gave at an unknown location, an interview with the Director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that it was responsible for giving orders to graduates épient Americans at the United Nations in violation of the international treaties to which the United States has signed, she should resign," he says.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the Press Secretary in the White House, Robert Gibbs, who has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the request of resignation.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should interest us," a déclaré-t-il for CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a High responsible for counter-terrorism, rusell, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The test of the Spokesman of the President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that politicians and conservative commentators declare these days.
Peter King, the congressiste that from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House has asked the Department of the State that it is exploring the possibility of including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to anyone who provide their contributions or assistance. ”
Yet later went to Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian Chairman Stephen Harper, who has come back from his statements after said that Assange will "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use unmanned aircraft or something similar".
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike huckabee, a Baptist minister and former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"those in the Government who had leaked the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be a punishment too kind", a déclaré-t-il for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with clins at the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will use a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet Executive proposes a more diverse and the end of the system of Assembly.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for solving the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without North because of the loss of 11 members and half the votes.
The party President is aware that its threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time, he knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted that the liar and that absolutely cannot give her headaches that he had with other currents off.
It is for this reason that the leader of Esquerra will win its new criticism with clins glance to shield themselves up in municipal elections.
For a start, puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers to ERC will decide on its continuity in secret.
Through the ballot box, not by raising their hands.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote of penalising the President, they can do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to the person.
In several interviews he said that he would not ratified with more than half the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "at the Bulgarian" would be good.
People close to Carod require the President a little more than put his position at the advocacy level, a gesture that does not apply when puigcercós maxim body control of Congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to accept with the executive a roadmap until May.
For that, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the strategic shift that management will present at the voting of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support puigcercós in exchange for the promise of the scheduling of the Congress for the fall of 2011, what the leaders see as a course.
The leader of ERC has admitted that the "chorus of many" affects the stability and that his goal is to do that once and for all the Organization being able to wash his clothes in the family room.
In this line, the rule that the current Counsellor Josep huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist, the holder of puigcercós innovació had thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if had done.
And he listed five, it emphasizes two.
The first, "mend" the executive to account for at least 90 per cent of the advocacy level, i.e., new figures from the sector Carod follower.
The second may be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the Assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it supports a reform of statute that allows the realization of Congress through delegates elected by the electorate.
The model of Assembly, an exception in the Spanish system, has been an obsession of the puigcercós team, which already has struggled in the last two Congress.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsing the direction of revising the model of Assembly within a specific Congress reform of the regulations.
This meeting remains incomplete, because the national tide of recent years did not address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right for the resume and close forever.

His short message is keeping open a cyber relationship with a document further, which asked the public to immediately contact the senators, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"with a vote that it was hoped soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," signale-t-il.
The message was released after the 42 senators, Republicans have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the funding of the Government continue.
Such a freeze, announced in a letter signed by 41 senators, Republicans could affect the vote of the dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the New START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking the dream Act and other projects, the Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs has said that he is confident that once the fiscal problem is resolved we can fix a AGENDE for the rest of the projects.
"I think it has a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve this fiscal problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time, and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he says.
The leader of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would ask for a vote to close debate "for the dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be passed from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the dream Act or the act of American dream would legalize 800 000 young people who arrived in the United States before age 16, they stayed in this country in the past five years and they have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the army.
But the supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, for which reason they require the participation of a large number of Republicans, in times when the partisan organizations project protagonists intense lobbying to secure the approval of the law.
Democrats, the majority of which support the dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote in a Republican against and only expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for this reason that the supporters of the dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats will vote against the initiative.
Among the most Republicans are courted there, Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, which has supplemented the mandate Su Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have in the past supported the dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said that they would not support another opportunity.
Another Republican who has supported, John McCain, has not defined its position so far.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the greatest obstacles to the dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature it puts its finger on the wound
The second stage of the pleasures of the language was a walk in which participants flaunted storytelling
"sex in the language, I understand that, but... the finger on the wound? that it hoped to me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second phase of the pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and who once used the subtitle of his question (fair during another round table was dedicated to sex in the language, a expliqué-t-elle).
The nail on the head "... we are in a quandary about", started slowly Argentine writer in public, most of the young people, who gathered at the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text devoted to Gonzalo celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a player who wants to know what is the "evil", she went to a doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectiologue it fate convinced: "patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my head".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologue which were cut off by the blast in the middle of the corridor, but it explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyste that reveals the mystery: "The wound is opened in reality, the mark is the scar".
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "on the head I have only been able to know that it is open to reality and that it does not exist", but believes that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be closely interlinked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaragua's Sergio Ramírez made also a lovely story he has entitled paean to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not nombré but at a given moment is discovered.
With overtones of magic realism, he spoke of a famous ensorceleuse which affected the clouds, return of people who had gone or effects of the virtues that damoiselle had lost, a story that turns to talk then America, the news has been from the beginning its own columnists and CITA to Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the excesses of capitans narratives of the conquerors.
"Cervantes who we invented all (writers) mocking false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but a aitre way would never be Conté the history of America with an imagination that lacked even the assault".
However, a souligné-t-il, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the story belongs to a gang or another, where the literary fiction climaxes.
We call this the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his legacy that is what one story".
In turn, the writer Mayra montyero has annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the course with its round table is on the wound.
The cubaine-portoricaine has put hers on the great plague of social violence that his country faces - and the Latin America Division — produced scores of trafique and sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, the good poetry good songs contain a commitment that is not, of course," premeditated indiqué-t-elle, after just the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the engagement between the author and the readers, and that it is a "reaction".
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "this must on the head of the writer committed".
It considered that, in a world which lives in great speed also as regards the intellectual habits and the control of conscience who turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every claim there is a small and behind each denies there was a small yes".
"to be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of reality, we must qualify: and nuance means many times put his finger on the wound and upset the people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in black and white, and ideas without nuance and also upset the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he says, inviting to recover the meaning to write.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey, in the end, there are a further two different styles, which are marked by their technicians, who find them a sharp contrast with the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the final, there have been ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive series, although so far it has not hit the nail on the head, and it is for this reason that this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina has to be content with the sous-champion Medal, he remained a step behind the winners and oddly with the same team he played consecutive final.
The strategist santiste arrived at its first finals as entraineur opening the tournament in 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, in the end 2003 it happened in crucial duel and lost, again with the overall outcome of 3-1 and this was precisely against rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the tournament bicentennial 2010, again against the diablos, Rubén has suffered another setback, because his team has done an equal match to 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the range of penalties he obtained an advantage to 3-1 with two opportunities to win the title and eventually three of its players have missed 11 metres and it has suffered the jump at 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the diablos rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he is trying to move away from maléfice to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I do not want to break no statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I will get the title, but what I have mentioned above is more important," commented on the helmsman when asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers a lot of finals last, which he said that he had learned a lot, "The only lesson we can draw is that until the Umpire siffle the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in line with the players, too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I think this is a lesson before the end of the game we cannot celebrate".
He knows that the series could be defined by penalties, which is not worried, because it gives his players: "it does not get to the range of penalties, trying to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the destiny we made a wrong turn, sometimes it is the emotions or anxiety to keep the title in our hands, hands he has escaped, it served as a lesson to the final and we hope that it does not happen again in this position".
Romano now has the opportunity to be a technician sous-champion and taste for the first time the glory afforded by the titles.

Illegal migration will continue without problem
The draft law of the conservatives who, according to the Government, should address the problem of vessels carrying illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten while the three opposition parties reported Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I relied heavily on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Deputies after the weekly meeting of the Caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to one year, any person from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The bloc Quebecois leader Gilles duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill, because it takes the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we will see what the Government will do," said Mr duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that his party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"The néo-démocrates agreed to take measures against the smuggling of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, the c-35", said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill of the Conservatives because it takes to refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explained Ms. Chow.
The Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused the opposition parties of play to the policy and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians overwhelmingly say to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and who treat the country as a doormat."
"they expect Canada take firm action," responded the Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which would have brought the country to the elections in the event of its rejection.
A conservative has however said the qmi Agency that the Government would request a vote for each Member who oppose is then explains to his constituents.
The new unit does not have unanimous support
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert dutil, argues that this idea is not new: Quebec reportedly visited the Department of Investigation of New York on this subject as early as January.
The Metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement Tuesday, has surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police in Quebec, on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed, despite the presence of Robert dutil.
There was a need for a more critical péquiste in public safety, Stéphane Bergeron (called the announcement "rabbit out of a hat" and "bricolée solution on the corner of a table".
The Minister dutil has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it," contente-t-il said.
"We are aware of this problem."
To the President of the parent, Rejean csq, nothing can replace the setting up of a public inquiry.
"Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to establish this committee of inquiry, most people think like you and me that he has something to hide," explain.
"The only way to have a committee of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains about Yves boisvert, Professor of ethics and governance at the national school of public administration.
To break the impasse, it suggests in Quebec to give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"It must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," solves.
It also believes that Quebec could provide the Auditor with the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent squad is not the only project in the pipeline of Government Charest.
Quebec also seek to Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request from the Prosecutor of the operation hammer, who informed the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, VIC toews, has confirmed that his colleague, justice, rob Nicholson, is currently on certain amendments relating to this issue.
During the spring of 2001, which struck the rider groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adequate, 131 people had been arrested.
Ottawa had subsequently adopted the Law on gangsterism.

The CCNR judge that Mr. Dupont and his team of Choi 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance unduly negative portrayals of Haitians and vulgar language that is not appropriate to be aired during the day".

In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of foul language.
In each case, the broadcaster choi-fm worked "beyond its obligations".

"I started practicing martial arts as the kung-fu and kickboxing there 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in mainland France since 2008 to move among professionals."
"In my case, I was fighting everywhere, as for those who do not like the ground game in mixed martial arts competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, anyone who works as a Security Officer and as committed to the company UPS has just delivered bad news for its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Championships, the World Amateur karate and kickboxing Association (wka) from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.

450 million in contracts without bidding
Hydro-Québec was granted to 450 million in contracts to the engineering firms for the eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts, it is a consortium of companies BPR, Dessau, FS and axor who obtained the most important, that of the management of the project, for a sum of $295 million without bidding.
This consortium called energy management was formed in 2004, concurrent with the choice of Hydro-Québec giving the private sector's responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project in 5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium managing energy décrochait the lucrative contract without there having been to public tender.
For the Party of Quebec, the use of the consortia of enterprises is a serious ethical problem which threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is the new way to collusion and shooting competition."
"It is that people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said yesterday the member péquiste Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue at the National Assembly because, he said, to see how the public interest can be used in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie normandeau, retaliated by afternoon, vigorously denying that there has been collusion to this contract.
"I began to have my trip," she pesté, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and was "deeply flawed".
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of the consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance which allows two or more companies to bring their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The project eastmain has a high level of complexity in view of the magnitude of work.
The project is ongoing and will run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition terms; there have been negotiations.
Also, the formula of the consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week the duty, the formula consortiums in the sector of génie-conseil investigated by the Government.
A quick look at the business register of Québec can count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA + génivar, snc-lavalin and other rock and tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to one and the same entity, Dessau.
The Consortium managing energy normandeau, the Minister stressed that “the territory of James Bay responds to specific dynamic workforce and Hydro-Québec respond in particular since the 1970s".
The big boss of the project eastmain, real LaPorte, the energy company of James Bay (sebj), provided an explanation which has wince on the fact that the contract for project management was granted in OTC.
"If you're going to tender and that there are few bidders, your price will be higher."
"you have two choices: either you take the people who are in even this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price. ”
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people", said Mr. LaPorte.
The contract awarded to the Consortium managing energy is part of a long list of contracts of over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Quebecois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or sebj eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert for the project.
Following verification, the duty were 109 génie-conseil contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, including laboratories of soil.
Snc-lavalin won 22 contracts, génivar had 16, 14 and 10 tecsult Dessau, its participation in managing energy.
All of the contracts were negotiated.
They account for 449 783 344 $, including the contract for energy management of 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard intimated that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, FS and axor) are "well known in Quebec Liberal Party."
The Minister normandeau dropped the PQ is also linked to the firms that "finance", before that it was rather to its leaders.
Consumer barometer responsible - the "green" label does not inspire trust
More Green but frankly sceptical.
The consumer québécois very little confidence to actors for sustainable development, but also fair to marks and qualifications écologisantes to guide its choice.
Worse, even though he lives in a world where the media messages in favour of a more responsible consumption abound, it regrets the lack of credible information, which it called a deficiency of brake on its commitment, said the barometer of responsible consumption, before the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have to increase the consumption of products known as socially responsible Quebecers in 2010, however, seemed to give little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say not believing the environmental performance of companies like green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers questioned the reliability of official certification affixed on the so-called fair products, but also for the credibility of products and brands are posting as environmentally responsible way, said the barometer.
In the same vein, the rhetoric of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
Information about responsible consumption appears essential to stimulate such lively consumption by almost a third of consumers of Quebec.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of information calmeraient the ardour of 46 per cent of consumers.
This is the second obstacle identified by the barometer, after higher prices for these products.
Furthermore, one third of Quebecers are also suspicious alleged performance of green products or services that it seeks to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed to make one or more products to meet their belief.
At the height of 61%, they have also contributed to procurement of traders in their neighborhoods and privileged food grown in their region, said the barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption had reached 64 on a maximum of 100 this year - homo consumus du Québec likes to present itself as the King of recycling, which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint with a concern for the protection of animals.
But its social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside of his car, said the barometer: in 2010, only 28 percent of Quebecers reported having used the transport or encouraged car-pooling to defend their interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1 per cent of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A loan for the purchase of excentris
The Government of Québec, who were asked to make financial commitments for the purchase of the cinema complex excentris by Angus and the parallel, agreed to cooperate, but a loan only.
The development company Angus and the parallel, expecting a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to redeem at Daniel Langlois excentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, restoring full cinéphilique vocation, do not get what they wanted.
The Government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the donation due, the Government of Québec offers a loan which would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution in advantageous conditions, at least in the view of the sources of pharmacies in the State.
A first action plan and a request from 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but complaints have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action had been sent to the Minister ST-PIERRE by the President of the Society for the development of cultural enterprises (macerola SODEC), François, who is leading the case of excentris.
It has submitted a final report it about 10 days ago.
But the counterproposal of office came to the SODEC Tuesday.
The parallel and Angus has until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the gift of the State should be excluded.
Recall that the association of owners of cinemas and Quebec cinéparcs opposes a direct State investment to support the takeover of excentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance housing projects, it has not made for other cinemas.
However, several speakers were of rather significant economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of céans, has over ten years brought up the cinema of author in the premises of the complex after financed its construction, which could justify a derogation from the Council to the Treasury.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting at Montreal and excentris had managed to retain its customers.
The company Angus and the parallel, led by Christian yaccarini, driven, for their part, private funding, hoping to collect $700,000 to push at the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three screens, the parallel, continues to distribute films to excentris.
The aim of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February in projecting the beautiful film of Xavier beauvois men and gods.
But Christian yaccarini has not recalled the duty and that he and his group believed proposals in the fall.
The veil lifted on a Canada complexed...
The new American diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks to lift the veil on what the United States considers the inferiority complex of Canadians with the Americans, but they betray the sense of superiority of recent against Canada.
Thus, American diplomats have expressed astonishment that each elector of Canada has not relations canado-américaines spirit going and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, plastered on the streets yesterday, offer more details croustillants that the substantial content to eat.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, is in full federal election campaign, recounted how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"an inferiority complex of Canada almost inherent makes perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about the daily domestic issues rather than to bring this election in the United States (as in the campaign to free trade in 1988)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, it concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk".
Ambassador understands even less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have close political and economic relationship.
"logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters had in mind go vote."
Another expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing for President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"your trip will help ensure the survival of the Government in the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, for which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a stimulus package of $30 billion to $40 billion," writes Mr breese.
Nowhere does it mention that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being ousted by the coalition and opposition parties made its survival to the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warned Washington image increasingly negative as the drama series broadcast on CBC refer to the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about emissions border, little mosque on the Prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which there is less subtle references to Maher Arar, "or even" no-fly-list kidnapping to CIA interrogations.
Another cable recounted that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some of the prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner has said yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he gave a copy to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to reconsider the matter".
Note finally that tempers are running high on the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on the radio station CBC that the head of this mass flight should be "murdered".
It echoed Mike huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for renovation of the domestic, commercial and light industrial in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which represents almost a third of the additional reduction must be made to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
The ambitious plan is in the wake of major projects that the United Nations hoped to adopt at Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
Under the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs which monopolize yet of 50 to 70 per cent of the market were replaced by fluocompactes bulbs or, better, from light bulbs to light emitting diodes (LEDs or "led" in English), the bulk of the $1.8 billion tons (GT) GHG emissions on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters, such as the US, China, Europe and other countries, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should move the overall GHG emissions of 53 GT to 49 GT.
But it would be exempt from this assessment yet 5 GT in order to stabilize by 2020 the rise of climate change to 2 degrees Celsius to avoid it becoming out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is lost as heat and the rest, or 5 per cent, a product of the light.
With fluocompactes bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75 per cent, and with the new LED bulbs, it reduces the need for energy of two again.
Bulbs fluocompactes lasted an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that launched the Philips manufacturing this week - that society has also participated in the study of the United Nations — have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a smouldering bulb, which gives an idea of the economy with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also operate with rhéostats in addition to emit very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations about the location of fluocompactes bulbs because they contain mercury and that it must be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers are developing instructions.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the bulb fluocompacte, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of Hg per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through the International Programme.
For example, Indonesia and worth $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2 equivalent to 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost $2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire in the nervousness ahead of the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has claimed the publication "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, following the expiry of deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce preliminary results without delay, said a spokesman for the head of the United Nations. ”
“It calls upon all the Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission has missed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing results, three days after the voting on Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the Chairman of the CIS had stated on television that the Commission continues to work "to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS announce the name of the winner of the run-off between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara opponent.
But the Gbagbo camp on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of fraudulent votes "in the north, held by the former rebel forces of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Campaign Director of the Ivorian President, claimed that the intimidation of voters by the Forces nouvelles in the north of the country had discouraged supporters of the outgoing President to vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo are selected by the Constitutional Council.
However opponents of Gbagbo felt that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré as the new, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the North, which denies any link with the former rebels, was deemed "unacceptable" by the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of results, because it knows that it has lost and that a complaint to the Constitutional Council, having prevented the Electoral Commission to disseminate the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was expected to top the reunification and reconciliation process to a country still divided into two for years.
The United Nations has warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of votes to 32 per cent to Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent in the first round).

Case Clotilde Reiss: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held in suspense in France, put the diplomacy on alert, and deepened the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of diplomats from the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by the World below reveal some of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to Americans, going so far as to give them advice for the treatment of their own crises "Hostages" in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman had no counterpart for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the United States for trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place under a harsh spotlight how the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, has played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
A diplomatic cable written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: comments on how to handle cases of hostages."
The Elysée Adviser for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interact with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone.
They explain the French approach.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals used force in Iran.
"made of noise", they say, "martelez constantly" in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"just as the Iranians are asking you not to do so".
Because past attempts to discussions by discreet channels, "the silence will solve nothing," the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics".
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreign nationals is "an Iranian tactic familiar: hostage-taking to political blackmail".
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss, who will speak on 16 August, when it takes refuge in the French Embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians for a large sum of money" (230 million euros in bail).
And he said that the Elysée anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon which "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whom the US demanded the extradition for the illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, as many observers wondered about this unsettling coincidence.
For Washington, which Iranian clandestine networks stalking the acquisition of equipment for the nuclear programme, the expansion of Majid khakavand is bad news.
France has accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian, against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Élysée Palace, he says, has not only been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision ", but has sought to oppose it.
"There has been heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the Attorney General" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government could not reverse the decision," States.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "closely" monitoring of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser has a telephone, clutching, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Élysée Palace has spared no efforts, through press releases and "leaks" in the media, to suggest that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a role "important" and "influential" “Ombudsman ”.
Americans watching this activity without irony, and find that the manipulation to bear fruit as several press articles reflected the French version.
A telegram, dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the official media blitz" French ".
What draws so many "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asked the Embassy in Paris.
"despite their speeches full of praise, French officials acknowledge privately that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then looks at the reasons that led to the Élysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intense outreach effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," that analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and imméritée".
In "exaggerating the role of Syria ”, Paris is seeking to" demonstrate to Syria what praise it can draw in playing a constructive role in the region ".
The aim is also to “sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"but we have thanked anyway."
"this should at least sow confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the Élysée Palace receives.
In a statement, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favour of the release of our own".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a "Cinderella" banning teenagers playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said Government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online gambling to block access to the Games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"many children play these games all night and were then difficult to study at school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said to AFP Jo NIR Ministerial, the officer in charge of the draft law.
Online games will be available at 6 a.m. the following morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The Government also plans to ask companies to limit the time daily access to these games for young people whose parents so request, added the official.
It will also be available to people who have been demanding free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" and newspapers are regularly made various related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world competition online gambling.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World cyber Games, with 58 other nations.
2018-2022: FIFA world means the hosts
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee is Thursday, the hosts of the world cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choices which struggles for influence and lobbying threaten to overshadow the technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 competition Queen of FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional stronghold of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, pays-bas-belgique).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its location in the U.S. or in the Far East, Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons as part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Heads of Government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the challenges of economic and political world.
Backroom negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the evaluation report to FIFA, the Spanish-Portuguese, English (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
But this does not weigh very heavily for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension of corruption from two Members of this reynald temarii (and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, home of football that has hosted the Global only once, in 1966.
The BBC has released a layer, Monday, broadcasting a documentary which identifies three influential members of this, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz, and Issa Hayatou.
What upsetting FIFA and embarrass the English, who are engaged in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the Government hopes to repeat the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won in 2005 for London jo-2012 organization.
This intense activity be enough to restore the image of England from this?
Nothing is less secure since the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack of assets with its stages already prepared, its expertise (mondial-82 in Spain, Barcelona, jo-92 euro-2004 in Portugal) and its culture foot.
But the bleak economic prospects and financial, the two countries could doucher ambitions.
The retaliation against the English and doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal are increasing the symbol of Russia, become an outsider in weight, despite the shortcomings of his file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparations for the vote," in a thinly veiled reference to the accusations of the English press against members of this.
"It covers of mud, trying to undermine", launched by Mr. Putin.
In 2022, the United States, based on the experience of 1994, are seen as the favourites logical.
First world economic power, the headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, who built separately a beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries having co-hosted the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of mondial-2026 to China, eagerly anticipated by FIFA, which would in fact negates the Asian chance for 2022.
With Qatar, who has lifted the great game with futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries have more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from weak TV rights (because of the time difference) by European countries, the sinews of war to FIFA.
Second mandate clearly:
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand was led to believe he was reluctant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A mandate to the Élysée Palace called another.
Therefore, the current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix with the share of mystery attached to the Presidential Office.
Then we must make as if doubt still exists.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, without even believe this, the Friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy was that it would take its decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
It refers to the UMP parliamentary Tuesday evening at the Élysée Palace, the prospect of "two terms" has caused a bit of volatility.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was further.
The President merely point out that the constitutional revision of 2008 restricted to two the number of five.
It was a fact, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that it refers to the presidential elections, in the tone of humour at such gatherings.
"at worst, or at best, you again for seven and a half with me", was launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "do not think that I am not considering the next stage."
His remarks yesterday will not make it more candidate that day; they do not make it less.
If they are the comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination to PS.
But it is not the emergence of Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to disclose.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that many in the PS claim an order of battle earlier than planned.
The bad polls.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46 per cent to 44 per cent, according to bva-l' express).
"We have a candidate, and there was no discussion on this," UMP immediately reacted cautiously and around the Prime Minister.
"if he believes the defeat, it will not be a candidate", by Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"We were always able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: forced the ECB to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities of crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of unconventional monetary policy which must be achèver at the end of the year.
Sovereign debt crisis obliges the European emission Institute of Frankfurt will probably not afford to be so bold as to aggravate a situation more tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost could be especially high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the debt crisis of States in Europe.
She declined to say whether she believed that the Central Bank should do more, such as increasing its programme to purchase sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my reflection in my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown more information about its intentions, merely indicate that the programme of buying government securities in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
One certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the European Central Bank have doubled last week, nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of securities Irish and Portuguese, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the marketers, expectations of further purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect significant change of course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still unlimited allowances in cash on generous and for periods from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that the scheme to be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it significantly alters its programme".
"otherwise it would be taking the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more probable" anticipates Meanwhile Norbert bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the government debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of these obligations to enliven a sluggish market," said Norbert bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposure to the markets of sovereign debt in the euro zone, the issue has no other choice than to maintain its presence in the market.
"It is a substitute for the lack of investors on the market and act so as to prevent a runaway returns paid on the most fragile states," reflected an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are soaring, States will be more constrained to reduce their debt, if not stabilize.
The protection of the euro is the price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi Government made the back round
After a worrying week for Italy, the situation is a little more relaxed, yesterday, with the return of bond rate in 10 years.
A return to calm volatile.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of the economy, the Presidents of the region said they had heard Giulio Tremonti called the situation "indecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable", as he was then denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the peak of 210 basis points and the award of contracts to hedge against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, triggering a panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has pointed out that in Spain, the gap with the German rate was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by the "turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third euro zone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of growth and weaker tax revenues that goes with them, leaving the State to run the risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels was a cold shower for the Government.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1 per cent in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate respectively on table 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent.
In these circumstances, the European Commission, the public deficit will represent yet 4.3 per cent of GDP next year, compared with 3.9 per cent forecast by the Government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumour of a new budget that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"if necessary, new austerity measures will be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"the fundamentals of the economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, provides the Administrator of Italy at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, either in the short or long term, because despite its substantial debt (119.2 percent of GDP in 2011, ndlr), stabilization efforts made in Italy are lower than those made in other countries," said Pier Carlo padoan, Chief Economist at the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi takes a no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held in late March.
Then a period would not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has again stressed yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it has demonstrated yet again Sunday in the day and into the night, are clearly interlinked, determined, pledged to defend their currencies and monetary zone."
Although a relative, détente recorded yesterday on the European government bonds has played right into the hands of the Governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of an early normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it might downgrade of Portugal's debt, the target the most targeted today by speculation.
"as in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on the banking system," said economists at exane BNP Paribas.
As the policy is much slower than the time of markets ".
Aware of this gap and dangers that it holds, the European countries to intensify discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis mechanisms already exist.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers of the G20.
In view also of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support countries in the euro zone in the sights of markets (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore, a tour of Asia to inform the far eastern investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly the field.
The first of the EFSF are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, a US official has told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of IMF.
The frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, is preparing to adopt structural reforms, including in terms of organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which are in addition to the austerity measures to effect more closely.
Lisbon and Madrid want to follow a different path than those of Greece and Ireland.
Either take to avoid to request international assistance before setting up their own budgetary adjustments and decide the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
The European donors, finally, talk on the available options for accelerating the process of standardization of sovereign bond markets.
In Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber had first floated the idea that if the €750 billion raised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to call out to the portfolio.
Economists from Barclays Capital, a prominent player in the market for European sovereign debt, consider that an extension of some 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of cash.
The vehicle is there: it is the European financial stabilisation mechanism, to date, EUR 60 billion.
A Council which was likely to be examined carefully in European capitals.
Especially if the market festered.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange vigilance
The episodes, snow caused difficulties of movement, including on the secondary network in Britain, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert because of the risk of snow and ice.
The EURE, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in vigilance Orange, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to weather France, supported by snow showers in the north of the Gironde and Charente snow and low on the Ile-de-France.
The layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, on time of 7 to 10 cm are expected for the departments concerned, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, ribs of Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne of Poitou and those regions of Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The episodes are sufficiently significant snow to cause difficulties of movement and disrupt certain economic activities, warns weather France.
In the ribs of Armor, several departments have been forbidden to lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, axes and guingamp-lannion saint-brieuc-loudéac.
Traffic on the network in Britain is very difficult, according to the gendarmes who recommend not to take his vehicle in case of need and the movement of some cars ter was suspended for the day.
School transport has been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles.
The Prefecture "invites all motorists to be careful on the roads and to adapt their behaviour accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) asked the airlines to cancel Thursday, 25 percent of their flights at Paris airport Roissy and 10 per cent to Orly because of snow to come.
DGAC recommends that air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport south of London and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Paris subway large financial ones.
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions rained down.
In the discussion.
It referred in particular to 23 billion for the subway grand Paris that must build the company of the great Paris.
To jump-start the GSP, the State announced a capital funding of EUR 4 billion.
In the conceptual design, it is this that will then enable the SGP to borrow on the markets share in the financing of its dual buckle.
Today, it is finally in the early 1800s.
Amending Finance Act of 2010, considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms to find the beginning of that money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax plan and a tax increase on the offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, do we mention in the text of the draft Law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the society of the great Paris".
She said: "the proceeds of this tax is $117 million euros per year".
The second is a reworking of a tax on existing offices "to modernize, to increase the output and the increase in the company of the great Paris".
It would do that?
Mystery.
This is not costed in the text.
It is far from the 4 billion.
"It is clear that these tax resources in addition to the €4 billion of equity capital to be mobilized by the State and the society of the great Paris as" project, we read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP, we do not find this shocking.
"once we established revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), it can cover the studies over three years and then tapping in the 4 billion after," explained.
"This will be included in the budget and fired as".
The SGP is estimated that 4 billion would begin to be enrolled in 2013 to 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still on hold, may cause a parliamentary debate somewhat turbulent.
The first public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers and spies in revenge
The case of Wikileaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it is a scandal, a scandal which appears as scandal before the hypocrisy which governs relations between States, the people and the press.
On the other hand, it announced sweeping changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the downturn.
But are in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each case constituted by a secret service (any) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The American "extraordinary" revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and the profile of the typical eerily Gaddafi was long for artists to cabaret skits.
The rule that the secret files must be that new compounds already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a bookshop in esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeat (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of the rennes-le-château templiers or rose-croix) exactly what was written in the earlier books.
And not just because the author of hidden texts do not make new research (or knows where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those involved in the occultisme believe that they know already, and reconfirms what they had learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy (or mind limited) the head of the secret services, otherwise it could be, whatever, editor of Libération), who does as true as it recognizes.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome was sending to the Department of State were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these dossiers have made so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that any person embraced already know, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since that heads of States can telephone or take a plane to meet for dinner, lost their diplomatic service and, with the exception of a few small representation, exercises have become centres of espionage.
Any viewer of films of inquiry knows this, and it is only by hypocrisy that it pretends to ignore.
However, the fact of the publicly reiterate violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the secrets any more secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the Department of State.
As the scandal did not as being in crisis victims that the "torturers".
But now to the very nature of what happened.
Once, at the time of Orwell, one could conceive of any power as a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was fully proved since that can monitor each movement through telephone calls, each transaction, the hotel visited, the motorway from and so forth, the citizen becomes the victim of the eye of power.
But when it shows, as it is now, that even the secret cryptes power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the monitoring report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen, vindictive, can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that is not allowed to retain its own secrets can it hold?
It is true, said George Simmel, a true secret ballot is a secret (and secret vacuum can never be unveiled); it is true, too, that know everything about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a secret secret vacuum, because in the public domain; but reveal, as WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secret means removing any power.
Wikileaks has done no wrong to Sarkozy and Merkel, but was too large to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful?
It is clear that in the future, States can no longer put them online any information given - it would publish it on a poster I round the corner.
But it is equally clear that with current technology, it is vain hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing could be easier than to discover if and when a Head of State travelled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in future reports and reserved?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction sounds like science fiction and is romantic, but I am obliged to imagine Government officials who move quietly in efforts to control routes, with carriers that messages learned by heart or, at most, by hiding the scarce information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in a single copy in locked boxes: basically, the attempted espionage of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has reintroduced a telegram on son (by telephone).
The videos (analogue) had allowed the researchers to explore a cinema film, moving forwards and backwards and removing all the secrets of installation, whereas now the CD (digital) do that skip chapter by chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, it goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the air, and it includes displacement, it is three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not unusual for the policy and the communications technology back to cars on horseback.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what is going on in the secret embassies.
At present, there are embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France bidouille its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of promises of funding disbursed (so-called fast start and early funding) made by the developed countries.
And the big bidouillages French are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France 1.26 billion euros ($420 million).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has lifted the great game to persuade its partners of the reality of his commitment to funding fast start: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, great side event, distribution of leaflets...
The operation transparency is welcome and appreciated: developing countries and civil society like that all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announcement have emerged in 2010 to 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on the way to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is achieved without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means to "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
The European Commission has, for example, seen as a reference to the year 2009: international funding are maintained, and it adds $150 million over three years to the fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the funding of all "new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years or the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of support from France to developing countries can remain stable or even declining), to uphold its commitment in terms of funding "new and additional"...
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that €1 provided amounts to €1.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recouped as equivalent to a euro that... at the most, should not be counted under its commitments that the cost of the loan to the lender (equivalent to a rate of interest).
But France did that make such an argument: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million in making 91.5 per cent of loans ($389.8 million euros) and 8.5 per cent of grants (36.1 million euros) - see document from the EU to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the EU to use if massively the loan.
Germany is required to 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (other) to fulfil their commitments with 100 percent of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is €1 to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick!
In summary, in its financing fast start, France operates a double scam: the evolution of the action in time and the reality of the financial effort.
By not spending that 36.1 million euros, she came to believe that she spends $420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it is Bercy that has achieved the Arbitration) could have a double impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give it enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely stupid...
The chapter of early funding is only a small matter, relatively short term, compared to the overall debate on the climate.
But there may be a grain of sand in the vast machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
Nevertheless, it is essential to draw lessons from the first year of funding early.
First, France could announce a change in the accounting treatment for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move the discussion on issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): It will not escape the "additionality" or the accounting treatment of loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as on others.
The hope is thus based on the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who arrives in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase international confidence necessary to move forward in discussions.
Warning to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child involved in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association generations (former movement for rights and respect of future generations).
The Association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", purchased between July and September the commonly consumed foods and one in four meals a day when a child of a dozen years in supermarkets the Oise and Paris.
These meals types, including the official recommendations - five fruit and vegetables, dairy products and three 1.5 litres of water per day, as well as sweets, were reviewed by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the tax base is damning: 81 of which 42 are chemicals that are carcinogenic and five possible or probable carcinogenic substances classified as well as some 37 substances that act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or PE is worrying," said the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea to milk alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proved as carcinogens some as well as nearly a dozen residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, defined by the study, when this traces of six with a fungicide chemical substances banned in France.
Same thing for the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak chopped canned tuna, and even the baton of bread and such as selling chewing gum were littered with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For the dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the plastic base used to warm the meals in the microwave was not free.
The final risk to the consumer of cocktails "spiked" is probably underestimated, "according to the study.
The Alliance Europe ecologie-les Greens (ee-lv), for its part, has proposed "faced with the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop the increase in diseases of civilisation ".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides found in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
