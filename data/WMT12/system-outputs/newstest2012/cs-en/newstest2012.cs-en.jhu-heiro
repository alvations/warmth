Ukraine's parliament today rejected a proposal to cancel in the amendment of the Penal Code Section, on the basis of which were sentenced opposition leader, Yuliya Tymoshenko.

Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebélie, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried at an unknown location in the desert and without it after the war.
To determine the winners.
As is usual in the region, wins the elections, but it is about the question of whether moderate or radical Islamists.
The National Transitional Council has signed up to zvykovému Sharia law and we have some idea about it.
Libya has become a country without crime, as for theft, seká hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, potential apostates from faith are awaiting execution, and so on.
Instead of a person's company consisting of rival tribes will integrate the Koran.
In Libya will order, what we can imagine and that we certainly do not want.
But our way of life is not only or objectively the best and most likely would be for change did not meet required just mentioned by the Libyans.
In fact, it is a wonder that Islamic fighters took gets help from the infidels dogs principles.
Excuses for it is only that, in their view, neřídil NATO air strikes a general from America, but aláh, whose size in any povedeném celebrated intervention.
So, when the winners are in Libya, the West is not among them.
We have been to shootings, served the Islam and our politicians in the shape of the dictator of political allies, without this guarantee some making.
After the military neokupujeme fresh bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya.
A problem with the expulsion of "křižáků local lapses."
But without the occupation of the oil companies will have to hubičku Libyan black gold?
The West may not be enough and so will finally be able to boast of disinterested protection of human rights.
So if we nepřekazí those supporters of Sharia law.
Is entering a new era of crisis.

Children's diets obézního: nesnídá and dinner hams
More than a third of children under the age of 9 to 13 years have problems with overweight, and excess weight is 9 per cent of schoolchildren and obese is 5 per cent of children.
Obese children, mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey has shown.
It shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which grows, and role models, which is surrounded by.
On the desks in obese children, there are, for example, sell up to half of the more than in the families of children with normal weight.
Potato hranolky have for dinner the day before research associated with obesity awareness events, it is no coincidence more than 19 percent of the obese.
In tlouštíků also is not the norm sportovat families, but which, for most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children said that their parents at least once a week to find time for an active movement.
Survey of 900 children
Survey took place at the end of last school year, and took part nearly 900 children from the primary school in the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the actions of the obesity is no accident, which supports universal health insurance and a company Unilever.
So far, the project involved more than 12 thousand schoolchildren from 4 to 8 classes.
Diet and a lack of movement in the family, however, is one of the defining factors that causes even dramatically increasing the number of children are overweight or obese.
"Only half of the respondents said that her five times a day in the snídaně-svačina-oběd-svačina-večeře regime, for example, which is one of the basic assumptions of a healthy diet," is one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and evening uzenina
Experts warn that are essential for healthy development, as well as the relative family snídaní details, one of which is to be the regular time.
In the Czech Republic while at the same time eating breakfast only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren.
In most families, eating breakfast every man.
And the worst was the finding that the household in the desetině nesnídá at all.
Breakfast is right at the same time, the daily diet.
A questionnaire showed that obese children in families with more often eat unhealthy hranolky.
Almost everyone - regardless of the weight of drink - fresh every day limonády - 70 per cent.
While regularly sportuje more than 40 percent of the children for their parents, the result was less than half - 15 per cent.
Sestav their diet
Another part of the survey to selected children - 172 204 boys and girls from 13 schools - form of offered the possibility of their own diets, according to their own tastes and his own opinion.
"Eating preferences of Czech children under the age of 12 to 15 years are far from the point of view of a healthy diet to the ideal."
Among their popular jídly is a lot moučných, masitých and sladkých cooking.
"It is particularly alarming the popularity of sladkých limonád," says in the final report on the survey.
To obědu as the main food won pasta both just over poultry.
Children but it is virtually nothing wanted pulses and low popularity of fish and poledních zeleninových meals.
Attachment to health
At the same time poll showed that children are willing their eating habits to, if they get the right information.
"in control of the survey participants, who vyplňovali questionnaire for the educational courses obesity is no accident, it is in many cases a significant shift in the direction of the principles of healthy eating preferences," says the project.
Striking was the case, for example, with sladkých limonád more children, where they started to prefer the ordinary water.
Children also zaškrtly more frequently in the questionnaire poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would reduce sweet food and knedlíky.
Stylista must also be good psychologist, says the profíci
In the initial article on how they learn stylisté, so I am a little postěžovala, this has already been a lot in the early hours.
This is what I netušila what will follow.
Lecture three profíků from the field, oblékání problematic figures, as well as seminar on how it is on hold.
And it will be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information, as well as practical tasks ahead of us.
Held every Saturday and Sunday, and even if the rate is really "našlapaný."
This time we are with the director of the alenkou probíraly in the exchange rate is not the only boy, as pay woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And such is the overwhelming majority.
Someone has a short neck, one was chlapeckou figure without pořádných křivek and someone, being overweight.
Stylista procedures must know how zjemnit extend broad shoulders, neck or add the curves.
We got off, as for the wife of Jennifer lopezové, more PRSA and Boky and narrow, stress and, at the same time, the woman neobléknout figure much too vyzývavě passport.
If, for example, there is a difference between the passport and Boky that skirts or trousers really out of character, then it makes sense to keep ušít at least one such piece on peace.
Certainly you will not regret it, because it is perfectly padnoucí clothes to nezaplacení.
In skirt on peace, you will feel much better than in the one that you are constantly shifting, vyhrnuje odstává those and so on.
Chlapecká character, can afford to wear clothes with řasením applications, výšivkami or nabíráním.
Such information and the types of figures is, of course, a lot, so I am glad that I have a whole week to have all the information on this utřídila in my head.
And fear is that, because it is up to zadanému domestic task.
Each of the kurzistek, received přiřazenou celebritu, which has come up with two outfity: daily and evening.
We must take into account the appearance, the fashionable style of the personality and the type of characters.
I will be "dress" mirandu kerrovou, perhaps you know it from Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of jásám, for me personally, certainly better than that Britney spearsová, Christina Aguilera, which in recent times přibrala perhaps 100 one kilogram of - please take into account nadsázku - or mladinká Selena gomezová.
Oblečky must avoid from magazines or out on the Internet and vytisknout and then graphically process.
Moodboard, as will the result, says that, as well as our personal style and relationship to grafickému ztvárnění.
Think a graphic side of stylingu is important, too.
Stylista is neobléká just physically, but also creates the product pages in magazines, for example - to a specific project, for example, the trends of handbags, of convenience, etc..
Tell us about that stylista and návrhář Mario kameník.
But this only on Sunday.
Stylista must have a general overview
Saturday a lecture nabitou information about the kinds of figures zpestřili now three guests from the field.
Stylista John humble, fashion návrhář Jakub polanka and fashion photographer Ben renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and stylista, should be used.
And šikovný stylista can work with one piece of clothing in a variety of ways.
Variabilita is crucial in this case.
We should be a trenčkot - or if you want trenchcoat initially, it is possible to be standard across the džíny and Triko as cover, but it can pay for the bare body, on the road lodičky and nafotit as a dress.
Or just roll rukávy or límce and now the look is different.
"The play a," stressed about it.
But I most appreciate the following advice: "You need to work perfectly aware of the rules."
"Then you can begin to break," he said Jakub.
Finally, it is so clear to me why the drtíme all those propositions, what with the combined, to what, why, when and in fashion magazines Sometimes we see something else.
Not to mention the přehlídkách.
Thanks to the fotografovi benovi, I know that stylista must have prepared a lot more options clothes than they fotit.
So in fashion story, which will have 10 parties, 10 outfitů, I have to be ready to "nastajlovat" at least 15.
And also that looks and works in combination with other pieces at fotce clothes sometimes very different than in reality.
With that, so we have to create a outfitu count.
That image and style is doing, sometimes up to half the success we confirmed John humble.
You only have to look at the madonnu image and marketing, which is not a miracle zpěvačkou, but make it a world star.
In the Czech republic is still approach to the use of services stylistů rather cold.
As well as familiar faces, it sometimes as unnecessary - just did something that I can, that, as in vypadám is secondary.
And if they are from the US people leave a styling, then we have expected that we nadiktuje likely to completely different - smaller size than it really is.
Then left to googlovat and to see whether the tabloid nepsal about the fact that the celebrita ztoustla / zhubla and the like.
John and Mario put us on Sunday to lead the heart, that is not enough stylistovi is in vogue and outfit to cobbled together.
Above all, communicate with people in their work, which also putting on, and so it is important to be a good psychologem.
To estimate the people nepodbízet, the State for his point of view.
"When you objedná any manažerka, it protřídili šatník and added it to fine pieces, so it can not vyházet a skříň and say, for God's sake, this is the horror."
'find at least a couple of things that pochválíte there and Will you encourage, for what they wear, "says Mario.
It also specifically showed us what it must include a "placovka ', or the Taška on Plac.
It is the one zapnete around the passport and you are in possession of all the necessary propriety.
In addition to the clear things, such as the gap, váleček chlupy or zavírací pin factor, there are also silonová thread with it stylista vypomáhá in focení products, such as handbags and hats, special klipsy, which sepneme behind the clothes, if there is a greater špendlík or other svorka are not admissible, destroyed the dress, or šitíčko.
In order to just neposlouchaly, but also something virtually vyzkoušely, we learn, as well podlepit shoes.
And in the ateliéru where there is equal focení surface, podrážka could harm, let alone outside.
And so we lepily and lepily.
Nůžkami shoes we must not affect that happens to damage.
Is there a need to really zručnost.
Mario pleased with me when my creation of the unqualified praise.
The zručnost, is not really my kámoška.
Each this is only a tiny fraction of what we listen on the second a continuation of the course.
Begins to be becoming more and more clear to me that a commitment to stylingu on the professional level is really not a walk in the park, regardless of whether they say who wants what it wants.
In a Need for Speed: the run with Závodí across America.
A review
Originally a ride is quite unnecessary on sloppy mistakes because of a series of changes in routine morning trip to šichtu.
Ambitions to have, to a large extent, but this is not a valid, when clearly nechtělo anyone to do anything more.
The run he appeared before issuing a new deal with the high expectations.
Promised that years of Race Series Need for Speed once again take a new direction, and of the hratelných highlights seemed like the game in žánru action involved, which would not only be in number.
We were also curious, as will the passages in which the hero will be deployed from and will take place after their cars.
But as it is customary for a series of NFS, many is in effect a little differently than we expected.
It is potentially a decent arkádové, but a whole stretches down a few unnecessary errors, which are more or less in a series of for several years.
So it is that they are not even the mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible laziness of the vývojářů.
Adventure is very well.
You are included in the story, which the hero Jack has Some problems of personal character and as a solution offers participation in illegal race across America.
At the wheel usednete on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is dorazit as it is the first in New York.
The idea brings with it some interesting elements.
Route is divided into 10 stages, and then to more than 50 plants.
The implication is that every race goes on the other line, and the stage is set in various different enough and interesting environment.
One that does not have a moment, a feeling that it still offered the same game.
Moreover, some of the environment are very nice to see, even though the technical level of works of grafiky corresponds to the previous series.
So it is no světoborného.
But ride across the desert landscape, the autumn or in the zasněžených high mountains are vizuálně very pleasantly.
Plants are also from time to time zpestřeny some netypickým element.
IN THE DESERT, for example, přimotáte into sandy storms, which greatly reduces visibility.
By contrast, in the mountains, you must be careful not to make you nezasypala avalanche.
In addition, they are well behind nasázeny individual race.
While there are only a few types, but it is enough.
Point, so you předjet the required number of rivals in the essence of the classic race, then, doháníte time - classic battle with the stopkami - and then are waiting for you to be duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, even in this připlete, as well as the police, which all your efforts are making. difficult even further
What are those outside the car.
Rather it is just such an interactive animace, when Jack prchá majority before someone and you must help him so that, in the right moments tisknete right buttons.
Nothing complex.
Surprise, however, that these passages in the game is much less than you expect - perhaps even only three in particular.
As a result, but it is a good thing because the element has a chance to become otravným and in the context of this grows, so one of the elements that zpestřují game.
Driving model is following in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that in this day and age, it is definitely not kdovíco, but one can not say that it would be záporem.
If you are looking for from realistic simulating,, you will have to look elsewhere.
But akčněji pojatému involved driving model suits here still quite well in the competition, although we could find better.
So far, all well and good.
But the problems are starting to emerge after a period of time.
In contrast to jízdního model, is no longer power in order kolizní model.
From the Games of this type, that we spočítá difficult distortions and collisions, but when in fact to any nárazem into any building you have your car will do, then it is probably the least suspect, as everything in order.
Typically in close předjíždění or míjení cars in normal operation, sometimes only a little olíznete each other, but sometimes in almost identical situation will end your car in the wild piruetách.
Or even a napadrť.
Thanks to the restartů system that is not particularly does not matter, but it rozladí you reliably.
Restarty are handled in such a way that if the rozmlátíte or vyjedete far out of line, way back on the last game you a clue on the track.
But only five restartů is available in every race.
When the race vyčerpáte, you have to start again from the beginning.
So it is that AIDS, in case something goes wrong, rather than that you can explicitly rely on them.
But sometimes even restarty will not help to solve it is to the need to learn the section of the race by heart.
A neduhem Games is that often the same thing happening in the same places.
Some zatáčky so it is necessary to drive in a specific way, for example, or it will simply nevejdete in them.
At other times, one sees around on the ground "civilian" there are always in the same configuration whether you go first, pátí sooner, by five seconds or a minute later.
Naštve especially in situations where you can see how easily between the two protijedoucími cars opponent before you projede, while there dojedete you, vehicles are already in a position that is to objíždět or přibrzdit.
Is one that dojedete to them, because it is "so that the situation was" spočítáno always just before your eyes.
Rivals also have another advantage.
For all the time playing you in a few places, where, once again, regardless of the time, you always předjede the same opponent in the same place.
Most praští at the end of the game on a bridge, where you go in the protisměru.
Opponent to get there before You must clearly not at any price.
If it is in front of you, so you are getting worse picture of the protijedoucích cars, so there was some rozmašírujete had much.
Can we do understand the game napínavější and adrenalinovější, but it is so obvious that you carry out a reliable znechutí quickly.
And it is a pity, because despite the simple driving model is fun and gaming, and the action, so much so that sometimes literally nestíháte monitor, where what lítá.
And it is in this is actually one of whether to credit concept with padesátkou unikátních lines, řazení plants, so that nuda did not have a chance, or anything else.
Atypical idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You must be careful about gasoline Pumpy for journeys, because that is where you can change the car, while the vast majority of cases, the vystačíte with what it is you are.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporťáky are appropriate to urban areas, strong American bouráky equal highways and exotic supersporty on technical eco-driving, for example, after the klikatých mountain roads.
Goes hand in hand with the příběhovým regime and mode of challenges, which are a lokacích individual, of which you are aware of the story.
Here you are given not only the medals, but also zkušenostní points in their profile, which is common to the challenges of the story.
To obtain a higher level of drivers odemykají different subjects, ranging from cars to pozadími for profile.
It is linked to the online autolog functions, which among other things is again at the same time, your achievements with other players and the obstarává another community functions.
One of the other, obscure kopanců is the situation of the last race in the story.
With her, then you get into a tunnel underground is, where the ženete in the dark on the tracks - so be it.
On the tachometru you blikají figures between 150 and 200 km / h - is - and this in turn zezadu přiřítí souprava metro and uncompromising sešrotuje you.
In the Bureau and perhaps even us for a couple of days last debate on whether, in the creation of the game, in fact, not even a little bit nepřemýšlel or whether the authors are really having so much for us blbce.
Technical aspect of the game is nothing extra, but at least the visual impression is very pleasant and in some cases, even the Great in most cases.
Zamrzí so that, in some vypjatějších moments in it, and in some cases quite tragically.
But it is, above all, bouraček with larger numbers of participants, Where would you replaced it was no longer just of no avail.
Zvuková site is in order, and soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to attract the widest variety of younger audience is soundtrack rather different from the category of "Every dog together," but it can be assumed that, for listening to music, the game will not only about as someone to buy.
Overall impression of the Need for Speed: the run is a puzzlement.
If the game vyvarovala completely unnecessary errors, then we nebáli say that it is the best part of NFS run over the past few years.
But this game is nedodělaně.
Entertainment, this is definitely a fine, but be prepared to force that you will třískat mistakes in the eyes of spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativistů and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty quite significantly disrupt the balance between the various institutions."
"I did not expect it will be a tough war."
"will take five, six years before the situation a bit will be frozen, settle down and before we all players becomes natural in his new role," began tough their paper on the legal the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena faculty vicenová.
As its motto "clearly and openly about Europe" takes seriously, has already shown in the first part of a lecture, as it has been described by the authorities of the EU and their relations so transparent and clear way, many lecturers from the law department of the UK that it might envy.
Vicenová also commend the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"First appear more criticism, that it is a modest, that this is šedý official that he could not have any role to play, and I have to say that all the vyrazilo breath, that the role of the tackled well."
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, it to communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, explained as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union which telephone number I call??," so as an important step to unite and greater readability EU policy towards countries, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us syrečky
Vicenová is on the agenda, too, lived by the European Council, is alive and will live in the near term.
Předloňské the Czech Presidency as a success.
The Czechs with emerging financial crisis, solving the crisis of the gas or organised for the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The fall of the government in this time, then called for a liability, which the Czech Republic very heavily damaged.
Czech representation in the EU now has a very napilno.
In the words of ambassador, "The frmol" was not just the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still.
Moreover, has yet to approve a new seven-year EU budget, which is very complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and the austerity budget, which will receive priority sector, which countries will be paid more and less, all of this is on the agenda of the forthcoming negotiations.
Ambassador recalled, as well as its main slogans, which came in Brussels: "clearly" on Europe.
"I would really have no ugly ',' foreign words, hantýrku that no one understands.
In Brussels as a citizen to understand that, really, nevymýšlejí zakřivené or big cucumbers, bananas, various large and or that anyone really needs to ban us syrečky.. "
Also wants to make better use of EU environment and get more Czechs to European institutions.
We have more speed Europe
According to the Ambassador of Czechs have reputation of Eurosceptics and people who have those negative attention rather than the positive aspects of the things.
In addition to regret it low representation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
This is due to many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, according to her then their inability to write letters, but low support from the Czech parties as well.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, underlined the strength and cooperation visegradské Quartet.
"Believe me, that when it comes to me a Pole and a Hungarian and close to the slovák, this french says:" hele next to me, as scházíte there, what was it your visegradská Quartet? "and then enthusiastically on this at all."
Union in the future, according to vicenové are mainly new tough rules for budgetary policies of member countries.
As Europe's very real, sees the concept of a two speed, if not more speed, rather than a new "European federation."
"There are countries in the euro area and the countries outside the euro area."
"We have the potential of Schengen, we already have, as well as the enhanced cooperation."
'work has been told for the first time only countries which want to, and those that do n't want, let stand idly by. "
"Those measures will be a Europe more and it will be a hard," is expected to vicenová.
In this regard, also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principles under which the to discuss all the issues that have an impact on the whole of the Union, among all the Member States, not only between the countries of the euro area.

For the general public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution is that the company viewed as a very current, and yet from its inception, it was 100 years ago.
Basis of this dlouhodobosti laid the first chairman of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He no longer razil slogan, that many of the world's problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think about.
His motto, "Think!" is so otiskem, around which will take on the life of a future giant - and also the name of the internal magazine, which, in IBM, based in 1935.
The Watson was carefully built corporate culture.
"For us long term thinking of IBM means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survive and prosper 100 years due to the fact that remain true to its basic values and at the same time, the nebála changing everything else around them.
This dovolilo us during our first centuries to transform the technology, business and society.
We hope that we will manage to achieve even more in the second hundred that, "remarked on the anniversary of the Director Samuel J. Palmisano companies.
A system
Watson in the 1930s, taken to care for their employees, as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM had as one of the first American employees paid leave, insurance from employers plus elegant staff uniform and a system to pay the best inventors and businessmen.
Just a has IBM over the long term, as well as the relationship with the client.
Society has been since the beginning of the exploitation of the talent - as one of the first of the world's companies, any kind of discrimination, so they can choose.
The current plan, in line with the strategy of anti-discrimination is that, led by IBM in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia rometty.
Those working in IBM for 30 years, still holds the position šéfky sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM makes the jamy online brainstormingy in recent years, many of which the future strategy and innovation.
It is no wonder that ideas are enough - nearly half a million people working in the company.
Institutions with a good name
Strong position in the business of providing for its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM concept institutions rather than just economistu technology companies," said Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of books on the IBM rosabeth moss kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but firm, which helps deal with George colony byznysové problems for the use of technology," he added of the consultation Forrester research firm.
As the company itself, says there is a difference between the straight to come on the market and the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue," as it is in the United States because of its logu familiérně dubbed - for a hundred years, grew up in one of the world's largest companies.
Is probably nejvšestrannější technology company - is the hardware and software, infrasturukturu hosting and consultation services in a variety of products from servers to nanotechnology.
Holding most patents from all the US technology companies and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.
Between its inventions are to be brought, payment card, financial swap, a bar code or disketa.
IBM is roughly $220 billion dollars this year, has become the second largest technology company by market capitalization - the first is apple - Microsoft overtook, when for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovation trefily into consumer tastes and time - for example, IBM nepovedla bet on its own operating system from / 2, online services prodigy or IBM computers pcjr.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you can not be emotionally focus on the past," poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano.
This is why IBM does not have a problem to build its foundations on many platforms - and leave when do not work, that is.
The difference to competition from Microsoft, which in principle it hinges on the Windows operating system.
Fit technology
IBM in sales, the biggest contribution involved services for around a fifth are software and hardware.
Yet in 1990, with more than half the proportion was the strongest representative of the hardware.
Since 2000, IBM sold few profitable assets worth $15 billion dollars, has invested $58 billion during the same period in the purchase of technology.
In investment continues, as well as from 2008, when the first swept modern world financial crisis.
IBM is according to the legacy of its first leader, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the amount of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is untouched by the crisis.
The stock price of IBM has risen by rocket 120 per cent since the beginning of 2008, the net profit of the company continually rising.
IBM corporate motto is to change everything, not just their values.
We can therefore expect that, even when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant it survives.
IBM's history: from kráječe cheeses for flights into space
IBM - International Business Machines - originated in New York a hundred years ago, initially had complicated the computing tabulating recording Corporation.
Name of IBM took up in 1924 - it was originally a brand used for arms companies in Canada and South America.
Basis for IBM later gave the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
Hold the technology so as to be famous, "píchačky" hours of running zaměstnancův arrival and departure.
Architect of the new firm was byznysmen Charles ranlett Flint, which by 1930 also chaired the Advisory Council of the company.
Flint should Thomas J. Watson, head of the competitive companies to help with the management of the company.
Leader then were overshadowed by the founder of IBM - on watsonových ideas is still built invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the Company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, starting with the production and sale of all sorts of machinery for business - from kráječů meat and cheese to Treasury.
During the first four years ago, Watson, for years, headed to double turnover on the nine million dollars and has extensive expansion of the firms in all continents.
Watson was so vital for business, that almost after 40 years in the šéfovském seat it has been replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM has begun work on the development of artificial intelligence, has developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, helped NASA and computers from IBM to manage flights into space - on the Merkur, Saturn and the famous years man on the moon in 1969.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - a number of IBM System / 360.
Classic "pécéčko" that has brought about a computer, called the IBM 5150 standard then came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years on IBM sold the production of computers, Lenovo Chinese companies, on the other hand, konzultantskou purchased part of the firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to take the advice and services with high added value.
IBM pays strategy, which, in the last three years - is the concept of smarter planets, "smarter planet."
Its aim is still to be even neplánovaných smart use of technology in areas of transport and improve the situation, for example, or urban management.
For the trade has recently IBM platform "smarter commerce helps manage the business cycle," which traders.
IBM also has a strong history in the home.
Its pobočku already established in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932, as in the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
In addition to IBM's here today has also strategic outsourcing centre in Brně.
Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague, and there is also a world class research team dealing with the rozpoznáváním voice.
Rychtářová on nevěrném Bedroom:
Iveto, Oslo, will leave it, I do not want it now!
Darina rychtářová - 53 - said the end!
After her husband of Joseph rychtáře - 53 - has become not only a ivety bartošové 45, but also milenec Darina still hoped that Joseph of pink dream wakes up and return home.
But now wait is going, and into the next life set clear rules.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner," explained rychtářová.
When Darina rychtářová granted asylum bartošové in their house in the summer, it will probably not away, as their marriage will end at the end of the day.
Yet, Iveta on its insistence after 30 days of říčan that moved, Pepa zpěvačku neopustil.
Even publicly admitted that he loves it.
Darina resigned over time, with the relationship her husband, ostensibly has become reconciled and now even gave him goodbye forever.
Rychytáře interest, with whom his wife sleep
If rychtář with bartošovou, after all, only one rozešel it open embrace may wives will not wait at home.
"is the biological father of my sons and if it is going to be my life in our common home, no one will not force it."
"to him, however, not as my beloved, zbloudilý old osel, but as a man with whom I have some ties," have told the rychtářová with the fact that since the husband odpoutala and insists on a mutual respect.
Josefovi, that he Darina back Vrata closing, never mind yet.
"decisions wife respect."
"With ivetou I am and I am not going to change."
"Wife has set the paper of marriage, and I respect that."
"firm goes further, starám on corrections, the garden, the property, nakupuji."
"With the darinou talk completely normal, just that, together, we do not share a bed," he said blesku rychtář.
If rychtářová also found a new love, will not hinder it, in this.
"nespíme together, and I do not care where it is, with whom it is and whether he is a friend of mine.
I know that it is my fault, and I zamiloval in ivety and I take all the responsibility of ourselves, "by Joseph.
The worst of the female vices: relate to you?
If you ask men whether they would be able to name a typical female vices, usually all in one is very swiftly vysypou from arsenal.
Ladies, you will see in the next řádcích men, where it says some bad female habits that can perfectly rozpumpovat in cold blood?
Shopping
Vyčítá your second polovička you, that you are dependent on buying?
You will have on themselves to buy at least one hadřík per week?
Would you buy something and in the slevách en masse?
Then, in your case, one can talk about buying as a habit.
Some of the women are aware that their nakupovatelskou passion should at least a little tame.
But say that they would resist it, just go after the shops with the oblečením, look at themselves well padnoucí svršky and then have it all - ideally in different color provedeních - try in the kabince?
Even if it is for the majority of women buying koníčkem for men may be literally total hell.
Just think how many times you have to say, whether they will wait for you before the door...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not tlustá power?"
"needed to lose weight at least five one kilogram of - I should start exercising?"
"líbím those at all?"
Not resembling something you this sentence?
It?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not, be that you should stop for themselves, but a lot of men alergická directly on how their partner constantly complain about their appearance.
Stronger gender also agree on the fact that the frequency of this stěžování increases, the women are otravnější.
Order and purity in the first place
It is like an endless kolotoč.
Washing windows, hoovering-up vytírání dlažby, utírání dust, drhnutí vany - and at least twice a week.
Vyčítáte partner, that have stepped on dirty feet to clean dlažbu, children, that zašpinily vydrhnuté umyvadlo and opatlaly prosklenou obývací wall, with which leštěním you have so much work?
In the event that you suffer precisely this "aberration," Try to realise that nothing is not overstate and order and purity definitely should not be in the family in the first place.
This benign desire for purity, may threaten your family mutual relations and wellbeing.
Rýpání
"They used trenýrky cast in the bin."
"The old ones ponožky you to take it tomorrow?"
"mokrá utěrka, have no place on earth."
If such rýpete several times a day to its partner, vězte, that it can reliably vytočit.
That, of course, do you not think no bad, surely you want to ensure that everything was in order.
Perhaps, if the men knew that, women would not now so much in them rýpat...
Maligning, drbání
For defamation, gossip, but also some of the women are their own, as well as insulting and conspiracy against someone.
Women are focused on the relationship, and so, like school matters like the who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us a little harmless DRB or klevetu here will launch there.
In all honesty, it is perhaps all the women of their own.
But opposite are drbny most brutal kind, which like and often drbají perhaps every flout and its surroundings - especially in the women's professional team - particularly dangerous.

As the tour have prices since 1989
In 1989 in what was then Czechoslovakia was only allowed five of travel agents: Čedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autoturist.
Travel agents at the time, sold only in the most trips to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the West, was very limited.
Czech tourists travel to leave to the sea in the GDR German Democratic Republic, to the Soviet Union Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea, to Bulgaria, Romania - both to the Black Sea - and in Hungary - Balaton.
Positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, then, however, the Yugoslav regime embrace to the west and the way of the Czech tourists in Yugoslavia, have been very limited.
The ultimate irony, socialism was that citizens of the Socialist bloc - i.e. also čechoslovákům - not been allowed to travel individually or as part of the socialist countries.
I would, in the event that Czechoslovakia individual citizen to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, has not been so needed in this country zvací letter or individual way possible.
Travel agents offering trips to the West, but at the time it was necessary to stand overnight spacákem or have in the front office "well known."
NOT SO, however, was not vyhráno.
The FX Promise, which was a condition for the trip to the West, was granted a "politically nespolehlivým people" who could not travel at all.
Czechoslovakia's currency is not freely směnitelnou currency without any exchange promise has not been able to obtain financial resources - Western currency - on the road to the west.
By far the most often, however, the Czechs take holidays at home, which were a large number of chat and chalup, which the Czechs pořizovali and this custom survives to this day.
Travel since 1989, the Czechs and experienced a real revolution.
Whereas in 1989 was leave our a maximum in the GDR or Bulgaria, spent last year the Czechs 4.5 m holidays abroad in countries around the world.
Huge paradox, which we are not already aware, it is, in fact, that was not possible in 1989 for us in today's most popular travel freely, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Immediately in the early 1990s, the abolition of visa requirements in the neighbouring West European countries, which was triggered by a huge wave of short visits Austria Vienna or Germany in particular.
čechoslováci, could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone is there for a long time I would look at least for a moment.
They were in Paris sleeping trips, for example, the Czechs in parks in tents, as our revenue nedovolovaly then, so that we can pay the hotel or penzion.
A typical feature of travel was the Czechs in this time of vození own food banks, salámů, etc., in order to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible, the Czech koruna and our tourists can finally, after many destítkách years to buy western currency.
Our standard of living, and with it the average pay rise, however, which resulted in around 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, a travel agent prepare trips charterovými air spoji regularly since 1997, and the air trips due to the possibility of nasmlouvat quantitative sales in comparison with the past incredibly had become cheaper.
In the late 1990's they already had the Czechs visa waiver to virtually all advanced countries in the world, apart from the US, which continues to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of a post-revolutionary travel came right back in 2000, when he was due to the significant demand vypraven from the Czech Republic, the first ever direct charterový years in the exotiky, it was in Thailand.
From this year, and every year vylétávají with Czech tourists chartery direct to teplých distant lands, already this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic in the twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic country visit currently has around 100 thousand Czechs per year!
Another interesting point in this period, which stands for our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
 17 November 2008 removed the US visas for Czech tourists and that our country definitively, among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, as well as the Czechs for the first time in the history of spent more than half of their holidays abroad - 50,3% - and for the first time in the history of it spent on a foreign holiday, including the costs of the whereabouts of more than 15 tis. Kč per person.
Most of it is to find the president once again but there is stalemate
Almost five months is the Czech football without a President and there is a risk that Ivan haška successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic fačr - wo n't be known for another extraordinary general pile, which will take place on Thursday in the nymburce.
Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral law will proceed.
Without it, or begins to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interested lead Czech football are Jindřich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomas paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June, and in his retirement urged colleagues to get together and find a strong personality, leading football in the future.
But in an era of football after haškovi sklouzl back to infighting between the two svazovými Commerce, which can not agree on a common candidate.
There are shown on 16 September, when it should be the new President of the selected.
Delegates of the into the National Home in Prague on smíchově sjeli unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained stalled and was not just a way of elections.
There is not a consensus, who actually has the right to a vote - if the only statutory representatives, or even the officials the full power.
In the only point a partial agreement since then, helped by the Constitution and the right for the state, in which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are disputes but still on the electoral law.
Did too much clarity to the situation did introduce or executive committee, which has already in their negotiations, whether regular or emergency, not in fact, nothing else.
Look at the possibility of elections has changed several times, but neuralgický point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round in order to rule out the possibility of a stalemate?
"Controversy is whether to be in line with the statutes or find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents fačr Dusan freedom, which represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model wins in the third round, one of the candidates, which will have a greater percentage of support in the House, FOR WHICH IS running.
Morava is said to be prepared to go to the concession, that won the candidate who gets higher cost per cent of the votes in both chambers.
And the Czech side on condition that the winner in this procentuálním population must be given at least a two-thirds dominance.
"But it would then pozbývala sense the two previous rounds, it would be totally Office denied bicameral concept," understands the objections Moravské party freedom, which would have been the best of law neohýbat and vote according to current guidelines.
Somewhat surprisingly agrees with this, as well as Tomas paclík, although it is estimated that the statutes for election law suits peltovi most of all the candidates.
"I wish to decide upon the maximum under statutes."
"In order to nevymýšlely Any substitute nonsense as the pile of the past," said owner Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and vymezoval primarily against the peltovi in their comments.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In nymburce according to him, the new president will be known, and believe that the candidates to work constructively together will be in the future.
"All the passions reassures the possible today's procedure of the national team at the European Championship."
"Football, it will be up to a wave, means there will be more willing to cooperate," jablonecký leader myself, which has experience with the management of the three biggest football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is restrained.
"I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very conflicted."
"It is not from the Czech and moravy among people, but there are Focused efforts to adapt to the rules."
"That can cause it, that will be blokaci General of once again."
"But I hope that common sense will prevail," he said rajchl.
The agreement of all parties, there is a lot of time.
Some of the negotiations would have to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether to match will be the soccer generalita complete at all.
Airline speciál, in which should travel to podgorice Vice-Presidents, among other things Dalibor Kučera and rajchl, from Prague due to a technical neodletěl disorder morning and look for alternative option, as part of the Executive Committee of the theatres barážové retribution ship.
Perhaps in the end will be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, to which can be reported on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and tělovýchovy Joseph Dobeš would like to persuade divided parties within the sports associations in the country to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football, as well as in most of the čstv that will deal with the new direction of the Czech sport after financial problems sazky.
Paclík goes into the fight on the President, because they get the right candidate
If the players Plzně Tomas paclík a particular saw much of a strong candidate to meet all his ideas for a new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic fačr response - or would have to fight for the post.
"If the quality of the adept existed, and the election of nejdu bojuju for it."
"But in the current situation, find none of these failed," he said ČTK paclík.
In the contest with Miroslav peltou and jindřichem rajchlem drives paclíka motivation to just peltovi alleged favoritovi elections, tried to avoid in the way of the fačr.
Paclík also points out that in the case of his victory, in the role of President of survived only until 2013, when it is on the agenda of the General a good.
As prospective would like to see experienced and excellence manager who is not too linked to the football events.
"with some of the people who would come into consideration, I am talking."
"For me It was crazy, though some said that, at this point, with the Czech football or do not want to identify."
"Such a view, I would like to change," he said.
Paclíkovi, now most of all with peltovo links with President plzeňského regional football union Romano berbrem man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes, known as powerful a lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting delegates on the pile.
For paclíka is unacceptable, so that pelta came to the position.
"If he won, so zakonzervuje the status quo and nothing would be in football's ahead."
"in combination with the support of berbra, which is zdatným trader football, it would be even more," said paclík.
Faces that peltovo name said in odposleších years ago in investigating the corruption affair, which, however, pelta left without punishment.
"I do not know what the prestige of football peltovo victory would deliver."
"And how we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," he said paclík, but he has also takes with grace its former statement that it would sell Plzeňský club, "if the pelta became president."
In the event that it paclík in Thursday's vote triumfoval, but with peltou could imagine the future cooperation.
Another candidate, is rajchl, which paclík supported before the zářijovou much of which ended in fiasco.
"he - pelta - would be the first for whom he would like to go."
"My great ability."
"Could I imagine him to be as a team."
"But manažersky would follow the association failed."
"I also nestrkám nose, where I ca n't," he said paclík, which in September raised a great deal of attention to the fact that behind the cancellation of the Commission rozhodčích led by luďkem macelou, which replaced the Dagmar damková.
Paclík argues that the leadership of the Association troufl.
Refers to its capacity of the management of private companies, also heads Plzni since last summer, which celebrated premiérový with his support in May ligový triumph.
"I have the power to ensure that something has changed in the football environment, to contribute to a growing."
"to limit the effects of certain interest groups that need to tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which goes to the nechutných situation," he said paclík, who made no secret of his antipathy to sparťanskému boss, for example, Daniel křetínskému immense.
As one of the priorities would also found the tightening of fačr relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help, for political leaders lobbied for it to be in the sport received more money from loterijní tax.
"This is one of the key things that should be the new president to address."
"If there is a taxing hazard to declare political parties, so I understand their reasoning, but on the table to say where the money goes," said.
As a burden now paclík takes or its link with plzeňským club, though he says that the President of fačr should be "bipartisan."
Pelta, meanwhile, is associated with jabloncem rajchl with the Prague duklou.
"It is not ideal."
"But I do not see or sense in someone clinging to převáděl their shares in the plzeňském club and there was a year and a half," he said paclík.
Pelta promised new fačr, which would have excluded the electoral stalemate
Two days before the vast piles of Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency of Miroslav pelta promised that if elected, will fačr new guidelines to be definitively excluded the disputes over the election law, which would be in the future.
Jablonecký funkcionář is ahead of Thursday's negotiations in the nymburce optimistic and believes that the election battle, say the success of the football team today.
Pelta even before the zářijovou neuskutečněnou choice has promised that if elected to concentrate on entertainment and obtaining financing.
In elections before the last large piles of decided to go at the last minute, and with two delay can throw him, so that his views on the management of football defend and presented in a broader context.
"People at all levels of football for a long time and do expect that, on Thursday, will be chairman of the unknown."
"Someone feels that it is high time that the association had," is the man who is particularly associated with the jabloneckým club, but who for many years served in the spartě and the Union's executive committee.
And, therefore, believes that the Czech football has enough experience to be able to manage.
Is convinced that the current problems with the election of euphoria, which was at the time the government is Ivan haška.
"Unfortunately the pile of statutes, which was approved in June was not as perfect as we all thought."
"If we had nepřipouštěly different interpretations, president since September," pelta pointed out.
It is the most important document as a vějičku civic associations pojal delegátům.
"If the tent as president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to bring personal responsibility, if it is not."
"It is a matter of principle, without which we can not be," says the pelta.
Further, trying to nevymezovat against their rivals.
Avizoval before, that they can see cooperation with jindřichem rajchlem, which recognises the because of his právnickému education, and his by the candidate opposing knows perfectly well that would be his first vice president.
Long neútočil or on the national paclíka, who, on the other hand, the peltovi left the thread dry.
"In football there are little more than a year, has already received some successes."
"His attacks, however, were indecent and a lot of people in a way zaskočil electoral campaign."
"Because many of them are now doubts about its true nature," he said protivníkovu the pelta, which it said is committed to proclamations, which had already announced in September.
His strongest weapon is a knowledge of football to him from the competition to representation.
The site should be skříní football.
"And I would also like to end all affair, starting with kauzou Bohemians or ECHO of last year's scope scandal discretionary."
"NATO would like to vrhnul immediately to negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure enough money for the whole of football," he said ČTK šestačtyřicetiletý candidate two months ago.
At the time also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personnel cleansing.
"Well, I would have, first of all, to individual employees' say on Strahov, where there is understandable anxiety from the long anarchy.

Europe's most beautiful pools
Leap into the blue
Julia stanek
Brouzdaliště from the point of view ufona, přepychový bazén in Budapest: Who can see Travel Europe, its blue miracle - and after the body search of cities or travel to their tired legs break in termálních lázních.
Knížka show, where wellness in water is the most beautiful.
When they make iris meder could in the past one and a half year objevné roads, in her luggage missing: her swimsuits.
Ležíc naznak on water, vzhlížela to amount to umělecky utvářených kopulí, plavala, mramorovým putti - postavám small nahého boy, of the child - with arms - that it expected on the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restaurované secesní plovárny.
If some of the plovárna fancy it, damaged in an zanesla it into their zápisníku - even with notable details about the way the building and history of the buildings.
More than 200 plováren reviews in this way historička meder architecture and is now in his just released book "badefreuden joy of bathing ': the People's plovárny in Munich, the historic palace plováren in schwarzwaldu in taunusu" hard core of concrete buildings. "
13 countries it led the way for nejneobyčejnějšími "lázněmi in Central Europe": In addition to attend sites in Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-letá a German is the real entuziastkou plovárenské culture.
This power nepřehání, says meder - only to sport in the water it is something else.
The anger is just that fandové swimming must be content with blue kachličkami and causes congestion chlóru, while běžci for health can vdechovat omamnou vůni smrkových forests or listen to the veselému švitoření birds in the park.
"One day, I ask, why do plovárny must always be so šeredné," Ms meder says living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect the fine plovárny."
Water levels zdvojuje architecture
šplouchání in skokanském pool and atmospheric oil for saunu comfort factor - it is so great that applies to all the senses, so much the meder.
And when the founding fathers worked, can be plovárny real pastvou for eyes everywhere: "rather than our floors one is in lázních water level."
"It is both transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the building."
Everything is optically zdvojuje: high klenba, to kachle skokanská planks.
Maloformátový obrázkový relationship "badefreuden joy of bathing 'provides to 190 pages, what we need to know all the architectural and cultural history of historical havens wellnes - raises but, above all, taste it plunge into the modři.
Remarkable of a sběratelka plováren Mrs meder in their search in Hungary.
Alongside the wonderful of spa, as 100 years old spa Széchenyi found water with the content of nitrates in Budapest, in the original krasové jeskyni - jeskynní's spas in the miskolc-tapolca and thermal's spas, whose pools are the alkalickou water and are located in the shape of the bottle, városi termálfürdö in jászberény.
Wonderful spectacle, by contrast, offer many of the vytápěné plovárny in the open air in Switzerland and Austria. What one has so far from the curyšského nástřešního koupaliště in the eyes of the entire city, in May of the pool spa in St Anton to see snow pokrytý Arlberg - and, in parních lázních is a window from which it is possible to see tourism on the ski sjezdovce.
Perhaps the most striking design the pool is expected to lázeňské guests in längenfeldu: akvapark ötztal looks like UFO, which has just landed in the Alps.
Of the three up open cooking steam rises in winter so far, as in the mountains ötztalu ční to heaven.
Alhambra in schwarzwaldu
Not in any plovárně rose sběratelce bazénů Mrs meder pach chlóru in chřípí.
Many thermal's spas are feeling after the síře, in lázních Árpád in the Hungarian békescsabě stinks to topném oil to the extent that you hardly believe that got into medical spa.
Stench from medicinal waters with content alkalických hydrogenuhličitanů, which is almost black, whose usazeniny ulpívají on skin, when only one vklouzne into the pool - a strange experience wellness.
But also one place was Iris meder in his quest for fine spa disappointed: when I visit the Czech solar and climate's spas Luhačovice confronted at a closed terrain.
In 1902 architect of the dušanem jurkovičem proposed's spas have been closed in the meantime.
When the meder look collapsing windows červeno-bílo-žluté secesní buildings, uviděla, as is growing weeds between dlaždicemi.
Failure to stand up in the magic, by contrast, plovárně in schwarzwaldu: in Palais thermal in bad wildbad.
These's spas have already had a three stage construction; one can occur only novorománské elements in the 1844, which come from the days of its creation, but also maurskou hall in the style of Alhambra, which were added around the 1900.
From careful modernisation of the 1995 is Palais thermal popular lázeňským place znalkyně bazénů Mrs iris meder, and not only because of the schwarzwaldu comes from.
"It is a performance to such a diverse construction slohy in a beautiful complex," says the meder.
On such a palace ponoření in termálního the pool is probably a relatively minor issue.
An agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank is to trade in commodities
Christian teevs
Leaves Deutsche Bank of trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to the information spiegel-online has appointed Joseph Ackermann working group to investigate the effects of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, to draw the consequences of the concern.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the thing is clear: 84% of Germans, according to a study to be unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of those even demand that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions from this trade came because of the problems of the poorest of the world is.
This is the result of consumer organisations also forsa there from the foodwatch.
Study is based on the report, which foodwatch establishing itself in the middle of October.
In that it shows the author of Harald Schumann, bets on global commodity exchanges is driving the price to a height and banks are therefore complicit in the global problem of hunger.
Consumer campaign defenders is directed specifically against the boss of Deutsche Bank josefu ackermannovi, while also velkobanky such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting like.
Commodity bets was originally meant to traders to cover themselves against price volatility.
Meanwhile, but most experts agree that the capital market interest in the highly risky trades break with the supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest make profits.
Other than competitors in the United States responded to the criticism of the Ackermann: to criticisms will test, and said that no trade "is for this to be a good reputation of Deutsche Bank held up at risk."
According to the Spiegel online controls the International Working Group of the criticisms of the foodwatch-report.
By the end of the year, control is to be closed, then the results will be presented the Board of Deutsche Bank - along with the recommendation, as is to be naloženo with it.
Then representatives of the bank at the end of January to tell us what the consequences of the draw.
At the end of it could be reducing trade in commodities or even complete rejection.
Ackermann is svépomocí on its image.
Head of the foodwatch thilo stage to welcome the report, but at the same time has increased its criticism of the financial sector: "betting on rising food prices shows especially drastically, as do the banks today is the general welfare."
Whether Ackermann as a top banking lobbyists can meet the requirements.
"Deutsche Bank must strike from his portfólia all the items for which money is used for bets on the price of food," said stage.
', whether or not the ackermannovi hunger with people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank. "
Ackermannův view seems at first glance like a surprising, but it is clear that koncernový Boss, a few months before his departure from office would like to leave a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank has announced that the boards of directors other than planned, to the Supervisory Board nepřejde.
Odvrácením from disputed an agrarian speculation could improve their image.
And possible losses may not care about - should deal with it at the end of the day, his successor.
Every second, investment in raw materials testified
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on the manager.
So far, has made more than 30,000 users of the Internet in the campaign.
On Tuesday, stage polled, in which the Institute forsa on 7 and 8 November dotazoval 1001 people.
Just 11 per cent regarded as legitimate, according to that Deutsche Bank offers investment, which are associated with bets on the price of food.
Many customers of the banks would have been drawn to the Personal consequences if they can learn that their bank accounts for such shops: every second, in turn, also testified there all the investments for which money is leaking into speculation in raw materials.
43 percent would be warned about known to a bank, 49 per cent said that they popřemýšlí expulsion of their account and moves to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Přestěhovaný pavilon
Mrs wiensowski
Story architecture with legs, and a happy ending: Austrian crashes pavilon 1958 earned the prize from the World Exhibition in Brussels, was in Vienna museem remained empty, and zpustnul.
It is now otvírán once again as a display House.
When the horuje for modern postwar architecture for clear forms, skleněné Hall, courageous rozmachy and new building materials, which are typical of faith in the technical progress, then it is an Austrian pavilon architect Karl schwanzera for Brussels world exhibition 1958 a concise and famously called an example.
Schwanzerův pavilon received at the time Grand Prix d architecture for its light and vznosně operating structure of steel and glass.
Construction is seen as so far for the milestone of contemporary architecture.
Proslavil architect so that, as well as for the next World Expo has built a pavilon Austria.
With the legendary čtyřválcovým side building in Munich at the end of the day, 1973's bmw-palácem Plus as key proslavil internationally.
Placed his as a temporary display the construction of the projected pavilon yet for the World Expo in schweizer garten in Vienna Südbahnhof South station, zrekonstruovali and opened in 1962 Museum 20th century - was, as "The house of the 20th century."
But suitable for Museum building, not prostorově or technically - walls for art objects, no peg has lacked proper climate.
Yet was used, as long as the new stánku art nedočkalo in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and chátrala more and more.
Now the architect Adolf krischanitz pavilon as to rebuild, is now the title of "the House of the 21st century" and will in the future be used as a museum contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening there will Museum Belvedere Palace, to which they belong, the first exhibition - a good idea in every respect.
Pushed the new beginning, Agnes husslein-arco that 2007 has become the new director of the Austrian galleries belvedere.
Husslein-arco, promovaná historička art with a distinguished career, M. J. krasobruslařka, later in the Sotheby's guggenheimově in early Museu and as a Founding Director Musea moderny Salzburg, pushed strongly for politicians and památkářů, opatřila reconstruction and identified the use of public funds and private donor money.
In addition to the works of art should be subjected to sochaře Fritze wotruby stejnojmennou foundations, it should be kavárna and bookshops, and had to be built to kancelářská building.
Strict supervision, low budget.
To carry out was then krischanitz ideal memberships.
Not only that as to rebuild and expand the secesní sensitive construction of Joseph olbricha in Vienna, and won the competition, but because of schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and pavilon for him was "an extremely important place," on which "just about every weekend," prohlížel exhibition.
He knew the founding and know the problems of the project, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change of use lost on their generosity and ease.
In the current reconstruction were far greater problems: the building was "katapultem for energy," says krischanitz.
Profiles of Windows skleněné fronts have been substituted, used skleněnými fibres vyztužené insulating glass ones and skleněná roof replaced by a special security sklem.
Chladové mosty-ocelové nosníky were stepped up or substituted, and asbestos vyplněné ceilings sanovány ones.
Two underground floor has rather than for the New use, zapuštěný lighting channel between the front and street obstarává lighting to the entrance leads stone - almost novostavba, but still vznosný schwanzerův pavilón.
The original front doors remain the same, it is natřena building in the old antikorozním červenohnědém see one tone.
And even kinosál is exactly the same as he had been.
And all of this with a strict supervision památkového Office and the low budget.
"often had to be found material which is good and cheap, and later památkovému Office, says krischanitz and point to a broken floor suterénu."
Despite all the pressures and reconstruction, the problems remain flexible and vzdušná building.
Difficult it was supposedly with pavilonem, "who came here from Brussels," he said recently krischanitz, with "drop-in-the-city-historie."
Such architecture, is "always in the wrong place," And yet "wants to give proper confidence."
In this case, but it is the house of the 21st century nepatřičném on the ground, as the place urbanistická happy coincidence: in the range of around schweizer garten a completely new projektovaná "urban neighborhood in the station with kancelářskými and obytnými houses."
And perhaps there will be yet another happy to chance: the House of the 21st century could receive support from other krischanitzovy works, as sběratelka Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner temporäre kunsthalle and how it is heard, it is with the City of neighbourhood on the habitats in schweizer garten.

Risk is real
After the discovery of cells in the Zwickau "Doubt" the Turkish media on the German the rule of law.
Newspapers even talking about "the ideology" that ožívá yet again.
Murder of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek in between 2000 and 2006 were right extremist background.
In this report are in Turkey and německo-tureckého population in Germany reacted with fear and concerns.
For many of the German Turks back the bogeyman, which has long been considered dead: from arson that caused death of the attacks in mölln in November 1992 and there has been no comparable with the right extremist violence in solingen in May 1993 background.
That xenophobia exists in Germany but there has never been a question about that.
Objevená right extremist network, however, reveals the scope, which no longer can not see.
"ožívá bloody ideology?" were the headlines once again the online edition of the Turkish newspapers "haberturk."
Newspapers' Sabah ', by contrast, pointed out that one of the offenders should be the secret police agent for the Protection of the Constitution and fear that German authorities could also be EU into right radical quagmire.
Judiciously Germany's Turkish community responded: vzpomněla demonstrations at the weekend the silence before the brandeburskou gate of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago vzpomněla Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policy represented an act of 50th anniversary of the německo-turecké agreement on recruitment.
In the veselých paints was zinscenován common life - as a history of success.
As a slap, Germany has several Turkish news media: "gift to padesátinám 'is nadpisem article in the Turkish Internet platform" Haber X, "which referuje on the background of the murderous series.
As well as the newspaper "hürriyet" learned not to have not transposed the philosophical links for Germany.
"It starts zapáchat ', is the headline sloupku from Ahmet külahci.
It stresses that had been murdered people, who pay taxes and make an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany their work.
Nejkritičtěji is being discussed in německotureckých Internet forums for the police and her late success in search.
Why thought that German authorities have much earlier, After the suspects pátraly in right extremist circles, it is surprising the authors.
Mnohý and is at least rhetorically swift to the drastic means: 'If there continues to be carried out activities so superficially, immigrants have nothing other than their own defense and armed. "
"It is perhaps the best self-defense."
"depends on the quality of clarification and adequacy of punishing the whole network very much internal peace in Germany," writes, "selenium."
What it means, if the inner peace is threatened in Germany, clarifying bombing in mölln and solingen in the 1990s.
Photos of the spáleniště in solingen is deeply vryta in memory of Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown any living here the Turks clearly that there is a real threat, and the Germans, distrust and distance can result in right violence
But assassinations have made on the Turks more obvious sense of reciprocity.
Not to repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was at the time, above all, criticised the failure of German policy for atentátech: Helmut Kohl to those in mölln, who survived, to visit.
After the žhářském attack in solingen soustrastný sent a telegram to Turkey's State President, left, but on the smuteční Festival in Köln to represent their Foreign Minister Klaus kinkelem - Kinkel then calculated what charges the Turks odevzdávali in his speech.
Quite so, as if the person being measured on the basis according to the height of his taxes.
The Turkish news media shows once again How deep is the lack of many German Turks in the státoprávní design.
In addition to efforts to extensive clarification and a new assessment of the right of Extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Bank scandal in curyšského lakes
Europe's nejdobrodružnější bank in Switzerland, not based in Italy or France.
UBS has suffered in the financial crisis almost bankruptcy and klouže from one crisis to another since then.
It now has a German compare.
The Axel Weber certainly thought so.
After his noisy departure from the top of the leadership of the Federal Bank, has become known in July that 2013 to almost as spektakulárního takes a new job: president of the Governing Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber were publicly praised the Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and friendly comments towards future colleagues said.
"The UBS reach turnover."
"I look forward to working with kasparem villigerem and oswaldem grübelem."
But in September, it was clear that everything will be totally different.
One dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and around 1.7 billion euro zmarnil.
The UBS board Oswald grübel respected banker, had to leave, not only in Switzerland.
Since then, President of the Board of UBS is also as a opařený - and all are asking: when will finally Axel Weber?
Already has become known, that he can advise the Bank since February 2012.
In May, and the Presidency of the Board of Directors of the Council's already - tell not only in 2013, as the Bank on Tuesday.
It will be hard for Axela Weber.
Is not a banker, a professor of economics and emissions banker and it would certainly time to translate the needed.
At the same time, will assume responsibility for the bank, which is once again proved that deserves the title "of the bank's biggest scandals in Europe"
As UBS is both great - until recently, was the largest wealth manager in the world - and klouže both for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, will not proud Swiss bank free.
It started in the financial crisis.
In 2007 požívala UBS excellent reputation.
Image of mlčenlivého and solid, but also vychytralého Property Managers is combined with the ambitious goals: I would also mean something in the investment banking.
So managed UBS 2007 on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more affluent customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, that as an investment bank in the league, the world's largest banks
That was the impression.
Former banker and longtime professor of banking in Zurich later, Hans Geiger tells his students: "I have always a good bank UBS said at the time."
"from today's point of view, I have only one asks: how could so wrong?"
Very wrong.
In 2007, it was clear that for the first time, something properly in the UBS gone wrong.
Stepped down in the middle of a board chairman Peter wuffli, which so far was also seen as highly intelligent and bankers genius.
In a few months later, tušilo, why he left.
Investment bank division has wasted subprime-papíry and had to write off billions.
For this to defend, in fact, is recommending UBS capital increase of 13 billion francs.
It recently found really investors, one of which would be even ohrnovala nose: opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one or nedověděl its name.
But that was only the first crash.
In April 2008, it was worse.
Bank had to admit new billions of dollars of losses, President of the Board of Directors of the Council Marcel ospel, 2006, for a second best all paid the Board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008 a disaster: the UBS was due to its bad investments from collapse in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank odkoupila from UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, for which could be spolumajitelkou banks.
The whole of Switzerland was otřeseno - as we všimlo, as it is dramatic for a small country, as it has on its territory and the big banks.
After all, balance the sum was Switzerland's UBS 2007, more than five times greater than the performance of the economy - see picture.
"Once again, we could save UBS 'banking expert Geiger says.
The disaster follows another.
For several months now has capitulated to UBS in a tax dispute with America and the data has shown a willingness to the wealthy customers who, if possible, to help the banks krátili taxes.
Also agreed to vyplacením 780 million dollars - such as the return of unjustified profits from these stores, including pokutové charges.
This has more or less openly that helped UBS tax cuts.
Lost at the same time, something that has always been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: svatozář secrecy.
After this scandal has been the Swiss banking secrecy, as before.
Followed by the head of the Board and President of the Board of Directors of the Council.
And the exodus of customers' money.
So the Bank has lost its credibility in both the central business areas: in the space of a few months in the investment banking because of the bad speculation and in wealth management for helping to cut taxes.
And just when this, a bit of calm, just when it is believed that UBS will pick up again, here comes this wretched business anabáze: one dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euro before Bank zpozorovala, that something is wrong.
And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking that probably still must be wrong.
"case adoboli far too little has changed around, it was found that the health risks," says Martin Janssen, economist and finanz professor of finance at the banking Institute of the University Zürich.
The financial director of a large German banks is sure: "UBS problem lies in the fact that the risk is not coping with the control."
Yet this was, after all, is the idea of a Swiss Bankers caution that start a long time ago, to become hlídači large estates in the world: not too much of a risk, but safety for money - as well as from the party of the Alpine republic, the collapse of the world.
Trezory Swiss banks have become a symbol for an unshakable reliability as a Lindt and sprüngli for particularly good chocolate.
Headquarters UBS in Zurich, the more suited to cliché good Swiss private banks - it is just a little more.
Location is no longer classical.
Bank has its headquarters in curyšské bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the curyšskému jezeru, which is zarámováno zasněženými heights Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, Pronájmy stores is one of the highest in Europe.
Klenotnictví as Tiffany 'with there will be between the Swiss traditional stores such as ice cream parlors sprüngli.
Already there is the home of Swiss banks for centuries, from the Nationalbank over palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bär.
In recepční shed UBS is heavy otáčivými doors.
Inside the walls are obložené mramorem in front of them massive Kožená seats, in addition to the large banks směrovka logo to "sejfu."
UBS here knows what the customer is looking for: a security.
This idea of both the Swiss velkobanky Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse by or zradily, but sometimes - as is one of a small Swiss private bank head.
His name would not want to read in the newspapers, concludes at the end of the day, as Swiss Bankers, all with two velkobankami shops.
UBS, perhaps too grown, finds - particularly in investment banking, where it is passed anglosasové.
The Swiss to perhaps do not have something to say.
"And if after all, adapt to the long Anglo-Saxon ways systems."
It was Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which UBS has precipitated her first high profits and then momentum: none of the European Institute of financial disaster not lost in the jungle around subprime as much money as schweizer großbank.
15 October 2008 disaster was clear.
"IN THE CENTER, agreed the ruling coalition sedmimilionové small countries on the biggest rescue action in the history of our nation," he writes Lukas hässig in his book "Der ubs-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros approved based velkobanku politicians to save from bankruptcy.
How can this happen?
If we are talking with the Swiss Bankers, so they see the problem in the first place, the size of UBS.
In June 1998, joined two of the three Swiss velkobank into massive concern.
A bank, which is already In a merger was too large to small Switzerland - and grew still further.
Yet be assisted, that the two different banking predecessor complement: a rich, but ospalá bank UBS in Zurich with the focus on wealth management, and poorer, but internationally more involved.
Suddenly came internacionalizovaní investment bankers favourably to many of the money with which they can jump-start a roulette.
Two names associated with the rise of UBS are: Peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, UBS chief concern and Marcel ospel, Chairman of the Board at the time.
"I have always thought that wuffli and ospel are the team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and ospel, one following the feelings around žaludku, who drafted completely up the Bank of science."
But ospel is said to have relied on wuffliho to an end.
And at the end of wuffli probably made a mistake: "Perhaps thought that his models are a reality," said Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: hubris preceded the fall.
UBS employees can clearly recall the managers' meetings, in which koncernový Chief wuffli repeated again and again the same slogan: bring the Goldman Sachs of the throne of the mines.
The bank has been the world's most powerful Investment Bank.
To "league tables, access," which documents the success of banks that time.
In it, the UBS sought to putting up completely.
Several steps it has already forged.
In the trade of currency and stock up part of the game completely.
Podnikoví advisers, who have been charged with the one weakness: in the international úrokovém trade, however, in the language of bankers' fixed income for the biggest banks, perhaps there is a big gap. "
UBS has some gaps in the US hypotéčních products.
To fill the gap closed, poised to UBS to adventure, which almost cost the existence of it.
Hungry for growth, investment bank itself as well as it based on ensuring the risks to US investment fund subprime.
Developed into a machine, which přebaloval on US mortgage loans and securities an on - at the same time, but also himself leaving the risks.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the property market was in flames, UBS kupovala there," says banking expert Geiger.
How much is eufórie, so deep down.
One manager after another had to leave when he attempts uklidit were more difficult than had been thought.
Position at UBS, has been katapultovacím seat and until now houpou.
Who is velkobanku now has nearly nezvládnutelnou work.
Must find a strategy for the bank, all of which disappeared near business models.
Banking expert Geiger has no idea: the end of investment banking, focus on management of the property, a return to the Swiss roots.
Quite so far while the Bank - still - does not want to go.
But investment banking has severely cut, so it is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of bank Sergio ermotti intends to present to the world its future strategy.
51-letý Swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, in fact, when the bank surprisingly rozešla predecessor grübelem.
Meanwhile, pushed: has the lead in the long term business UBS, told curyšská Bank on Tuesday.

But it will not be enough.
UBS needs vision.

The massacre at a personal level
Peter englunda emotionally strong new book called the beauty and the sorrow: private history of the First World War, the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history instead of the First World War, and a long list of speakers figures, when you zatočí head.
One, as they are in the moment to maintain the Council: carefully this side of the vytrhněte and do the záložku from it.
With all the people you look the románovém narrative of Mr englunda very well at this list and you will serve as a Navigation - as a kind of beacon - at a time when, as well as the men and women in the story you feel confused and missing in different situations can be brought.
Mr Englund is Swedish historian and journalist.
There is also a new Deputy Secretary at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Paper, which we are discussing here, it is very unusual - the author himself, rather aptly describes it as "antihistorickou work."
Contains some very familiar names, important agreements, or of the famous battles, on the other hand, it almost is lacking in Ambassador, energetic journalists and the debate about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as more "book about what it was." It is mainly about "sentiments, dojmech, experience and moods."
"The beauty and the sorrow in each other," combines war experiences 20 more or less tuctových men and women on both sides of the divide, from female students and botaniků to horolezce, doctors, záchranek drivers and officials.
Some of these people are heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, the citizens zblázní or die.
Their lives are mihotají As the flames of candles zapálených in church - new to add to the spletence fates, while others uhasínají.
Mr englunda paper is different from the traditional historical novels.
That regulates the idea of the First World War was just a hrůzostrašných zákopových fighting on the Western Front.
"The beauty and the sorrow" zručně prozkoumává, as well as other places, where there was a war dramas: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, eastern Africa.
Soldiers in this Paper addresses problems with the falling bee nests on them, must spend Christmas in the shadow of who built the pyramids or are dealing with the presence of flies tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning it is a very moving reading.
War consumes the lives of people like a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina páchnoucí powder keg.
When will begin being raised in the distance jump of works and you are the one who is at home with their children, utečete or zůstanete?
Who is it coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, or even why the war was unleashed.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," observed Mr Englund, "was vyplněno haggling, domněnkami hopes, fears, prejudice, konspiračními theories, dreams, nočními můrami and fámami."
"The beauty and the sorrow" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence farmboroughová English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young námořník serving in the German flotile.
Their stories are already published all přebírány from životopisů, letters and other materials.
Poutavě descriptions of their lives can be scary, but thanks to the inclusion of the small moments and details are very lively and credible.
Many of them about suffering and catching up with him.
In the story of a German students author says: "alternatives, all the substitutes."
"A substitute for coffee, napodobenina aluminium, imitation gumy, paper obvazy, wooden knoflíky."
Food goes even further and describes the substitutes in Germany.
It refers to the "meat vyrobeném from pressed rice vařené in skopovém fat and supplemented by a false outside of timber, tobacco from dried roots and dried bramborových slupek, their shoes with wood podrážkami."
Says that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of párků and 511 registered substitutes, coffee."
Some of the stories are about honor and bravery.
One American in itself is the internal incentives to divokosti and brutality, and on the war, saying: "At the end of the day, you will understand that it is human nature, not sit in comfortable seats with a cigarette and whisky, večerními newspapers or good paper and pretend that this is your mask civilisation, and that is for the škrobeným I in the heart is no Barbar."
On the other hand, the British soldier is aware that, with the greatest likelihood of die soon and no one even wo n't notice, let alone to truchlil.
"When you finally done with the fact that the sacrifices, would at least expected to happen in front of vděčného audience," she writes.
Instead, however, is as "odsouzenec that secretly oběsí."
Other comments on the departure of old Europe and the new horrors.
"The conflict is increasingly used to cost economic competition and competitive struggle," Mr Englund writes, "the war between factories."
- what is called "a new kind of bestie an emerging Century: výřečný and ideologically controlled by a bitter serial killer in the clothes střižených their bloodshed on peace, which carries out without rising from the table."
People are completely unexpected, podlost does with hrdinstvím.
Mr Englund describes as well as soldiers, who are from the prostitutek intentionally tried to catch any kind of sexual disease, so as to avoid service on the front.
"nejgrotesknějším example of this treatment has been trading with gonokokovým hnisem soldiers, which buy and deter the genitálie, in the hope that it will end up in the hospital," she writes.
"The most desperate to vtírali it in the eye, which is often oslepilo until the end of life."
In this translation of the švédštiny from Peter gravese is próza Mr englunda speedy, but not ostentatious, which is perfectly suited to his human subject.
In dozens of small output captures the way war unleashed totally uncontrollable forces: "extreme nationalism, a social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to ask why their leaders is to fight.
Majority rather than the best books about the First World War with a comprehensive vyprávěním worked with signs such as "the First World War and the Modern Memory" from Paul fussella or novels such as "All quiet on the Western Front" from ericha Maria remarquea vice versa.
Mr Englund prefers nekonvenčnímu concept.
His book is the most devastating conclusion, which is unprecedented in the popular naučné literature.
You, however, I will not be revealing it.
You seem as if at the same time, however, the author jumped from the book, you vytrhl side from the list of heroes of the hand and zapálil it.
After the previous mistake, this time at the minute is a planned raid
Done it hundreds of police officers, some in the přilbách used in street riots.
Overnight, from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because it should be Park zuccotti almost empty at the time.
No one except a few senior officers knew about the action; others were first told that it was an exercise.
At the forefront of the action, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence has many problems, has had to face police department in the operation.
From repeated cases of the past few weeks, where there has been, for example, to use pepřových sprejů against the demonstrators, which it has been violated department rules, and then the wave of public sympathy been siphoned off the side of the squatterů.
Why the police operation, the aim of which was to clean up the park zuccotti from demonstrators, launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
Leaders have to learn from those proběhnuvšími in other cities.
Massive exercise in case of behaviour in crisis situations, took place in a part of Randalls Iceland, which has been preparing for the action in zuccotti park.
Leaders of increasing the training for the suppression of unrest - counterterrorism measures, including the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the urban part of lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place in the East River Monday night, on the manhattanské side.
Orders to move in the park have literally "at the last moment," said someone who has been action originally represented only as "exercise."
"I know a couple of police officers who were sent to this action also brought, and certainly no one has said that goes to the park zuccotti ones," said the person, who spoke only on condition that it stays in anonymity.
"that goes to the park zuccotti, known only by the position of the members of the Department."
One because of the secrecy was a lesson that the city already have received one.
14 October had the leaders of the city in the park to clean up, but then give up the demonstrators, because as soon as we heard about it, nahrnuli before the start of operations in the park over hundreds of them.
Tuesday in the police action from various units, including the battle groups from around the region - dozens of police officers, who are routinely used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that during the day and comes to park, leaving a large number of people, so one hour on the night was the ideal time to launch, when the action.
"It was appropriate to this, at a time when it will be in People's Park as little as possible," he said.
Than troops knocking seřadily, on the border of pike slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt drive streets, near the bridge Manhattan Bridge, freight cars of the emergency units with obloukovými lampami and amplióny.
Light and nahraná burácející report from amplionů many demonstrators vystrašily.
When the park have many demonstrators, members of the pořádkových units in their blue větrovkách, sbalilo their things and leave.
Police said that, up to 1:45 morning, unaffected by a single tent, which would give the protesters time to the sbalili.
Other teams of police officers have been seen in it, as are gathering at the Park, so that they can vniknout, if it was necessary to carry out any arrests.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesman for the Police Department, Paul J. Brown, argued that it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, is of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them to see its troops in action, and some police officers acted on them deeply.
Mr Brown argued that television vehicles on Church Street leading along the western borders of the park can natáčet without problems.
Police moved westward and bound up with a good deal of změtí personal items, including luggage and its igelitových bags full of clothes protesters. hygienického unit, which immediately behind them knocking teams shrabovaly everything in the left.
Some of the demonstrators, who have rejected the move, were from the park vyvlečeni. dokumentující obrazové material with a moment, then appeared on the Internet.
Most hardened group of demonstrators resorted to the vicinity of kitchens in their tábořišti, which lay near the centre of the park.
Some set up a road block and the police launched their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the heart of the tábořiště to each other připoutalo.
And two people přivázali to a tree, Mr Kelly said.
Were called members of the emergency services to přeřízli locks.
Up to 3:30 announced this morning in the park did not go any arrests, Mr Kelly.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the sound of the police.
Mr Brown said that approximately 142 people have been detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place on the grounds of "the riots and an opposition in the arrests," explained.
The most senior police officer on the ground action was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the most senior uniformovaný officer in the department.
Operations had also Phil T. Pulaski, commander of detektivů personally on separation.
Mr Kelly was present, but "involved in the management of the operation," Mr Brown said.
The second group of police officers waiting along the eastern side of broadwaye, between the streets of Liberty Street, and Cedar Street, in case they need to be, that it was necessary to call it.
On the street Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the street Pine Street, a block south of the park, have been vztyčeny road.
In these places, the police a protective belt even further from the park zuccotti.
On the ground have been spatřeni police officers, many of whom have been equipped with shields, How are people even further for the border.
On the northern border was about 28 people.
Wildest imaginable actions the night took place south of the park.
Around five hours this morning was spatřen not allowed one of the demonstrant south of the Pine Street, I jumped on the hood of a police car, and a few others, who vypouštěli air from the tyres of police vans.
At one point of the crowd have soared piece of překližky.
At the end of the operation was to one police officer and one of the protesters.
Auxiliary Workers' Union will sue the city for release
Trade unions representing hundreds of school assistance for workers who lost their jobs last month, on Wednesday zažalovat city plan, arguing that the dismissal was necessary, and it was about the discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, which are poor students.
Court case is likely to be the last option, which the unions in the area district council remains 37, in their efforts to reverse the decision on layoffs.
7 October six hundred seventy two school staff have lost their jobs, parental coordinators and other city employees, who were among the worst paid employees and their release of leading members of the trade unions described as revenge for this city, last spring that he had not allowed access to the health care spravovanému jobs like četami, with which the city filled a hole in the budget.
City officials flatly rejected the charge.
At the City Council meeting, which was held last month, secretary of education Dennis M. Walcott said that the dismissal was part of a budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately countered by saying that in the budget with the release of the auxiliary workers Anywhere in particular, taken away from them.
Leaders of the urban parts of the District Council 37, announced that already close the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education, that it will sue. svolají press conference on Wednesday, where formally announce action in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Obžalovanými in the process will be the Walcott and the Ministry of Education, While the Prosecutor party will be eight redundant workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth thomasová, a spokesman for the legal department of the City, said that the city still claim nevidělo and, therefore, will not comment on various charges.
According to the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, trade unions to focus on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, which wanted to support its claims of an unfair negotiations; hold the view that the poor schools lost more assistants, because they are already deprived of adequate financial resources in the long term.
Point to the fact that while in schools in parts of the Staten Iceland has nepropouštělo at all, and only in a part of the Upper East Side, at least in Brownsville lost their jobs in the brooklynu in parts of the District 23 17 school assistants and even in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was released 46 assistants.
Reminds us that, at Public School 36 in Harlem was five of the eight assistants have lost their jobs, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, and in action, says: "It's not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents who can obstarávat funds to compensate for the shortfall in the budget."
School, Public School 36 budget has been cut by 3,26 per cent and school also lost money this year, when the city changed the way of calculating bonusových for every poor student přihlášeného funding.
Unions claim, among other things, that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which was written document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators.
In the document was to describe the action used the word "excess," abolish the position, even though it is more often used to describe the redeployment of teachers from pay charter schools to the database of available workers, whose pay is provided by the central authority.
"sixty six parental coordinators have been released," is in the complaint, "and not only moved to the database at the position of available workers."
Mission is at an end, Congress is prepared to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something that has to do with the uprising in Libya.
Than to do this, however, has had a revolution to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States made closed.
On Tuesday, the Commission will decide on the Senate's international relations, which supports President John Kerry - Mass. - together with Senators John McCain and Joseph I. liebermanem - Ariz. - - Conn. - in which should congratulate the Libyans to their successful insurgency and thank the American troops for "courage."
"This statement we want to pay tribute to the courage of the people of Libya, who started with recasting of their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic aspirations."
The sentence may look innocent, but any debate concerning Libya, to date, has not been easy.
During the summer, lawmakers from both parties are constantly were trying to agree among themselves, with the White House on the wording of the statement, for approval or rejection of the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution allowing for the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the different views of both political parties, so it is never a vote in the Senate.
The same day, however, when he was in the House rejected this proposal, the Chamber rejected measures that would stop funding US operations in Libya.
The US mission in Libya is literally in the legislative očistci - criticised the way in which President Obama mission by Congress, but its members that nedráždilo clearly enough to support him in his actions stopped.
Reluctance to Congress at the end of the day's other events.
In August, rebels captured Tripoli and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now is the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations in his statement "congratulates itself for the Libyan people for their immense courage and remarkable resilience, which invested in a bid to free its people" and praised "the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its allies, who were involved in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for the extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The declaration also confirms the national interest of the United States "for a successful and nezvratném transition to democracy in Libya."
Will receive the new proposal for the Commission's full support for International Relations, or will the legislators divided into two half again, as was the case for June proposal?
The latest version of opposed Senator Richard G. Lugar Ind., the main representative of the Republican party in the Commission.
Lugarův spokesman on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has not yet seen.
In the House this week will vote on the amendment to the constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by the bobem goodlattem Va., will be the first addition to the Constitution on the budget or any other issue, which will vote on the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far not even despite the considerable efforts still has its proposals through to the vote.
Goodlattův proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which have been introduced in Congress and dotýkaly a wide range of different topics.
Some of them are the same - the same proposal put forward by the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the addition of a balanced budget and another handful, that would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the Young Republicans, who want to improve the reputation of - can boast of their "ownership for."
RETURN OF THE regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, would require the House to vote on the amendment on a balanced budget, as well as the Senate.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement supporting the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget wants to discuss several Members, as well as limiting the number of times, in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano - N.Y. - it wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the post of president.
Representatives of the Jesse L. Jackson Jr. - ill. - offer a number of amendments that would, among other things, guaranteeing the right to quality education and medical care.
A proposal remains amendment banning couples of the same sex marriages and amendment to ban flag burning state.
Some lawmakers also want to anulování federal laws in a case that will stand up to two thirds of the States against them.
Though, it seems that they are very active members of Congress in the drafting of the various amendments, but not significantly nevybočují of average in comparison with previous years ago.
In 111 Congress offered 77 letters, while Congress there were 66 in the 100.
Their activity even pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s, when, according to the statistics Senate members every two years, more than 150 amendments offered library.
Not, however, a much more successful than the current politicians.
The amendment, which was added - 27 - an amendment was ratified in 1992 but, in fact, Congress has been designed, in 1789.
"zmlácená but not defeated," said the giffordová in his first TV interview since firing by
Ten months after it from the immediate vicinity of poranil shooter at a public meeting with voters in the tucsonu, Gabrielle gifffordsová - Ariz. - appeared on national television on Monday evening, zazpívala, together with the melodií from broadwayské show "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said that more than a return to Congress is to being treated.
Giffordsová contained in the agenda of the "20/20" to the ABC News with Diane sawyerovou. It can be seen that the sentences it still makes the problems and in walking needed help.
The show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of injuries caused by an, which it front worked through on lebku bullet, tap cheap at the back half of the brain and it came out of the van.
Three months ago, returned to the House to be triumphant in a vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January firing by, in which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, giffordsová usmívala about and zpívala - with their recovery, described as "difficult."
When it sawyerová ask how they feel, responded jednačtyřicetiletá giffordsová: "Well."
Conversation with giffordsovou and her husband, astronautem markem kellym, was part of hodinového speciálu work on "20/20," which was broadcast on the eve of the publication of this new book The couple, with the title "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
Speciál followed a recovery giffordové from firing by on 8 January.
At the videích, which natočil Kelly during the first week, we see giffordsová in a hospital bed with vyholenou head and a long jizvou across the whole of čelo.
While her husband encourages it, can not rise more than just one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, giffordsová, depicted as sitting in the kolečkovém seat and therapists, it teaches how to execute a simple activities.
Pokývání head.
May pour vyšpulení lips.
And then, her first word: "what."
Within a couple of days giffordsová said another word, "toast" When dožadovala changes in their breakfast.
Videos odvysílaná station ABC show that a central role for the recovery giffordsové played the music: kongresmanka words on them, along with terapeutem very in tune to the písním "girls just wanna have fun" from the Cyndi lauperové and "free fallin from Tom pettyho." '
During the interview giffordová, which takes two hours a day, sawyerové therapy have told that, from the day when there has been a shooting, no memory of.
Her husband said that the giffordové read newspaper articles about the shooting until 12 March, when she asked him for the first time, who was six, who was killed in incident.
From the firing by the suspect Jared Lee is loughner, which is being held in a prison in missoury, where forcibly lodged under the influence of drugs are waiting for trial.
"A lot of people died," said giffordsová sawyerové.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly sawyerové reveal that at one point his wife during the rekonvalescence said: "I have lost."
"So I said: Gabby, neprohrálas it right now," describing the Kelly.
"You just got nakládačku.
But they zvládneš, dáš together and vrátíš is even stronger than ever before. "
Military units are faced with compassion rather than with respect
The event was galavečerem on Wall Street, which made millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who do not have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock zazpíval baladu of powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Since the hundreds of soldiers, sailors, letců and mariňáků around it.
Inaugurated oblečený crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
"The men and women serving in the army were regarded as heroes," said David Saltzman that spring benefici hosted.
Formal evening attended, as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. In addition to the general Admiral Mike Mullen, who was on the ground, however, it saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
"All of us have been presented as some orphans," an officer wrote in an email.
I am sure that the organisers thought it so well.
I know that, yes.
But what I saw was not respect; it was a pity.
So completely the opposite perceptions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is bezbřeze are often included praise for for their victims.
But this is something praise, soldiers say.
The public are increasingly behaving as if the individuals in uniform regretted.
"We are not at all the victims," said Brigadier General will soon be leaving Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to some of us can support, is to put us in the position of the unfortunate souls."
This issue is very sensitive for the army commander, who did not want to be nevděčně or to harm relations with the public, which serves.
Also realize that anger, which had to face once troops returning from Vietnam, was much worse.
The result is that most of the words of regret is pronášena in silence and in private between the war veterans.
When the two sons retired Colonel mark Cancian returning from combat actions, where is their father, served as members of the Marines, warned that look at their service will be people outside the army from two angles.
From the point of view of Some will feel the respect and amazement because defeat the enemy insurgents, and visited exotická jobs.
Other but will vrtat head, whether the "Beneath the surface, neukrývá bad, violent," said veteran Cancian, who were involved in the fighting in Iraq and the return of a place in the government in Washington.
Said that, when he sought a job and some of the people who do the interviews with him, they indicated that so soon after the return to the fight can withstand the stress, which is associated with the work in Washington.
"When you talk about their service, you must take into account the negative reactions," poučoval Cancian their sons.
Concern army partly stems from the American indifference to the wars.
Achievements on the field rarely get the recognition in the country, which has its own little awareness and the army in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are just a few of the benefit.
"As a nation, have nevážíme military heroism, as have been common in the Second World War," said Lt. Gen. David barno, who commanded the American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of the men under arms.
Soldiers are vyznamenáváni number of actions, which přetrpěli, a lot of friends who have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
Army faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week to determine whether the court process will begin 28 women and men against the army because of alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, are ready to bring to the hundreds of other applicants.
Vojínovi first class Elizabeth lymanové was in the night, when it was allegedly raped by my colleague from the army for 25 years and has been in the 11th week of pregnancy.
Was in October 2008 and it pointed to the kasáren at the air base Miramar north of San diega. After dinner with crony have met with her male colleague of boxes with 12 pivy.
Ask, if we can add to it, that it could with her in the room a little popít.
"in the press, I heed the warning light," described lymanová.
But rodilý texasan completely ignored its objections.
I thought: No, he is 19.
"It is from Texas," she said.
"I wish I listened to my gut."
Claims that only a couple of minutes after vešli turn into the room, the man, threw it on the bed and znásilnil.
This week, 18 November, will be lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military to wait for the verdict of the hearings, which could be of historic impact. It will take place in the arlingtonu in virginii and goes in it, whether the accusations against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, donaldu fail, gets to court.
In the indictment states that Gates and he failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is at odds with the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Charges have been made in February the Washington lawyer Susan burkeovou and prosecutor party at the time had 17 members over the next few months, however, the number has risen to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all claim that they have been znásilněni or otherwise sexually attacked his colleagues in the army and the army after the announcement of these útků failed in the investigation, punishment, as well as any of the pursuit of justice.
Burkeová say that it is for the neck by senior commanders of the army, because the problem is just for them.
"The army is direktivním system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position that they can avoid trying to implement measures against such action? High Command."
Burkeová also says that at least 400 other survivors called since February, from which many of them could become involved in other lawsuits brought in the future.
Its strategy, rather than to seskupila all the accused in this case - naskládala all the eggs in one košíku as it itself - will action in several different cases, if necessary, to pressure nepolevil.
State representative of the United States team for the Department of defense is Neil macbride which, together with its staff gave impetus to the rejection of the case.
Court documents, which won the Newsweek detail so far consider defence strategy - the bottom line is that current or former Soldiers can not sue army for the injuries, which have suffered as the members of the armed forces.
According to the Supreme Court of the 1950's as a feres doctrine federal government is not responsible for injuries, which suffers the soldiers in active service.
'alleged injuries related to military service žalujících, "writes in the document.
The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Even though women are still officially must not be used in the fight, it was just a clever: in modern warfare can be hard to find a clear the battle lines drawn.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have teams of female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women vyskytujícími in the war zone.
The result: Between the wars there were 150 female soldiers - two thirds of them directly in the fight.
It is time to modernise and in the army, burkeová explains.
In their fight is not alone and, in this case with three other legal representatives.
At Yale Law School preparing for the four main visitors veteránského seminar on legal services and Military Academy for promoting hatred of women suspected of developing the atmosphere.
Independent non-profit Organization of American Vietnamese veterans' On this basis for its action of moving against the army and the action focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which were allegedly found on the victims of rape, in order to give the military a pretext for their release, according to activists, such as, for example, Anu bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women's Action network, it is a fairly common practice.
Her group has already submitted the proposal in December of actions against the state organization for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for help from people who claimed they were sexually abused in the service.
Nine separate proposals in Congress has been introduced, which presented a group of senators and members of both political parties, and proposed a series of amending the measure in them.
According to the Defense Department office to prevent and resolve of sexual violence, nahlášeno 3 158 sexual attacks in 2010.
This type of attacks, however, remains in the majority of cases neohlášen and according to its own estimates of the Pentagon, this figure is the equivalent of about 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents have occurred in the year.
In reports issued in March, is dismantled, as well as the criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, to court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half over the civilian judicial system.
Prosecutors in the case of a burkeové describe attacks just as the first of a series of traumas.
Vojín first class lymanová nahlásila alleged rape by military police, for example, less than an hour later, as it should be.
During the night, he says, has been asked for details about his repeated rape 11 times the various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
Undergo all the investigations needed to identify the rape and blood was found in her bed could - from the wounds, which made him on the arm.
About six months later, in April 2009, had lymanová hearing before the court, during which they have been treated questions on whether she loved in the day of the attack, my friend.
Six people have been předvoláno, which as witnesses on the reputation of the vypovídaly in favour of the alleged perpetrators, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the sentence was handed down," said the lymanová.
"I had the feeling that, right there on the ground porodím - I vyběhla with shouting from the courtroom."
"Put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I think I am that my velícímu důstojníkovi: said it was not his court was my."
Lymanové přikázali visit military psychiatrist, who with her at the end of the day, diagnostikoval personality disorder, which it described as nezpůsobilou to service.
In January 2010, was released from the army without honor and therefore with no right to výsluhu.
Whether or not the case lymanové and other žalobců will move to the next stage, it is there for the long haul, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law.
But, notes, "from my point of view, they should be able to move to other stages of consultation."
The doctrine, which stand between them and the verdict, however, has been criticized from the outset, we can see the light of day.
I myself have lifelong critic doctrine feres doctrine.
Army is a few decades behind, because of their responsibilities neudávají adhere to the same level motivačních incentives and deterrent funding.
Adds: "Chances are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try it."
Change to occur only when good people will be willing to fight.
If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, burkevoá, lawyer žalujících, gathered hundreds of other people ready to take legal action and will start work on other cases on this issue.
"We will not stop with the military fight on this issue, where there is no reform," he says.
Or as long as neumřeme, depending on what comes before.
Walls have eyes: scientists are exploring how you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring breivik has become the new face of right extremism in Europe, was just Another young man, who his anti-immigrant views presented on the Internet.
On Monday, the braivik, who has confessed to červencovému vraždícímu rage, after which left 77 people dead in Norway, in his first public court hearing.
Despite breivik could act alone, in cyberspace is solitary: during the preparation of the attack was not spent a lot of time in front of computers, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists, supporting the right of a group on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about those people.
But as it is to find?
Easy - just off of Facebook.
"We have realized that get, it is not at all, so it is difficult," said Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recently published report of the British research team, which was about the European Digital populism.
Of personal information on Facebook, Bartlett says, is so vast that scientists had to simply take advantage of advertising on the site and because of that, with complete accuracy determine hledanou demographic group - something that marketingoví workers do for years.
Bartlettův team across Europe found half a million fans right groups and focus attention on them and circulated them buses. But instead of them is through them zvali into a newly formed group called them or offer any dietní products, is to fill in the questionnaire, which found the questions about the level of their education, their relation to violence and optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, bartlettovi and his colleagues have managed to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans, 14 different right wing groups in 11 European countries - all without having had to leave office.
"This is a completely new way of doing research," notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of the rightist groups are mostly young men, who popuzuje rising levels of immigration.
But, on the other hand, "Those who their online activism combine with off-line aktivismem are more intelligent, more democratic and less násilničtí than those who remain constantly ukryti for screen of a computer."
Work team demos is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers these sites used to study everything from health issues to social trends of sheltering aktualizacemi, contributions to the walls and stisknutými tlačítky "I like."
Facebook claims more than 800 million active users, each and every one of them a day on average, with three different data, which makes this social network literally "information supernovu ', which is for the development of many of the new research, and the number of academic work, in whose name is the word Facebook, has risen to nearly 800% compared to the situation five years ago.
For some of the scientists is the Facebook that gives them the opportunity to study people without it, that had to bother somewhere on the street.
"previously was that if you wanted to carry out a survey of the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go to the party, where Bartlett says not, but you never lose."
"All of this Facebook odbourává - just go directly to them."
Others argue that site can offer a way to identify společensko-zdravotní problem and to avoid them.
In a recent study doktorky Megan morenové from universities in the wisconsinu, the research team found that university students, who were raising their Serbia following a drunken output on Facebook, much more at risk of alcoholism problem than students who silent on this issue.
Morenová suggests that vrstevníci student monitor and come up with the supply of aid studentovi site, which publishes too many opileckých statusů.
"The problem can not be resolved, if you can not diagnose it," he told the Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of doktorky morenové and Director of the Center for children's health, behavior and development at dětském Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify children at risk, that we would otherwise not have had the chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly sonduje data of its users.
Information team sites by the statistics on the connection vztahových statusů and St. Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010 and leverage the satisfaction of the nation - mainly through the use of information, which should approach - internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should her information treasure to research, as well as the other available.
But Facebook users know that it is the monitors, whether they like it or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with crony, which is thousands of miles away, there is a need to provide their personal information website.
But what if Facebook users become part of the research, which do not know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to gather the data off-line online data, however, are open to everyone.
"I think the majority of users or imagined that scientists could look to their profiles," says Neil Selwyn sociologist in London knowledge lab, of the 2006 study, carried out by the public facebookových walls of their students.
"When it comes to them, take it, that the information is only between them and their friends."
Then we also consider the methodology.
And in research off-line, there is no guarantee that the body is completely sincere.
On Facebook it is impossible to verify, of how much of the information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.
"What you are saying on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, these things are two completely segmented," explains Selwyn.
That is precisely why we Selwin, who spent long years research new technologies, thinks that tužka and zápisník continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
"When vyrazíte into the real world and you talk with real people, this is something that can not be replaced," he says.
"social research should be on society and social activities - and hell a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring breivik is taking part in his first public court trial
Anders Behring breivik, the man who has confessed to planning the two attacks, in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway in Oslo, during his first public court hearing described itself as a fighter "resistance."
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement, and between norskými templářskými rytíři," he said before the court, where 500 people have gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice, because you have given the mandate to support an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"doznávám to their actions, but nepřiznávám no blame for them."
Judge torkjel nesheim during this monologue breivik off, because "did not want to give breivikovi opportunity for this hearing to use as a platform from which it could proclaim their views."
Breivikovi rejected for the same reason, that has brought with it a speech prepared, allow at the end of a hearing to address the relatives of their victims.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep breivik in custody the next 12 weeks, banned him any contact with the media for a period of 4 týnů and announced that pravomocné authorities for a period of eight weeks will have complete control over all his visits and all the korespondencí.
Hearing involved about 30 relatives of victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they will be able to breivikovi look in the eye, the others, in order to make sure that it is held firmly locked.
All were involved in order to move the case to the early closure.
"It seemed to me that seemed unemotionally, and the most inhuman way," he said komentátorovi NRK one of the survivors of the attack.
"Nothing has been a comfortable, but then, as I saw for myself, I can say that, and uslyšel suspect, I am mentally moved a little bit further."
Breivik, in tmavém suit and blue kravatě remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. žurnalistům and retreat into the buildings without difficulty hledem present came in, as well as the surviving in the eye.
Despite breivik's bizarre idea that is part of a larger movement "resistance," Judge naznal, that it is not crazy, and pointed out that there is no evidence to suggest he had any accomplices.
For some consolation may be that the attacks appear to be the work of a single extremists from 22 June and not of the radicals.
It automatically does not diminish the sadness and confusion, however, which are still in the minds and hearts of the people.
"I would like to see the vypadla as stvůra, but this is not so," he said of relatives of one of the victims.
"If Yes, everything would be much easier."
7 Lessons from a lost interview with stevem jobsem in the film mířícím in cinemas this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of the people who have started - comparing it with Henry Ford - and chose him for his genialitu biggest modern vynálezcem.
The recently znovuobjeveném jobsově interview, which was oprášen for special film, which is in cinemas this week, will be Apple's fans the fact that for all his creative minds perfectly well understood business processes and working patterns underlying for its products.
Was fantastic designérem, the dream maker and a self-proclaimed member of the movement hippie, but at the same time, pedantským organizer and a man who fits every detail in detail - believed that, indeed, many businesses are suffering from "the notion that a great idea but it is 90 per cent of their work... -LSB- and between a great idea and a great final product is still a long way to go sousta work."
In 1995, he worked Bob cringely on TV on the triumph of the computer bláznů, which was about the dawn of the personal computer, during the natáčení is a unique, more than conversation per hour worked.
It has been for the last ten years, since the time jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with your new computer company next and eagerly vyhlížel, as the general public accepts the Internet.
In TV agenda was used at the end of the day, only a tiny part of the whole cringelyho discussion and the original copies tradovalo interview, that have been lost in the transfer.
Shortly after the jobsově penalty, however, have been found VHS copies in the režisérově the garage.
This material, to say the least, sestříhaný form the basis of a 68minutového Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, which is in selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who was famous for its AN to provide longer talks, jobs are up surprisingly enthusiastic here, that we can rozpovídat on its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And also has proved to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, that the question and the answer will be a prolonged lull - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is to see how the jobs promýšlí perfectly, so that was what nejvýstižnější and the most accurate answer.
There are also moments when on the surface vyplouvá jobsův perfekcionismus, when in cringelyho issues are impatient, and popohání it to more quickly came to important issues and topics.
Conversation was natočen before the era of pixaru ipodu or iphonu and there are only terrifyingly prescient example ideas, when jobs are in it, what other companies are doing well and badly, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to browse the posmrtná rating jobsovy career, but to the jobsovi, which we see as a dychtivého snílka flourish in his geniality is something raw and inspiring.
Here has its own vision of how it could and should be.
Before long, and after their ideas put forward is also began putting into practice.
A summary of the seven scenes of lost interview, which certainly worth noting:
Both have learned to manage the business:
Business over the years, I have always asked: "Why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that is how it just does."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks about matters relating to business in depth.
I found it.
Jobs is the fact that Apple describes their efforts to simplify the books in society.
Was totally confused by the way in which they were recorded costs - often start from the slogan "standard" on their level of could only help but wonder at that point, we decided to get out of their own way - Into the automatic tool, which guarantee that could determine during the chviličky trade costs.
As he rošťárnu on the Pope:
Jobs recalls in "blue boxes" that sestrojil stevem wozniakem - equipment, which allowed people to hack into the phone companies and free of charge to call anywhere in the world.
On the facilities that have been written in the past are already there, but jobsovo enthusiasm when a blue box describes as an instrument of power, are contagious.
Tells how in wozniakem equipment testovali using paid phone and during the talks were přepojovat from one network AT & T in the other, while using the greatest number of satellites.
"We have at least půltucetkrát propletli have around the world, so if we have something that zakřičeli into buying the phone, ozvalo a minute later from the second phone to the door," laughs at the jobs.
"We were young and we have found that we can build themselves, that is able to manage the infrastructure for the billions of dollars around the world."
They have two, we produced malinkou themselves věcičku, which managed to control the much larger giant - This has been an incredible experience, and I think it would never emerged firm Apple without it.
Jobs description of the response, which continues with almost brought to an end. wozniakem through the blue box call in the middle of the night to the Vatican and asked for it, whether it would be able to speak with the Pope, and best fork out for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually povoláváni increasingly have been the position of the members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, and only just before the phone gave the Pope, the two rozchechtala and sluchátko asked.
As the zamiloval phoned in technology - and with billem hewlettem -:
When he was 12 and Sháněl spare parts that could stand kmitoměr, found in the telephone number on the bill hewletta list and zavolal him.
Not long after their 20minutovém conversation have had jobs guaranteed summer brigádu Hewlett-Packard in society.
"incredibly affected me; it was the only company that I met at the time, and formovala my view of what it actually is, and how to behave in such a society to their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the corporate research labs in Palo Alto, which saw the first table computer, "which was ever produced."
Was big as Kufr, CRT monitor and I was supposed to zamiloval it immediately.
As I began, in my teens in HP moved higher and higher, poflakoval I am around, computers and began to write programs for it.
AS; innovation:
Jobs in several places during the interview, talking about How are inventing new products for a while.
In the beginning of his career, though, has sold a couple of circuit boards, one customer asked him to make up for it the computer.
Available was only paid 30 days, during which he had found, smontovat and add finished facilities.
Later, when he was in the company of apple, recalls the challenges faced in the development of computer mice:
"I remember how we were quite wild arguing... screaming at me, -LSB- that it took five years to build the mouse, which would cost $300, and to me it stops talking, I come out and found designéra."
About ninety days later, we were able to produce perfectly reliable MOUSE FOR $15.
As big companies are breathtaking:
Long before it was a resurgence of apple, jobs foresight predicted that many of the industry leaders in their vision of the zakolísá and lose their share of the market.
"Say that you are working for the companies IBM or Xerox, so you are doing better kopírky or tiskárny well and what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the society society can no longer be more successful.
At this point, no longer reigns, Sales and Marketing, so companies šéfují people who are in charge of it, while the people who are in charge of their own products played off against the decision making process.
Technological genius, which the company took to her unshakeable position, it is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad - zručnost products and technical knowledge is essential.
That is exactly what has happened in the company of Xerox...
Company Xerox could possess virtually the entire computer industry.
Could be ten times bigger than it is, could be Microsoft of the 1990s...
Instead of a victory, however, zadělali for failure.
As it takes innovation as a form of art:
"between a great idea and a great final product is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and as the brilliant idea develops, so, too, is changing and growing."
During that time, a lot of naučíte about it.
You must agree to a series of compromises - some things simply elektrony, glass, robots, or do nepřinutíte plant.
You must bear in mind constantly 5 000 things - different concepts - and there are a total of...
At the end of the day, depending on taste, try to think of the best things that when humanity has called into being, and in a way it is you try reflected in touch of what they are doing.
Picasso said that good artists, but the best artists steal.
I never nestyděl for the fact that I am the best ideas uloupil.
Macintosh company was so great and so successful, that people who work in it, were excellent, artists, musicians, básnící zoologové, historians and, incidentally, also at the same time, the best computer scientists in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, would be wonderful things in quite managed to other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas večeřeli with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case dealt with the Court
On the day when the Supreme Court zasedl behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to order against President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the legal firm, which is before the Court will be part of the negotiations.
The events took place last Thursday, when all of the nine judges gathered to be discussed by the management proposals on the table.
Was one of the probíraných cases action the 26 states zpochybňující a radical overhaul of the Health Care Law, which Congress approved last year - he, which mobilised conservative activists around the world.
Judges agreed they will listen and, in March, however, is expected 5,5hodinové negotiations, the outcome of which is even more rozvíří presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at the time of the decision will be in full swing.
Lawyer, which stands before the Court of Justice and will strive to achieve the rejection of the law, it will most likely Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clementova legal firm, Bancroft pllc, was one of nearly two dozen companies, which helped finance the annual dinner of the federalist society, which has already spent years dealing with the defence of the conservative legal principles.
Another company, which represents one of the trade association dinner has sponsored, Jones day, steadily growing groundswell of opinion challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which are at stake in the huge financial resources.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel room a few hours after the debate on the subject of this case.
In it, among others, as well as Mitch McConnell, the leader of Republicans in the Senate and confirmed opponents of the health care law.
And the guests? scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges, the actions of the federalist society have been engaged in for years.
And certainly it is not anything that would be in line with the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to respect the principles of conduct, which are subject to lower federal judges.
If it was not the case, however, their behaviour would certainly come under the principle of C4, which says that "the judge may be involved in the action, which is related and other organisations hold in order to obtain the financial resources, but the judge can not be honest guest speaker, can not be reported to the action."
However, the relationship scalii and Thomas to two legal firms účinkujícím in case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in the case, more than enough to zalarmoval activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is at odds with several judges, claiming that the Supreme Court is under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of common cause.
"Judges popíjeli and večeřeli on social benefici together with legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss their case before a court of law."
Their presence and help in obtaining funding through this action undermines the feet all claims to the nezaujatosti, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas against its critics have shown little understanding and are told by them that they also combine their judicial duties without any problem with the actions of groups such as federalist society.
Thomasova wife ginni is highly built Conservative campaigner.
Moreover, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly judge Elena kaganová and not scalia with Thomas.
Kaganová worked as the prokurátorka under President Obama, appeared before a court of law, when the first challenge to the law.
Critics of the kaganové pressure on it to repudiate the involvement in the case, and then, argue that the law was so much than that now could be nezaujatá.
Kaganová not nenaznačila that it was about to step down.
Boeing Company won a record contract for proudová planes worth $18 billion
Airlines Emirates order 50 dvouuličkových proudových Boeing aircraft 777 with the possibility of buying the 20 others.
Boeing Company also sells six Boeing aircraft Dreamliner aerolinkám Aman air, for which will collect more than $1 billion.
When a company gets orders to 50 pieces of their products, the majority of it is not a cause for celebration.
If it is, however, the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. company and the cost of these 50 aircraft is put together a record $18 billion, is something else.
As well as the important message is that, too, where the company Boeing won the contract: the Middle East, a burgeoning gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to forecasts published on Monday in the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East over the next 20 years will need 2 520 planes at a cost of $450 billion.
Company Boeing announced its biggest orders at the weekend in history, in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 dvouuličkových proudových boeingů 777.
Sensational contract came from aerolinek Emirates locating in Dubai.
Boeing Company Dubai Air Show AT THE EXHIBITION 2011 said that airlines have the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which would make the total value of the contracts rose to $26 billion.
Boeing on Monday after the company announced that the airlines Oman Air Boeing commissioned six machines 787-8, also sometimes called as a Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and facilities for passengers.
The overall price of one of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent report Boeing for the whole of society," he said Neal dihora, analyst for morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many of the aerolinek těžícím oil in the Middle East is one of tamějším nations.
This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in the price of fuel - most damaging airlines, because it is a matter of some of its biggest costs - is not as critical as the country itself at the higher price of oil money.
This is important, because they are not as likely as in other aerolinek aircraft, that could stornovat or delaying orders because of the increase in fuel prices, dihora says.
"They have natural protection," he says.
Contract from aerolinek Emirates strengthens the position of the company boeaing on the aircraft with a broad tankers and brings in close company Airbus SAS, which I would try to disrupt the dominance of Boeing with its transport model A350.
Boeing victory comes four months after the company Airbus announced that there will be a delay of the first flight of their largest plane A350, which is a direct competitor to the plane 777-300er.
To delay was because customers demanded more utilitarian on the aircraft, and dolet, but why they took the time to allow engine manufacturers add more engine power.
What price action Boeing rose by 1.5% to $67,94.
Sister Mexican President was defeated in michoacánských elections according to all
Luisa Maria calderonová says that its protivníkovi, faustovi vallejonovi from the PRI, help in the Chase for the guvernérským křeslem with drug traffickers.
It seems that the sister Felipe calderona in violent state lost the election to the post of Governor in michoacánu. On Monday, said that one of its opponents to win dopomohli drug traffickers.

"threatened our candidates, members of the group for the poll... zabavovali build the ballot box, road barriers... and people get to vote on the orders of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when a presidency came.
Early, however, plans to return to power, and a victory in the elections in michoacánu is an important step in our efforts to achieve this.
The PRI also hopes to win in the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated calderonovou led, which even the day before the election, only very closely.
Calderonová, candidate for the Conservative Party, his brother's National Action Party, or the vallejona refused to recognise as a winner.
Third, placed the silvano aureolis, candidate for a party Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now has ruled the guvernérský office. rozhádanou and smůlou persecuted religious party, it is a very unfortunate defeat before the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the results to be valid.

Bank ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
Bank Asian Development Bank called on China and India, to be ready to help with the rescue of the euro zone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could lead to the overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the ADB, based in Manila, said that two of the fastest growing economies in the world, "to do everything in their power" to help the rapid recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
Before it, warned that the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and all the problems are "too nevzrušeně" and said that Asian financial assistance, in combination with the European leadership and resources will help to defuse the ongoing collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in this together."
"So fit anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis," he said in the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia is possible, but it is certainly not immune to some extent protected."
"So if China and India can help, it would certainly should have done."
European Monetary unions for several months, it is hard zkoušeno serious debt crisis.
In recent days, and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have increased borrowing costs Italy dangerously resigned.
Raised concerns about the growing debt crisis in Europe that could once again to global economy in recession, and began to call for the newly prosperous leading economies to come together and find a solution to the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid will be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual aid - such as buying bonds the financial bailout of the European Union's institutions for the European Financial Stability Fund - Asian partners of the European countries would provide more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do all it can" to help the euro zone, because its economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and vyschnutím the foreign capital supply.
"No one wants to the euro zone remained unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high growth rate."
"is not an alternative, it is simply a fact, because how else we could find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as the Indian, for example, have nothing to help European economies, if they are forced to face their own severe economic problems.

Warnings from the Pentagon about the potential cuts in defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in Congress work hard under the pot on Monday when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget could threaten national security and cause the financial chain reaction of starting in the Pentagon and continued over the battlefield in Afghanistan to a civilian montážním linkám.
The Pentagon already spend will have to reduce the budget by $450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears about another $600 billion reduction, if Congress can not come to an agreement on spending.
"The Effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire portfolio," Panetta wrote in a letter to the senátorům John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey grahamové, South Karolína.
Said that the failure of Congress to come to an agreement on the budget, and the resulting "attachment to 23% of the decline and the closure of many new projects.
"Because of such huge reductions in something of an imprudent, použitému this way, it will not be possible to make the most of our construction or shipping projects - you can not buy just three quarters, there could be a serious damage to other buildings or ships modernizačních efforts," he wrote Panetta senátorům.
"We will also be forced separovat many of our civilian employees, and because it has a reduction in place so quickly, we will almost certainly have to civilians to send on forced leave, in order to be able to meet the requirements."
"These changes could shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness."
At the end of the day, the cuts will affect the combat troops, Panetta announced.
"Despite this accounts for the financing of possible war in overseas operations, obstávka directly affected, the operation will be negatively affected by serious changes in the other," warned Panetta budgets.
"There will be a cut in the contract staff, which will result in a delay domluvených contracts supporting the efforts of our people."
"reduced stock will be paid employees, of which will come and late payments to suppliers and the subsequent invasion of legal and political support."
Both senators panettovi ten days ago odepsali and asked him about the details of the possible impact on the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of obstávky on Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid degradation of point of view the United States as a global military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this tough measures," the senators said in a joint statement published on Monday afternoon, when panettův letter.
"It's not a conclusion that we live, and it is certainly under him, we do not want to sign."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which should not be allowed to happen."
"It remains to be seen whether the panettův fresh warning letter and will increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and increasing the voices calling for the Pentagon's omission from the list of seškrtaných areas.
Panetta in recent times has been in talks about possible cuts an increasingly open, even though he moved to a high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that takes on the rigid fight.
At a press conference hosted by Secretary of Defense minutý week indicated a brief description of what its portfolio can wait - at the heart of the facade of the army, in which, however, will be missing.
"will be like a ship without sailors."
"As the brigade will be without ammunition."
"as the Air Force will be without trained pilots."
"will be like a paper tiger, an army kasáren, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trénovaných soldiers, who would be able to complete the mission," he said Panetta early in the speech at the Pentagon.
"As a unit will be without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with the possible enemy."
"As a result, will welcome the aggression..."
In the annex forwarded by the letter to McCain and grahamové Panetta details, as will have a reduction in "significant operational risk: the late response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction of výsadků options and deployment around the world; the unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta, adding that some of the biggest defence could wait for the end of the projects, including those that have already been tested, and those that are still in the early stages of planning.
On the list, for example, the plane f35 planned new bombardéru ballistic submarines of the new generation, new littoral combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, which wanted to Army and Marine infantry to replace the Humvee's.
Stopping further development and testing the plane f35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but his supporters argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the army, which is needed to deal with possible threats the country from China and other competitors.
How to identify the lie
One look at the recent headlines suggests how serious and pervasive are lies and deception in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy with the accusations that he sexually obtěžoval Association a few women - both sides claim that the other is lying.
Managers at the University Penn State have been charged with perjury when they tried to hide records about the fact that penzionovaný football coach sexually attacked the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught, as the American president barracku Obama, set off by the microphone says that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is lhář.
Lie can destroy a career zacloumat stability in many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibicionista, Anthony Weiner of itself did hlupáka to disclose information, which were immediately refuted incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of being a chief finance from his campaign to try to conceal their non-marital ratio.
And no one ever will remember the media circus that tore down around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second term in office on a sexual relation with the monicou Lewinsky.
Everywhere, it is full of stories about cheating in school and at the university.
There are cases where teachers themselves to their students testové answers, only to make themselves look good in their reports.
Mentoři who should learn otherwise, send the message that the Lie and fraud is acceptable.
We meet with many fraud?
Studies show that in a single day zalžete somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose that many of them are milosrdné lies.
Another study showed that foreign people during the First 10 minutes of the first meeting of the zalhali three times in their life.
Determining the lies, or "detecting lies," is a skill that everyone should adopt, whether for reasons of personal or labour.
It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to, say, šarádě when one vykřikne: "I am you." detecting deception is serious science sector workers with scientific data collected, over the past six decades at the prestigious universities in the detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been refuted.
Liars, calmly look you in the eye.
This is not the case, that would be zadrhávali koktali, červenali or ošívali.
However, nevyvozujte, from the fact that it is somehow difficult to detect liars zpozorovat and.
školený identifikátor lies can expose right from the větné Construction, Small expressions in obličeji, a way of issues and their timing.
I have spent several years collection of scientific knowledge from a major and emerging sectors on detecting lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skills, which is learning and in today's complex world you can very easily get - especially if your job duties include hiring, holding pohovorů negotiations or the leadership of the people.
Good liars can well read, as well as in the other, they leave the rest in the guard, then channel their emotions and intuitively aware of how the other side accepts.
From the research, we know that extroverti lie more often than introverti that men uttering more sebestředné "lies," while women say more lies aimed at "the other" - mostly in order to protect people's feelings - that ženatí lie less often than Free People to its partners - lies, however, that say, most of them are 'outrageous'.
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, everyone else is feeling less helps no one, if you lie.
As you will see, that someone is lying?
First of all, pozorujte normal behaviour of the body.
This is called "initial observations."
It will make to compare the findings later.
Note holding the body of his ridiculous, work with the voice.
YOU SHOULD KNOW whether someone is constantly poklepává down to illegally neobvinili from it lies just because, as well as the environment of the summit will poklepávat feet.
Then do to shluky false verbálního also neverbálního behaviour.
Take that, however, only as heed the warning signals, rather than as evidence of lies.
People can stop pronášející lie around the upper half of the body, as he tries to remember its vymyšlený story, they can top a film to the gate nahnout, to the east, to significantly change the possession of bodies or expressing relief at the end of the conversation, "" excessive úlevné oddechnutí and a change of location, although it is difficult zpověď behind them.
People involved in giving a false signal that it is often interview at the end of the interview, just to see how it will look like a relief after its completion.
Also vnímejte Language Body.
Great, it is a story of how Scott Peterson once suffered a slip of the tongue and used last time, when he claimed that his zavražděná woman is alive, which rozběhlo nationwide search for her body.
Klamající individuals may also be odměřeně: "the madam... I did not have any sexual relationship with Ms Lewinsky" or the difficult issue of a will.
Most frequent verbal signs are very slim.
Anyone can use a lot of "zmírňujícího language" when it responds to the difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In that kind of answer too facts and will often, it is another warning signal.
There is no appeal, which could detect each lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills, through which we can lie vyslídit.
With these skills will have one more chance, that in a personal and professional buys a liars and podvodníkovi.
Controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be diverted away after a threat of a delay in the approval of the American Government

1 700 miles long pipeline will link Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Albert province to refineries in Texas, proteče 700 000 barrels of oil a day.
This route will be protnout 6 states.
This project absolutely hate, environmentalists, but love Working Party, which it estimated that 20,000 new jobs will appear at work on the pipeline.
Legislators in nebrasce face, however, against this plan and to consider the introduction of laws, which would have forced the company nezasáhnout Sand Hills in the region and to massively damaging sections of ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
Existing studies on the environmental impact, which is objednalo State Department, found that the project will only have a negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry, said that the Inspector General of the Ministry ordered a new investigation of the whole process of the original study, and mainly focused on two issues.
One was that, if a lobbyist najatý society TransCanada, Paul Elliott, that he was in 2008, Hillary Clinton, did not constitute a conflict of interest in the programme.
Further, if the company, which has been najatá inappropriately because it links to the original study, was elected on the company TransCanada.

Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President, to present a new government, which will face a crisis, which holds the country over the brink of economic disaster, which put in danger the entire eurozone.
Presidential Palace issued a report in which announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President giorgiem Napolitano, confirmed to him that it can form a government.

"It is now well vyznačený framework," he added.
Monti has completed the process of government in less than three days, in a much shorter period of time than is usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, because of that, the amount of debt rose to unsustainable levels.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Mario Monti must approve a tough package of austerity measures, which require European leaders and only then will it be possible to restore the nabouranou the credibility of Italy.
On Monti is under great pressure to Pospíšil. Due to the volatility of the markets surpassed the interest rates on Italian bonds btp maturity of 10 years' service 7 percentage point level when Greece and Ireland had to ask for a rescue.

Support for the pdl, the Italian side is important, because until this moment, many of its members opposed the technocratic government majority, which draws up Monti.

Monti's new government must have the strong support of the Parliament, in order to promote the unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could bring a new and a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Association of foreign banks to add to the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.

10 of 22 Spanish football players exceeds 50 international matches.
Only one of the 22 players came to be called up on the side of Costa Rica rises 50 matches.
A huge contrast to the Costa Rica if we compare the 22 players of both countries, who met on the friendly match at 15:05 today at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the masters of the world and Europe's number one of the monthly FIFA ratings, are on its record of classes, and a wide range of mezivýběrových match, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Umana, who as the only true 50 international matches.
This figure reached last Friday in the battle against panamě - 0-2 - to the stadium Rommel Fernández.
Spanish players who play in the game, and in the English league, the powerful clubs keep more than a year of intense activity in the period championships and domestic pohárech league play and matches they at a high level in the European pohárů as champions league.
Also we need to add to the experience of the Spanish national team in the complex vyřazovacích matches on the European and World Championships.
Kostaričtí players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the field, there is a concacaf, for example, which is considered to be the lowest level in the FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign games from the Spanish team is on its record of brankář íker casillas last Saturday, which was England - losing 0-1 in London - dotáhl on former fouled Andoni zubizarreta 126 international utkáními.
Casillas takes today and will receive a new record for Spain - 127 international match against Costa Rica.
Xavi Hernández, a key player Barcelona, has on its record of 106 matches.
Casillas and xavi were even officially a reputation for a UEFA last week along with other Spanish players, who are on their record of 100 matches. zubizarreta between them has already gone 126 and central striker of Schalke, Raul González, 102.
A hundred come closer to the carles puyol with 97 games.
Follow xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés iniesta 62; CESC fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Umana are the left wing júnior Díaz 48 matches and brankář Bryan Ruiz, 45.
On only 5 surpassed the 30 matches: keilor Randall azofeifa with Navas with 31, 32, Michael barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The number of matches.
With fewer than 30 games in Spain are Gerard Piqué 37, Sergio busquets 36, Santiago santi cazorla 32, Alvaro arbeloa - 31 - and Raul albiol - 31.
On the national, with fewer than 30 games is Roy Miller with Winston parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and 26, Roy myrie with 23.
Keep the rest or 20.
While nacho moreal has only four games and Jordi band two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and ólman Vargas and edder Nelson still are waiting for their first match.
David Villa with 50 goals and is the best střelcem Spain followed by Fernando Torres with 27 for him.
On the kostarické, is the most Bryan Ruiz interference, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández, and three more than Roy myrie and parks.

"For the kostariku is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for the Viva, basista Jeff ament from Pearl pits, said that the group is ready to offer one of the best koncertů next Sunday at the national stadium.
We waited more than 20 years, but it assures group that is splněný dream for them to play in Costa Rica.
This basista and founding member of Jeff said ament, who spoke exclusively friendly with Viva from Brazil last week.
On the occasion of the group is on the jihoamerickém continent in the tour 20 years old and 20 will be on the unique zastávce on Sunday in Central America.
This day will come out from 7.30 p.m. at the National Stadium, along with the X andělskou Group and the national players in Las robertas.
This is an act of the interview, which the transcription of you will find on the Nación sites on the Internet.
For your kostarické supporters is a splněný dream.. Do you realise Pearl pits will play in Costa Rica, what are your fans?
For the kostariku is our dream, which is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America, we barely a second time and experience have been great so far.
I was the only one of Costa Rica, on holiday, it is a beautiful country, and I believe that there will be a few days pobýt.
So we are absolutely delighted that we can bring our music you.
I ask, because this group zbožňují, literally, fans are very hard these days of preparation.
What do you say to nejskalnějším supporters?
Thank you, you have stood with us so long for a number of years.
It took us almost 21 years before we arrived at the kostariku. Thank you, that you have waited so long and we regret that it took us so long.
Some people KONCERTU have been talking about as the biggest show of the year.
It generates more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest show that we have demonstrated over the last 21 years, arose in the space of a few weeks.
We have some great show in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we have got into a form at a concert in Costa Rica.
In truth, are looking forward to the concert by power.
Love this country, we would like to serfujeme, like jungle. for both activities, Costa Rica, is the best country in the world.
As you know kostariku and Its waves due to surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfařů and I have a good friend who lives in tamarindo. The waves are incredible.
My friends are surfovat on kostariku or in Nicaragua, or in Mexico, the best place to surfing, and we have learned about the Costa Rica, by people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many of the písněmi.
What you have planned on their presentation in Costa Rica?
In view of the fact that we have never nehráli, we have no restrictions on what we could do.
To show what the best show with diverse skladbami. Will try to play a couple of songs from each band and to give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never neopakujete repertoire.
Why?
I think that this is partly because we have nine ALB and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves the other's, so it is difficult to choose what songs will play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire, which we have not played for a long time, we focus on them, and we are also surprised, because we think on it, why are we so líbily and that we have forgotten to this May.
So it is the show more interesting for us, and that is why I think that it is more interesting for people as well.
This tour slavíte 20 years of artistic career.
If you look back, it is hard to believe, what you have done?
Yes, certainly.
Firstly, I think that none of us could imagine that we will be in a large rock group, and that we will remain in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We know how much we have been given and it moves us, that we can continue to play together.
Do we have to be happy and glad we make music.
We are fortunate that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted.
We could be better.
What mean for you, that you were an important part of the žánru grunge?
Always an honour for us was that we can be part of this group, which is represented by the same velikáni.
People from the Soundgarden mudhoney and Alice in chains are our friends.
It is surprising when there is movement from a group of friends, this does not happen very often.
From time to time there will be in the city, but it is much less common for five to 10 groups coming from one city at once.
We are proud of it and we are pleased that we can be part of a group of Seattle.
Sometimes with some even play.
Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in chains, and we were in Canada, with mudhoney. We are fortunate that we have seen Soundgarden on tour are all our friends and we are pleased that we can be part of the movement that began in Seattle.
Also it is very unusual for the group as yours to keep together and had even after those years are the same Members.
Yes, we have four together for 21 years and Matt - Cameron - join us 13 years ago, which in itself is already much longer than the usual time of group.
I think that, first of all, we are all fortunate that we are still in this world, and secondly, their role is played by the fact that we are always concerned about one another.
We are all close friends and because of this, we have been able to open up the music the way that leave everyone enough freedom to own experimentation.
Each other, we believe we do appreciate music of the second, and I think that it could not be better.
Your relationship to the word celebration was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
As nacházíte balance?
How we rostli was gradually becoming increasingly easier to find a balance.
We are trying to nejezdit too on the tour, because it is very easy to fall into the trap of crowds and the people who love our music.
When you consider that people come for the music, confront is that with music and what you give it, you have to respect. You then you can not be carried away by famous rock stars that neither one of us have never really nezajímalo.
How Mother love bone remember another project?
I think that we are writing great songs and at the beginning, it was something spectacular.
As kapela No Pope an album we get there were three years and we have never been your birth certificate, after umřel Andy - Andrew woods.
It was very frustrating, because it took so long and the most important thing is that, even today, přátelíme with brucem - fairweather - and gregem Gilmore, who started in the kapele with us, I will listen to a song, or if I look at carrying pictures, I remember Andy, it was incredible, as I was with him as nasmál; it was a pleasure to work with him, always laugh, a muzice or talk about football and many others.
It was an incredible person and we lack power.
National kapela Las robertas will be tasked with that launched the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know their work, especially Eddie vedder, and that is why you have chosen is as předskokany?
Yes, production, send us videos with several proposals and this group, we liked the most, which is why we are interested, as Las robertas offer take one, and they must be very funny.
Why always take one you are changing the words of yellow Ledbetter?
This is the question on the EDA - Eddie vedder, so that I do not know.
He words, and I think that makes it the first thing it invades.
As a basistu affects who you?
A lot of people.
As a first I think Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney Chuck dukowski...
There is so much that I could all evening to talk about basistech who I like.
As Pearl pits has managed to keep the grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue?
I think that we have always felt slightly separation from the words of grunge.
To say grunge presenting the group to which I have referred to as mudhoney, Soundgarden Nirvana and all the other, which came at the same time, and if it is even today this music in place, so it is great, because it is something that is worth listening to this music, and groups such as mudhoney play better muziku today than ever before.
At the outset had your music is a bleak character and it is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting, because I feel that in the new albu is a couple of songs, which are lehčího kind, but there are also songs such as the end or juste breathe, which are considered to be very grim, even though they can be as positive.
For both, it is Ed When I played, I cried, and it is deeply dark songs.
I think that when vyrůstáš and is in the life of a trauma, ztratíš someone from the family or friend, these things will influence your art and music, and these two songs for me are just that.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still do pochmurnou muziku.

Park or mountains?
Architects have come together on the occasion of vypsání management, which carries with it more than a debate about the honorářů

Flourish in the 1980s, at the time of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona CMB, the Authority vytiskla several pamfletů in support of the park collserola.
Letáček defined the Mountain as a large fleet of metropolitan Barcelona.
What is more, he was accompanied by figures you with newyorským Central Park.
In 1987, disappeared after CMB Park is back in the minds of many as the upper limit led Barcelona. Catalan capital, is one of the few that do not focus on the axis of North, South, but up - Montenegro - down - sea.
Qualifications collseroly as a natural park is moving in this direction.

This has been the position until September, when city hall announced mega competition consisting of 16 konkurzy on the same number of entry doors to collseroly.

So the only question is: collserola park or a mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisation on the basis of reflection on the city, the issue has become a central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already the subject of just otřelé, such as when the two members of the old caste few at the meeting in the lift lodge hand.
And it is This achievement has caused one of the rare shod between what they think the three barcelonští architects and předstoupivší university professors.
Miguel roldán, Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: selection process makes sense.
Načala issue, according to roldána after the Gulf of Mexico, "There is a need to" discuss, as well as a sign of "mountain," so ildefonse CERDA on green apples dotažen was not in the end.
"We must be based on the principle that nejrozlehlejším barcelonským Park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex, "said the architect, for whom the title" taken into collserola carries with it "lexikologickou trap": "We do not want to is a" as inputs into the park, but rather as a defining zones, where it is possible to act. "
Modol, as well as roldán and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanismu those kvalifikuje proposal as "intellectual challenge" offering "Some danger."
Risk resulting from the "uncertainty, which today is a public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which was in the area Forum its swan "extraordinary."
The first concern is the demarcation of the border, where they should be.
"It means something to do for the next step," is, in principle, to move a step further.
"We need to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current - with the legacy of the PGM general metropolitan plan - can cause a real disaster."
Looking in more detail on the issue, modol believes that údolní svah collserola "can be seen in the park," but not the part of Barcelona, and for reasons of purely topographical.
Modol also remind you that there is already work that has patronat de collserola, which "can not stop on smetišti, even though" welcomes the fact that City Hall offers his grémiu, that in the hit from the first moment. ""
, and understand that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a propustkou, which allows architektům to get involved in the debate, but "Doubt" that it should be just the technical profile, which will lead the multidisciplinary teams - "Is that all the skills, she adds," which is to be developed: "architects should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that has the name of the game, it is difficult, because in the material for the selection process is a global vision collserola: "tender was 16, which apply to all the backbone of mountains - the sea, but there is no podélná study, which would view the area and see it as a whole."
This means that at least he has signed up to all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the one taken may turn on the concept and the definition of an architect of the neighbouring gates.
City Hall, in his view, should guarantee that the zone, just over the Ronda de Dalt should ensure in the entire length of the zone equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens.
Casino prominul jonási larrazábalovi, which will be released
After 72 days of Legal Representative cadino red grant mercy brother Mayor of Monterrey in the process, in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel jonás larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and now he will be released after the legal representative casino red, mercy before the Criminal Court in the constituency, which debated the case of blackmail, in which he was charged brother Mayor of Monterrey.
Following the assassination of Casino Royale owner casina red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos, in which Manuel jonás after it had to pay the economic quotas, the municipalities in Monterrey allowed illegal operation in the sázkovém House.
After the public indictment of the state prosecutor has launched a criminal prosecution of the brother panistického mayor on 2 September was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then before the agent of Public Ministry number after 4 hours, 3 for property crimes he was taken to the prison, located in the barrio 1 antiguo in the capital of the state.
At this point, the next 49 days after other regulations to imprisonment and the agent was made public to rebut the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
He was taken to the criminal court in the cadereyta on 19 October on suspicion of blackmail of casina red with one and a half million peso, but has only a few hours in a heavy medium supervision because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allow him during the process remain in urban in San Nicolás de los Garza row.
25 October has been submitted to the order to arrest him, which issued a second criminal court, Jorge yánez Secretary General, who said that for nearly two months of investigations, with enough evidence to show jonásovu blame. evidence include, for example, the amount of 1.5 million peso of casinos in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed.
On Monday this week, the legal representative casina red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judges, José Luis pecinovi and ask for mercy for brother Mayor Region, on the basis that it will soon be able to return to freedom.
During legal proceedings, a representative of the Ministry allocated to this Court, Ramiro Arias, who ask if Garcia gómeze, have been restored and damage from Associates has decided to give the Mercy. lawyer, but made it clear that the name will remain confidential.
On the basis of an official dossier 197/2011 grants legal mercy jonási larrazábalovi. In the process, which has been conducted, it will not be possible to make any complaint against him, and it is not possible to ask for the compensation of the damage or death.
After the trial, the legal representative of 15:50 court ordered the immediate release of the larrazábala bretóna.
Secretary of the Court, Jorge yanéz, coming to the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to jonásovi, announced that he had been granted an official pardon operations and his case has been postponed until archives.
Also announced that the judge has issued an immediate regulation him on his release.
Secretary of Dionisio Pérez jácome presented details on air accident, in which the Secretary of the Governor, Francisco Blake, and the other seven people.
Secretariat for communication and transport - SCT - reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people show that the helicopter turned out directly to the terrain full force, without a pilot had a chance to try a forced landing.
At a news conference Dionisio Pérez jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the start of the aircraft pilot, said that weather conditions for years.
"Part of that, there are several times, suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain, with the zapletla wing in the branches of trees 25 metres from the place where the unit lost trup."
Also reported that The unit was intended for the 19 people, therefore meet all the requirements for the transportation of personnel.
Moreover, said that on the basis of investigations carried out in the area crashed, were found on the ground no components.
"in the search for, it was found that parts of the aircraft it has not included in another place, so the plane hit on the mainland as a whole.
"helicopter was designed for the 19 people, meets all the requirements to transport people.
Terrain, the svah prone seven to 30 degrees.
Secretary assured that, at the moment, the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible, but the investigation could take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto Lopez Meyer, General Director of airports and auxiliary services, said that in turn crashed near cruise speed with the helicopter's general staff and the accident occurred on the soft vzestupném ground.
"This supports the hypothesis that the information in the time of the accident, it was a přeletovou operation," he said.
Representatives at a press conference SCT Pérez jácome listed six fundamental points of Investigation:
Visual years:
In line with the air standards was years implemented under visual flight rules, this means that, during the flight crew must see the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reporting in aicm indicates adequate conditions at the start, in accordance with the plane is moving towards the border, between DF cloudburst in low height and the state of Mexico were evident classes.
The route:
It is likely that because of the cloudburst crew sought a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
The impact.
Souřadnice helicopter crashed and the last entry of the radar agree, it is likely that a nárazem there has been a loss of control, or to interfere with flight trajectory.
No remains of the plane in a limited area:
Information, which we currently have available, allows us to assume that the crashed occurred to equal the trajectory and from the side.
Nákres rozptylu residues, suggests that at the time of impact to the land was helicopter holistic.
Fire or explosion was recorded.
No evidence was recorded on the site of the disaster, which would be in on the fact that there was an explosion or fire.
The results of the investigation show that could be a few contacts with the continent.
During the field work of aircraft in the above have been found to 9200 feet above sea level, svažuje terrain, the tendency is from seven to 30 degrees.
Photos show the footage, in which there was likely to break up along the route.
Information provides elements, which, as it turns out, indicate that the helicopter could come into contact with the country in a few places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, was found on the territory, which is larger than the set, vestiges of helicopter, which strengthens the assumption that the crashed occurred in condition when the helicopter was more holistic.
Mexico's Health Insurance Institute began research gene, which causes obesity
Health Insurance Institute is conducting research to discover a gene responsible for obesity children and adolescents research has been supported by experts from the Institute IPN.
Mexico's Institute of Health insurance - IMSS - announced that leading research in order to identify a gene causing obesity in children and young research entitled "genetics of obesity in children and adolescents." will make it possible to obtain the results of the overweight.
In the research report medical units in the area Biochemie from specialty hospitals of the National Medical Center of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it was set up a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, Nutrition experts and social workers.
The team is based on the support of specialists and pupils postgraduálního study from the National Institute of public health - Insp - and from the center of research and Advanced Studies - cinvestav - National polytechnického Institute - IPN.
To participate in the research as well as the general public, who may or nemající authorisation, and people can come to participating in sports centres IMSS in the Valle de Mexico City, where it will be any soboru from 8 hours to carry out tests teenagers.
Pointed out that the research began in the sports centre Cuauhtémoc - Mexican state - and from 8 October, this activity is also in the sports centre nezahualcóyolt - east of the state.
Once obtained data from 500 to 600 children, will be the study will continue in the sports centre Independencia - South of the Federal distriktu - and at the end of the day, in a sports centre Morelos - North from the federal centre.
Explained that the purpose of this research is to identify the components and the importance of genetics, with regard to the development of obesity risk factors, and traced to Mexican children and young people and by preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, celebrated on 14 November, reminded us that the aim is to collect data from three thousands of children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for application specific forms about nutrition.
Questionnaire will also ask for physical activity and family powerful track record hereditary diseases in order to avoid the risk factors, which could cause diseases such as diabetes or ledvinová inadequacy.
Sure, that every Saturday, all of the participants are antropometrická measuring weight, height, district passport, measured the blood pressure, determines the level of glucose monitors, trigliceridů, cholesterol, inzulínu and examined the genes - to try to identify genes that are implicated in child obesity.
Cruz Lopez, said that the research reflects the concern of health workers on the alarming rise in children's weight.
'health also carried out there between 1999 and 2006, showed that in just six years, only for the boys to a 77% rise in obesity and for girls to 47 percent. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of overweight', an expert from the IMSS said.
Said that one of the reasons for the indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from the rest of their genetic history.
Reported that the average mexičan, 65% of indiánsko-americké genetic toolkit, 30% of the EU, and 5% of African and this fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the weight and diabetes.
Explained that in general the genetics of obesity is routinely explains persist as a failure to burn down on excessive energy, which - calories - and eat which carries in the form of fat.
Scientist explained that a direct benefit lies in the fact that the participants receive an overall assessment of the state of children in order to find out if they have any known overweight or obesity.
Said that even the presence of vrásek dark colours - acantosis - to the neck and předloktí indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer metabolickými problems and předcukrovkovými conditions.
Information is still confidential, doctors it in writing to parents and explain them all the measurement and changes in lifestyle, which they must take to avoid diseases to their children.
Cruz Lopez, explained that there are three main components that are overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle constituting the lack of daily physical activity, a day's vysedávání in front of the television and the use of vehicles instead of walking over short distances.
Overweight is also a big kalorický income, it is more of slazených drinks, uhlohydrátů - tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgry, etc. - high in fat and protein and the genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.
In the asphalt of the UNAM will not výmoly
Rafael Herrero, a scientist from the chemical school UNAM creates modified asfalty with polymery and creates a mixture with better functionality, independently of the climatic conditions and a temperature
If the right pečovalo on nearly 200 thousand dláždění, there would be no need to be repaired výmolů after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of Valle de Mexico City, Rafael Herrero nájera pointed out, the scientist from the chemical school - FQ from UNAM, which at the same time, adding that if the construction and maintenance of a parking dláždění was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of výmolů, or even they might be completely eliminated.
In his přednášce technological cause výmolů, which made in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that laboratory under his leadership is modified asfalty with polymery, which should rise to mix with similar characteristics, such as asfalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resistance, both in the low, at high temperatures.
Herrero nájera believes that this kind of modified asfaltů could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some of the cities in the north of the country and improve the functionality and would reduce the creation of výmolů.
Explained that asfalt, the most difficult part of the oil is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, with a great molecular, referred to as asfalteny molecules, and the other with a low molecular, who call themselves the malteny together add asphalt with viskoelastický character.
Viskoelastický nature of asphalt lies in the fact that the high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acts as tekutina in 120 degrees viskozitu is high, and in almost 50 degrees is in solid shape, while at low temperatures asfalt tends to lámat, he added.
This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but during the day it is according to the weather conditions and temperature, a chemical engineering expert pointed out.
Scientist from the chemical school observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico City is covered by a flexible dlažbou, which is made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asfaltem.
Among the nejsvrchnějšími classes are asfaltová vložka, consisting of a small kamínky zalitými in the asphalt, and then stlačenými.
Stress that each block, which is made up of vložku, it is zalit asfaltem.
In the passage of cars or in terms of the pressure, it is possible that the forces in the ditch well unravel.
If it was a modified asfalt unravel would be even better, believes the chemical engineer.
Add that on the asphalt vložku place last class called cry, consisting of a fine stones, pískem also zalitým in the asphalt.
In view of the fact that this class will come into contact with ráfky vehicles must be more mechanical power than asfaltová vložka and must ensure the friction roadway.
In view of the fact that, as part of the dláždění will be subject to great burden, must have the mantle of sufficient tloušťku and must be careful in the material from which it is zhotoven.
Climate, especially vlhkost and temperature changes, they are also very important factor, which is something to bear in mind, especially water has had a huge impact on the functionality of asfaltové vložky.
Once the terrain is vlhký water spread inside and it is difficult to get out, and that causes softening all levels of dlažby and the emergence of výmolů.
Explained that during a výmolů as the first poničí film pláště and only when there is damage to the asfaltové vložky. But does not damage in one moment, but it is a gradual process, which should stop at the first signs of the appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the national system, scientists also explained that the burden is another important factor in creating the výmolů vehicles, and that is why tloušťka each layer dlažby must respond to the burden of vehicles and must ensure that the burden below that is the only way we can prevent many of výmolů.
Rafael Herrero, pointed out that when it comes to asfalt, once we have a lot of work and research is at the beginning, it is worth noting, for example, asfaltové emulze in other countries, which are already available on the market and allow easily repaired výmoly without having to use a high temperature.
What did the ticket of Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez serna win korunku Miss Colombia.
Valle receives 14 title of the first vícemiss.
Valle del Cauca again reached on korunku Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez serna had to be content with the fact that is at a podiu vítězek, won a silver korunku and šerpu, on the basis that has become the new first vícemiss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final and won in the cartageně, in which žezla took Miss Atlántico, the département won 14 and the title of the first vícemiss. Melina join the zástupům women of the Valle del Cauca, who came close to winning korunce but, at the end of the day, the first was called vícemiss; these include Miriam ospina Benoit 1947, Clara Domínguez borrero 1949, Patricia Bellini Ayala - 1979 - Lorena Álvarez 1981, Rosa Mary alzate 1983, Olga María arenas 1987, Leila blanque 1988, Mónica Evers 1989, María Consuela Pinedo 1990, Diana Isabel Romero 1993, Mrs Garcés aljure 2000, Catalina Giraldo 2007, Stephanie Garcés aljure - 2008.
The question, that many are asking: What did?
As a result, the defeat of the great favoritky, which in all the previous rounds has shown that it has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and nejhezčí face. joile de volgue these titles, such as taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, which have subsequently odnesly the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury decided to name only the first vícemiss, is the fact that it is not convinced by his answer to the question: "which paper you liked the most, and why?," asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of literary editors leamos.
On the issue of she replied:
"I read a lot and I very much hope in the role of literature, I believe that this is one of zkulturňování. knížka, which has the most influence in childhood," the little prince, "was very deep paper.
At the present time, I read "Crime and Punishment." It is a book that is part of the global literature, that we should all know., and today I have with me a book from Irene nemirovski Russian the authors. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre."
Admittedly, the answer is liked, both because of the deadline, one "culturize" and secondly, because it has not been list clarified, the individual the paper marked her.
After the formal ceremony Melina has said that it is on hold and is pleased with the outcome: "The world is wise, what is going to happen, it will happen.
And you people, čtěte little prince is a wonderful book, if you will. "
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorita.
Bogotský journalist suggested that the fact that she was from the beginning of the most popular nejoslavovanější and gastronomická challenge that drew all previous prices OSTER, the title of the public as the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother, gave rise to envy other uchazeček vystresovalo Queen, which then has failed on the stage.
This was evident in the first presentation of the plavek on the beach hiltonu a coronation and during the final two přehlídek. A
Even when both zářila, it was noticeable that lacked the strength and enthusiasm, which demonstrated reprezentantky from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio journalist programme "as" at home to Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first vícemiss confirms the fact that list, which during the competition will receive the most titles at the end of the day, neodchází with korunkou Queen. "
Moreover, Valle held more nevlídný attitude to the media in recent days and not pay for it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince porotu about his interest in social work, which are at the heart of the national competition beauty.
Only on the margins of international member of men, two days before the election, Luca Doughty said that searching for the woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country.
"in the competition Miss Colombia beauty by itself is not enough, we need to see something more than just a physical beauty. There is a need to focus on the social conscience and it is important that the candidate before entering the competition, have been involved in such projects," explained.
Also speculates that the list of the Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibróze, which has been the zadečku visible. But this is entirely at odds with the verdict of men, which they chose miss "natural beauty" and responsible for the healthiest body, a healthy diet physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco which Queen preparing, acknowledges that the Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrózou to step up zadečku, which in my view did not see too much on the part, she stepped down points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from magazine cromos believes that rodačka from Valle made a mistake when they undergo a surgical procedures.
"surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle wrong with them.
Body was never her strong side and we chose its tax. "
Because of this award, which the National Assembly for the first time udělovalo beauty, to have taken place in plavkách cruel predictions that the honor, said that this was a satisfying, which raymundo melině given that it will have at the end of the day, to the highest korunku.
Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina today, started the year of panování, not as the queen, but as a princess, from a position that allows it to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where the national competition will be appointed.
Go down in history as one of the queens, however, that despite the strhujícímu success in cartageně TO THE HIGHEST korunce falling.
That was the work of the people Cali, which identified the corpse Alfonse Cana
An expert on fingerprints in history as the man who came from Cali confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana. ""
Work of these officers is crucial.
On November 4 last year, an expert on fingerprints of honor in Cali came in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the FARC, "Alfonse Cana, and by comparing fingerprints."
Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who work on the separation of the honor this week, it was the turn of the eliazar González, men in the Puerta tejada, 21 years working in the area of research.
At the beginning of their careers González worked in the municipalities in the Chocó, where he had often struggle pralesem more than five days to get to a place where they were walking, which needed to be identified.
In 2000, the přemístil in capital of Valle and then, what was the rates to specialize in fingerprints. This science is the subject of a skin friction, dlaní hands and feet.
In the week, when it was being carried out operations against the alfonsi canovi eliazarovi said, to take the clothes with them at least three days.
Expect something great.
On Friday night pause in Cauca in a helicopter from palmira.
Know that it will have to identify two bodies and that the podezřívá, that one of them is the man who led the world's oldest guerillu, asked him to take card with the fingerprints of Guillermo leóna sáenze - his real name.
However, when he came with the investigating team to a place where it was mrtvola, nepoznal because of the Physical Appearance and seemed quite differently than in the media.
As vesničan, did not vousy oblečený was in the area, without glasses, a much leaner.
It's not lie.
Along with the galtonovou lupou, inkoustem and transplantátorem and light eliazar to compare the daktylové walking papers from card records.
An eye it does not fall short: it was "Alfonso cano."
The same night the man originally from Puerto tejada was charged, the Minister of Defense to juanu Carlos pinzónovi, confirmed that it was indeed a top FARC commander.
Finding traces
For daktyloskopa from sijín de Cali is the recognition that eliazarovi González, President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference the operational services against canovi "very significant."
A lot of people do n't know our work.
Daktyloskopie is an exact science, without the possibility of mistakes, which can play a key role in deciding the offences.
In addition to the identification of corpses to these people in the research of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of people caught.
If they are caught, Many offenders presented false documents or have no paper at all.
We retire fingerprints and looking for them is in the database.
Investigator told that, in case of injury, he had in the House to remove a piece of the wall of the house, because at this point, a thief is based, to vytáhl trezor full of jewellery and money.
Walls are difficult, because they are not designed to collecting of, but in this case, we could have a mark on the hand and identify the perpetrators, who was involved in a number of krádežích, "recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspect in the case of murder.
Recently found the dead man with the lahvemi alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation found that responsible for the murder, could be one of the family members and mark on the láhvi really confirmed it.
Even though is not absolutely confirm that a murderer, it is clear that came to the scene of the crime.
Expert on the fingerprints of honor to explain that the objects are prints of "blurred by chemical or physical reaktivních substances."
When there are, as well as for their collection is transplantátor or the tape.
Then they would be sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or registraturu.
"The problem is that at the present time, there are still many kolumbijců, whose data are not listed anywhere," said an expert from the honor.
Explained that not everything is the same as in the television programme CSI shows.
As well as all that třpytí, not gold, not at all what the dotknete, traces remain.
However, if it can be used, it needs to make the comparison.
"indignation" protest in New York
Hundreds of manifestantů tísnily zuccotti, where they wanted to stanovat in the square.
A large proportion of those waiting at the behest of the dismantling of the area and transferred to the Middle Park.
Members of the movement obsaďte Wall Street they had provoked on Tuesday, representative of New York, when a court order to once again be in the square were pulled back from Manhattan, this morning and then tried to pull another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestantů tísnily zuccotti in the square, where we wanted to get to the court order, which allows "resentment" to return stanovat on místi. The second part of the movement responded to the dismantling by worked park in the north of the city, where there have been other arrests.
"If the US Court not to return to the square, usadíme in another place, and we will continue in the legal battle to return to zuccotti, through the Assembly, as well as a peaceful demonstration," said one of the speakers "Wall Street," obsaďme mark Bray movement.
Bray specifies that "outraged" response to the eviction of the camp, which ordered, the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has come to court, Where a Judge Luca Billings issued an order that banned violent eviction of jobs and allow manifestantům in order to continue to stanovali here.
In addition, "indignation" zabrali and other park umístěný at the crossroads of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, in the vicinity of entry into the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the plot fary in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to do the job instead, but then came the police and arrested some of the manifestanty. Bray knew the exact figure, but said that he had seen that the muzzle, some of the journalists.
Organization assures that on the ground have set several hundred people; there were also the religious leaders to express support for them and also trying to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile zuccotti square, which is private property, remains closed, and expects the negotiations, which should be just on Tuesday, and during which should analyse the morning of the evacuation.
Some of přemístěných manifestantů even distributing and rozdávali copy of the court order and is even giving the Nationals, who defend the square, which has caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers manifestanty beat.
Court order prohibits authorities evacuate members of the movement "Wall Street" ocupa or use the "laws, which were published after the conquest, or ban began manifestantům access to the park in shops, or in other places, which used to have."
Mayor Bloomberg said that for the press, given that the court order the city has suspended once again open public space and manifestanty pointed out that the local laws do not allow them to return to the tents and spacáky.
The leader of personally defended the morning zuccotti square in operation, in which they were detained on 200 people and to which it has been handled, because manifestanti "have infringed the law."
Bloomberg explained that ordered the evacuate square because there "The place to which people nechodili protest, but ubližovat other violations of laws and, in some cases," because "some of the shops are threatening letters" and "neighbours are worried about the quality of their life."
"The Morning the dismantling was appalling, and it shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of American working people," a spokesman for the movement, which accused the mayor, that "We appreciate freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Wall Street" ocupa also said that they plan to organise a "great action" on Thursday, in cooperation with the komunitními and trade unions, to just two months after that last protests; they have started on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be pannu Maria in special Christmas TV agenda
Along with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians appear in the television programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Kanaďanka Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tima allena in "home improvement," plavčíkem in "Baywatch," zajíčkem in Playboy ', "he rokového hudebníka Tommy Lee and will now herečka and modelka pannou Maria in special Christmas on Canadian television.
A private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the zpěvákem sentimentálních songs Michael Bublé and other major Canadians appear in the television programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas on 1 December and will represent the pannu Maria."
CTV today showed footage of the television programme, in which Anderson, also known for the domestic pornographic images, will come with her former husband, the engine of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy leem, as heads of Mario holding in jesličkách panenku representing Santa Claus.
As Joseph Peters will appear on the stage, a Canadian comedian indiánského origin, who recently served as moderátor on tour, "We violent torpedo of truth Charlie Sheena."
Krome Anderson and peterse will appear in a special Christmas broadcasts CTV Canadian famous singer Bublé, which at the end of March oženil in Buenos Aires with Argentine fashion model luisanou lopilato, and which is close to the controversy.
Bublé recently called američanku Kim kardashian at one of its koncertů in New York "liškou."
Japan after the devastating earthquake comes back to life
GDP has grown by 1.5% thanks to the household consumption and this is the end of a period of airplane, which started in March
Japan's economy from being paralysed since March last year, are now recovering from the devastating earthquake, which přerostlo nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in that country had to face since the Second World War.
The initial estimates of tokyjské governments have quantified material losses at 300 000 million dollars, blow, which is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After the three quarters airplane, the value of GDP between July and September, in a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive effect: GDP rose by 1.5% as compared to the previous quarter, and by 6% a year.

The stronger currency are products more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of major technological groups.

Athens again spreading insecurity
Papadimos says that the austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives nepodepíší no written commitment
With the rapid and risk as marginal and uncertainty, which once again prevail, Greece is still more zaplétá into a maze, which leads to the output from the debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that "Consensus" new transitional Greek Government is given the demands of Brussels, rather than a genuine belief of the political forces, is starting to keep up.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days, which came on his nomination, will probably be short for their application, the President of the conservative New Democracy Party, antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures, in any case, support and has reiterated its call on the expected date of 19 February vypsání new elections.

The Conservatives went in his speech to the EU and the IMF a bit far. 8 billion, which Athens urgently need these organisations have unblocked. but at the same time, he said, that support and would not sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission 'incensed by the impact, which caused Papandreou games with the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are red lines: neodblokuje no help, if the new government and the leaders of the main parties WO N'T THEY "notable for a written commitment without ambiguities and as soon as possible."
Spokesman for Economic Affairs, amadeu altafaj, explained that the troika of "very soon" in Athens and will return to negotiate with the new government about what it needs to pay, "the sixth of 8 billion. But there is no definitive date."

CDU proposes to elect the President of Europe on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party angelu Merkel was in lipsku the first day of the Congress on Monday 14 November the Christian Democratic Union - the CDU.
The issue of the future of Europe initially was not on the agenda, but it has become, in the autumn, particularly to be uspokojeni party members, who consider the policy of the government today to the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow against the Italians for lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission, from was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
Angela Merkel's několikaminutové standing ovation at the end of the speech, and then a few hours later, very pro-European finance minister, Wolfgang schäubla have left room for doubt.
The idea of The Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: Europe's response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more."
Not only is that Europe is peace, but because of the "Nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "it is time for change."
That could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty allowing fiscal policies to strengthen control over European Union member countries of the euro zone, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, "in order to give Europe a face."
In any case, that is one of the ideas the proposal adopted by Congress, which is inspirátorem clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries to agree on this revolutionary move quickly: is opposed by Britain and the leaders of the CDU, think that the same approach will also Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is vytýčen.
As well as the delegates rejected the proposal by a large majority to appreciate the weight of each country in the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Held concern to the climate within his own party, she made several references to the Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. but did not try to obtain Congress talk of the "small" European states or on the States that are in trouble, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the proposal for Europe to one paragraph of the importance of Angela Merkel, France failed to quote "Franco-German friendship."
Only indirectly.
When reminded that just two hundred years ago, in lipska bloody battle.
In fact it was one of the most pokořujících slaughter Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in sick?
After subsidies spouštějí UMP party and the government offensive against the labour neschopnostem.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux, and visits the office for the provision of social support, from where prosloví speech on the subject of the year 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an escort of the offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but it is no less clear from the point of view of the presidential campaign, the majority of the right wants to concentrate on the sick.
First of all because of budgetary savings the Government intends to impose on fourth day of a private sector employees before the start taking support in the disease.
Clearly, without the consent of the company would be an employee, who is ill, lost four days wages, so at least 15% of their monthly income.
Measures to create a lot of bad blood, but that risks, according to the forest Echos may bring about 280 million euros.
And also the measures, which would be accompanied by other measures symbolic impact: to give government employees a day nehrazené sick - until now have no failure over three days in the private sector.
While these issues are also under discussion, the majority of the right it triggers theme of fraud aimed to abuses linked with the labor neschopnostmi this time.
Controls will be much larger, and: "If you get caught, you will be back," Xavier Bertrand pointed out in an interview RTL individual granting station on Sunday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seems somewhat disproportionate to the truth of the nepravostech in job neschopnostech.
These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught of that bear fruit.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Stopping first on the official figures.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie - CNAM - State health insurance companies - compensation has been paid out in 2006, more than 237 million euro daily.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the health sector represented the compensation in 2008, with its 11,3 billion euro 5% of expenditure on health care.
Of that amount to 46% of the concerned parent contributions and accidents and 54% of related to the failure, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
So only 2.5% of the costs of health care.
According to the study of the old consulting should the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 days of disability from 17,8 days in 2009.
Average, which holds some variation: a different Anketa published in the 2007 on the website of dealing with job opportunities monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said that they nevybralo no sick day.
Another study, this time by nemocenského insurance institutions, specifies that in the 2010 37,8% of the failure was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15% from 1 to 15 days within 1 month, three months and 11% took longer.
When it is compared to their European neighbours, French workers are more prone to work neschopnostem than elsewhere.
One long study by two researchers in 2010 CNRS 'National Research Centre showed that between 1994 and 2001 overall absence - for health reasons or not - has alternated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% in France and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in job neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the work on the black market.
When it comes to fraud, these are just small scale.
Strengthen legislation since the 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks aimed at working the failure of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM stated that 1.5 million in checks was 13.8% for the 285,000 carried out because of the short neschopnostem "wrong or too long," i.e., 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled the failure of longer than 45 days, napočítalo 11% of the cases, "nepřizpůsobených or ineligible to 1.2 million, i.e. the 132 000 controls."
A total of 169, 000 'unjustified' cases for several million employees, who were working a failure.
Figure, which is much less than the number of work on the black market.
According to a member of the UMP Dominique tiana, author of The June report on this issue, this figure would represent a 9 to 15 billion euros of missing in collecting taxes for the year, which is more than the total amount of daily allowances and so infinitely more than fraud related to the above.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy again.
On Monday, 14 December said this speech before Parliament, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos and add that one hundred days of his government of unity will be enough to meet this challenge.
"To stand on its feet again our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue the financial plan," said the head of the Government, when pronášel on Wednesday, its first public speech at the opening of the debate on a confidence vote in Parliament.
Implementation of the decisions taken by the 27 October in the euro zone would be "the main task of the new government," because what is at stake is the participation of our country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, the country Papademos projected that the deficit will be from the teďka until the end of the year "in the area around 9% of the gross domestic product" after he had been 10,6% in the 15,7% in the 2009 and 2010.
Right rejects new austerity measures

"No new measures to hand nezvedneme," New Democracy Samaras pointed out in a meeting with members of the board.
We agreed the targets on reducing the deficit and debt and the fight against waste, but we are opposed to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
The ollimu Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU neodblokují needed 8 billion Euro loan without the written guarantees of all parties, which support the measures envisaged antonis Samaras replied that his word is enough, and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the commission of experts
According to a report by the Royal Society of Canada, have been Canadians excluded from death.
The palliative care Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions for health and doctors are working together to ensure that the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.
Canadian company with the idea of death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accepts the opportunity to talk with a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and makes decisions in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report Royal Canadian companies, which contributes six experts working in various areas, including that of a Ethics, Law and medicine.
The Commission recommends the government to change the law so that dovolovalo assisted suicide and euthanasia, jeví-li this election as necessary for patients deemed competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of experts cite a recent independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which polled, compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada Place in 10th place, the study notes that "medikalizace death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medikalizace yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire to die at home, which has a majority of Canadians, 68,6% of them die in the hospital.
The average pay for the whole of Canada, while in the province was being constructed, the figure is the highest, with 86% of people dead in the hospital.
When it comes to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report, come to conclusions, which run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to the experts, who also carried out all of the countries where these approaches are legalised control or are not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that any abuse in the application of this odkriminalizování causes, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide for people nepříslušné or nesouhlasící.
P instead. Jocelyn downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday when telekonferenci more than the numerous cases of these mistakes were legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide are not just in countries where.
"Euthanasia is performed, as well as in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted Suicide is performed, as well as in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn downie.
The Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to the investigation conducted by the Forum Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already, in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that will allow people at the end of life to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalisation of euthanasia, does not mean that we are sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people has a lower price.
When it comes to people who have assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that it should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or interruption of care for the patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also on the list of their recommendations suggest that the criminal law said that withdrawal from the treatment, for which there is a legally sanctioned rejection, is not a crime.
The commission of experts also requires specialist doctors were educated to a duty to refuse medical treatment at the end of life without it, that they were afraid of criminal prosecution.
The palliative care Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions for health and doctors are working together to ensure that the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.
At the end of the day on the paliativního or final defuse the already widely used in the Canadian Medical Equipment, the Commission is calling for it to be seen at the moment when the serve to reduce physical pain for euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Other experts reservations
Some experts on medical law already have expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, medical law specialist, described the position of expertů-signatářů report as "extreme" among other things, that does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be unaven life, which should more than 18 years of age, he could ask for help to commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who study the résumé report yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks as though the authors of the report were autonomy of the people above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
As there are in society, "says, heed the warning signs and restrictions."
Specialistka medicínského Justice Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which kvalifikovala as a" manifesto for euthanasia. "
Margaret Somerville doubt, which itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, especially on the dates of the report on the lack of errors in some countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, that is, in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.

Every year by 2017 the structural deficit will have to fall on the 0,75% of gross domestic product - GDP - and starting with the year 2017 the structural deficit every year, the federal state will not be allowed to 0.35% of GDP, while the country, as well as the Community, they will have to have a balanced budget.
To get in a matter of years 2020/21 public debt below 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in the foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister yošihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene in foreign exchange markets, once again if he was only continue to strengthen.
"We intervene, as we did the last time, if we find excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen," explained the Senate Y. Noda.
Once again on Tuesday has risen to the historic values that 31 October by Japanese authorities to intervene.
That day sold Tokyo yen for dollars, in order to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently overcome record against the dollar, in force since 1945.
But since then, regularly purchases rose encouraged investors, who see it as a "safe haven" in times of uncertainty the world economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar on Tuesday again came under 77 yen, and the euro has fallen below the symbolic level of 105 yen close to levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009 had more than 160 yen the dollar value of around 120 yen and the euro.
This outbreak of the Japanese currency is ostrovnímu exports, because getting increasingly expensive cost of products made in Japan, and reduces the value of profits získávaných Japanese companies from abroad when it is translated into the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering from zkáz" caused by the March earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the region tohoku Y. pointed out in the north-east of the country, Noda, who fears that this expensive yen nezabilo even in eggs the fragile recovery.
Third World economic power restored in the third quarter - growth of 1.5% due to the předešlému this quarter and for the first time in one year due to a growth of exports and household consumption with disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen nereflektovala "Japan's national economy."
Announcement Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called the Japanese central bank action, which started on Tuesday, a two-day meeting of its political and Monetary Council, to take all possible measures leading to weaken the yen.
But víceguvernér this institution hirohide yamaguči pointed out, that the fight had earlier take "adequate measures" to suggest that any Additional monetary weakening is expected on Wednesday.
In their last meeting at the end of October Institute for emissions of securities increased by 47 billion euros - the 5.000 billion yen - its purchases of Treasury bills and increased amounts of The 519 billion euros 55.000 billion yen the ceiling, which pays for purchases of various securities to flood with likviditami.
The euro area:
Rates are rising, stock Markets Fail
Risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of governments in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth numbers in France and Germany, and weaker countries continue their growth rates.
European stock markets are still worried about the stability of the euro area today on Tuesday, 15 November falling into negative expectations.
In Paris in 10 hours CAC 40 Index lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
DAX index in Frankfurt lost 0.1% 0.4%, and in London.
"with new tensions around the proceeds from loans to countries of the euro zone, which are also in trouble, with stock markets around the world continue to pay only part of the recent gains."
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, makléř IG markets commonly cited by Reuters.
Stock market was closing with a drop of 0.7% in Tokyo, which has suffered because of concern among market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan as well as the rest of the world has only have eyes upřené on Europe and exchange will continue in a narrow corridor variations, while investors do n't have evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates mitsušige Akino, fund managers in the ichiyoši Investment management.
This the relaunch of the uncertainty over the future of the euro area to the currency, which on Tuesday, continues its decline.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
The European currency in 10 hours in the value of the dollar 1,3570 decline of 0.4%.
According to stockbrokers currency inexplicably back-pedalled after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU Party at its Congress on Monday adopted a proposal that incorporate the possibility to leave the euro zone for the countries that find themselves in trouble, so it would not have had to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6%
Interest rates on the loans in Italy and Spain are at a very alarming rate.
On Tuesday, the Italian 10-year bonds this morning is 6,85% and the return of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions working at interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continues to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti strongly demanded time to markets in order to correct the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by the size of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken by the 27 October in the euro zone would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate přímce markets, when we have elections to the House on Sunday in the country.
Rates' spread 'difference between desetiletými appeasement places of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of the oznamujících eurozone growth figures
Statistics say that France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter due mainly household consumption, which is a little bit better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, France's National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revising downwards the figures for the second quarter on a drop of 0.1% of GDP rather than stagnation.
And the truth is that of the fourth quarter, which economists worried about most.
From its side of the Germany registered growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission has just draw attention to the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must win over dogma
If there is an issue that can not be approached on the basis of the balance sheets or under the emotions, then it is energy policy.
Disponibilita and the price of electricity, have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for meetings in the election was an opportunity to think about such savings and on the ground, which takes power from nuclear energy.
Debate will be successful only when we examine all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French have set up their position on the objective facts and rational data.
So far, 7 billion human beings on the planet, But the demographic trends will odteďka doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, if we do not want a large proportion of the world's population of important part of life.
At the same time, face a shortage of fossil resources will be required in order to continue to produce electricity, and can not forget about the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the fight against climate change, which is something which at the moment are disappearing from the environmental debate.
Accident in Fukushima will have no effect on any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
But this is not the case with Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source of very capable of replacing them, or Switzerland, which sees fit to build only the last generation plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote the at least some of the countries are continuing with the determination of their projects.
The United States has decided to expand its fleet after Fukushima on one unit of the construction of a power plant suspended power plants three pleasantly Iceland after the accident.
If the German model based on renewable energy, sometimes presented as an example of the reality contradicts this.
The Berlin is seen rising electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas prices importovaném especially from Russia, the rapid rise in CO2 emissions caused by construction of power plants to natural gas, and coal.
Within a few months, all of these bad effects to be felt.
Case of Denmark deserves to look at him.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which accounts for 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of irregularities wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are increased by 65% and 50%, rather than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to our energy policy will pay for our neighbours more stable electricity bill by 40% higher than at the French households.
While in a globalized economy in energy costs are a key element of competitiveness and the guarantee of keeping the industry on the national territory, the French companies enjoy the benefits of nejlacinější electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would give rise to a strong increase in electricity prices, which would make iluzorními beautiful statement on the industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
Price that the vast majority of the French refuses to pay, as well as the are not against the energy, as polls show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy to stand up to the 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 related jobs.
Exportující industry for us is heavily on international markets, a large number of small and medium sized specialist businesses create jobs that can not be transferred abroad.
If France has decided to abandon the sacrifice would be quite a number of small and medium sized enterprises and came about 6 billion euros per year, that the country is for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
That ordered the owner of the plant, the nuclear reactor designed to operate 60 years, while it was planned decline of its producers?
In addressing the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic bullet for the production of energy source, and that there is no a deadly.
Development of facilities producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment, using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group Areva testifies to the complementarity of energy resources.
In the event of a nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.
In France we have a State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts rigorous and transparent monitoring of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new power plants in flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, they have the idea of security in the blood.
Met the nuclear industry three serious accidents in fifty years.
One remained in three pleasantly Iceland occurred in normal traffic conditions and without human victims, and the consequences for the environment.
In Chernobyl drama created the concept of the reactor and no human error.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters the unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lessons learned from this accident, just as it did in the two previous.
Fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities on nuclear safety, and designers is that type of reactor operators EPR is a concept of the capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all candidates who want to build a nuclear power plant, to see it, to stop its construction in the flamanville would be a great gift nabídnutým competitors of the Areva EDF and relaxation of the travel and companies the opportunity to seize the lead in the nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate energy to find the best solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let that emotion, dogmas and schemes have come to dominate the debate as key to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
It is a burden for the economy of immigration or chance?
In the area of immigration policy pursued for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - overloading the police, the courts and the administration subjected policy numbers make this policy to the status "of the country of human rights," which France boast.
Recently, it was the administrative harassment, whose object were foreign students, which has become the current when Interior Minister - see the newspaper Libération on 23 May - said that France "does not need foreign talent, zedníky and servírky."
But so far has been rarely rozebírána under úhlem economies.
It must be said that in this area are quite broad agreement between left and right.
On the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac gave his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million immigrant workers," and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990, said that France "can not take all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the level of generosity
In 2005, was the fear of invasion hord Polish plumbers on French territory obvious in on both the right and the left.
In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the level of generosity that uráčíme immigrants provide.
François Hollande in its programme is limited to banalities, when sales, a development that will solve our 'migration problem. "
This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem is perhaps in the elections, economically, but it is very expensive.
As economists that resemble Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published work syntetizujícím the latest knowledge about immigration - Exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 Str.: there is broad consensus among specialists migratory movements on the positive impact on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that immigrants are taking.
Reducing immigration is crippling and harmful to the employment growth.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace the French workers, especially those less qualified, and create downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants by much more than náhradníky for French workers by doing work in sectors with a lack of staff.
Few skilled immigrants in sectors that nepřitahují French workers, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough supply of jobs.
Positive impact on wages
As well as the surgeon will have difficulties with the work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesteziologů, this addition between French and migrants are that příchody immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni peri have calculated that growth of migratory movements by 1% will trigger a rise in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And at the same time, does not take into account the fact that the diversity of přinášená Immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth - a high proportion naturalizovaných immigrants between us, the Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, the paypal eBay immigrants and Yahoo are based.
Migrants are also net contributors to the social systems in European countries for an average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Organization work in Germany, for example, estimates that one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring for their whole life to public finances net contribution - revenue minus spending - with the explosive power of the euro.
Nicolas Sarkozy's desire to be at the start of his mandate for the missing percent growth "with vyceněnými teeth."
Said it intended to deter immigrants have just the opposite effect.
Europe - vynalezla democracy, there is a European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent on this should recall two thousand years ago in Athens, after all, despite the fact that it invented, experienced in the XX. century tragedy of World Wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also of Franco in Spain, salazara in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people might believe, that in order for a democracy to definitively were triumphs over their foes, will be enough to make a choice and implement it in the most direct way.
But is already knows from Napoleon, that it was about the ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, even if it is a sine qua non for Democracy, is not a sufficient and can become "an instrument of repression" as Republican philosopher once said Etienne vacherot.
No democracy requires much more: the public space, the spirit, the values, the separation of power and control enlightenment, education, social and economic solidarity, justice.
Europe's crisis, we are going through is a crisis of economic policy, but it is just so, and since the beginning of the crisis and democracy.
Acknowledging the mistakes of the Greek referendum of ano-ne will have double the value in this respect: the need for a return to political power, but also the worrying feeling his inability, nevhodnosti.
This ambivalence must be promýšlena, so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the line of the democratic struggle, přemístily today, and that many of the Republican fighters have already nestřílejí in the right direction.
Nothing we can win if we require a number of national referendums organised by according to need and in a disorderly way.
Blank exposed European absolutist monarchovi or leap with tied down into a void of the nationalist deep: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want it gilotiny, but a common, a fully fledged, peaceful and the steady performance of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
Are the crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, after all, and we did n't know where the STOP now - is because of the crisis in Europe.
This is, of course, the whole of Europe sklánějící before the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its failure and its lack of solidarity.
This is, of course, the whole of Europe, which is ponižována on the international stage.
Zneklidňujeme in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty and each of its nations with it.
As a matter of urgency democratic sovereignty must be returned to the management of the European project.
Europeans because only together will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of government markets and investment for the future.
East of the crisis will assume the decision at the European level, which can not be made without the full democratic legitimacy, otherwise we would be brought into the disaster.
Then, what we have long fought against the proposal of Socialists and Jacques Delors, all strongly today demanding the European economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and a passionate citizens as a whole, it would be new madness and a dead end.
We have to take on a new phase of the European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was essential to "Be Republicans."
Revolution in the interests could be enough to do so.
That lesson is to continue.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be able to carry out building Europe's more politically democratic, and the genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"bezkontaktní" čipové card is spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere will open on Tuesday in villepinte near Paris world veletrh čipových cards.
2011 should, according to the Cabinet eurosmart stop increasing the global sales of cards with mikroprocesorem - credit cards, phones SIM card - by 11% to more than 6 billion units.

Their contribution should still rise in 2012 - expected 580 million units - and to achieve approximately 10% of the total market in čipovými cards - 6,925 million cards.
After what has been a long time in the stream of the APEC countries, Europe takes the terrain in the bezkontaktním paying.
Around 26 million credit cards visa is already fitted with the functions and 75.000 payment terminals is accepted.
Beginnings in France are more modest: it has been a 400.000 bezkontaktních card VISA.
But the supermarket chains are working for two.
Carrefour so this year, 2.5 million bezkontaktních MasterCard cards pass.
To put a higher speed level of, we need to vybavovaly them from the teďka bank their customers.
"Two big French companies committed to distribute systematically his clients in the future bezdotykové bank cards," announces Mr nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test of mobilem
But this is only the first stage of the payment of the future: mobile phone.
Technology NFC - near field communication - necessary for the implementation of the transactions is today, with only a small number of machines.
"took the delay."
"But to their genuine expansion should take place within the next year."
"for 2012, we estimate the sale of 80 to 120 million units in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of the eurosmartu.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Bank Crédit Agricole yesterday announced the test carried out in the town of Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
Machines 170 pounds of approximately 200 clients and staff will be equipped with a pouzdrem povolujícím bezkontaktní payments.
Bank bpce has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that he is preparing to offer that permit its Customers pay the mobile phone bezdotykově.
Terrorist front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and sektou boko Haram.
A suspicion that there are volumes of al-Qaeda terrorist group establish a presence in the Islamic Maghreb - aqmi - and nigerskou sektou boko Haram confirm.
On Sunday, alžírského Deputy Secretary of State Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria "have certainty about it from now on."
"The way in which both organisations operate, and intelligence reports show that there are a lot of cooperation between them," explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has a similar analysis.
Investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010, could help shed light on a můstky.
Then, when they were kidnapped aqmi Members from one restaurant in Niamey, should be Antoine de léocour and Vincent delory killed the next day at the same time as some of their únosců during operation carried out by the Special French troops.
In the sutinách after a French and Nigerian Investigators need to identify a number of phones with chips of terrorists.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of the leading to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the station's interest to Radio France Internationale - RFI - particularly two figures: one leads to nigérijci explosions, which was at length in MAIDUGURI, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the cradle of boko Haram, and the second a person, which, it says, that is close to the aqmi and sektě.
"This is progress, but there is a need to wait for a more convincing evidence, before we talk about operational cooperation between the aqmi and boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"We have known for years that the sect from external financial and intellectual support and that is becoming increasingly more actively," mild by Nigeria's investigator Kunle amuwo.
In recent months, the "support" more and more obvious in the development and speeches boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which odteďka include human victims or are more explosive devices of the same way implementation, such as equipment used by the aqmi.
The international community led by Washington since then put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems, which resulted boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, long considered the Community for enlightened mystics little worthy of interest.
Rapid success
Sect boko Haram was established in the 2002 explosions in MAIDUGURI around mosques, schools and fundamentalists Mohammed yusufa. boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in language haoussa, approves the establishment of the Islamic emirátu in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region has such a combination of rapid success.
Sect politizuje and requires strict adherence to Islamic law šaria, whereas its supporters are starting the fight against the 'central government.
These people are focused first on churches, bars and offices.
In the 2009 supporters boko Haram become extremely active and znásobují their attacks against police stations.
The Government is still the same as usual.
Army obklíčí town and there are 800 dead.
Founder of sects Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
From that point on, the radikalizuje and leaving their whereabouts hidden in the north.
On Christmas Day 2010 will take in the city Jos assassination, in which 80 people taking into account, then another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is once again in the Abuja, where boko Haram attacked police headquarters in the prvém a suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN úřadovna first international targets.
A terrorist axis in Africa, that should lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, from all the security experts worry now.
Al-Qaeda now that establish a presence of the Islamic Maghreb obklíčila Mali and Iger and Somalis in the al-šabáb operate in Kenya, with boko Haram emerges as a new danger for the continent.
In Nigeria last week in an interview with the President goodluckem jonathanem Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of emergency, and is ready to "hand over all the information."
The world according to candidates for president
On issues relating to China, Iran or aid to Israel is Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing over in the simplification and neznalostech Association.
Can America weakened by the crisis to manage the world through simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates that voters would feel.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other halasná repeated statements and brief Guides Association on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often not slogans on China, Iran or help Israel coincide with each other.
Mitt Romney, is the best way to umisťující candidate in the race for the Republican nomination, "grand old party" to a Chinese before the World Trade Organization, and their accusations "because of their currency manipulation," which is a theme in America rozjitřené migration of parts of its industry in the direction of Asia.
Even worse if this must include the trade war on each other, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost zadrhl in the position that "uhlazuje emotions."
A tough but constructive dialogue with BEIJING - President Obama's current position.
But Huntsman, who is in the last places in the estimates, remains neposlouchatelný.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions do not succeed in stopping its nuclear program.
"If I was elected, uvězním Iran," said fanfarónsky.
"If elected, Obama again will have the Bomb."
Obama also promised to increase military aid to Israel, obviňujíc, that has failed in its obligations to the partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best umístivší candidate, shows the embarrassing ignorance association documents.
Recently called for a sharp position against Chinese military threat, because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capacity," Clearly illiterate - the fact that China's own nuclear weapons since 1964.
Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants a strikes against Iran, says that it is prepared to send American forces to Mexico to fight against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against a supposed terrorists whatever has been forbidden Obama in the 2009 is also recommended cainem, Perry and the other candidate Michele bachmannovou.
All are far from elsewhere, than it was in the 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan had an easy ideas and still won the Cold War.
That charge that Obama himself was amatér and add water to its wine in the fight against terrorism.
Highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, "boys" abrupt departure from Iraq, his excuses on Libya and that it only a weak
But the attack is not easy.
Population is President Obama's National Security Policy, which remove Ben Laden rather positive.
Since Iraq does not trust the military intervention, which lead to the quagmire.
Economically, and with argumentacemi, that there is a need to rebuild America in order to revive its leadership position, Obama is in a fairer place.
Nord Stream, a new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
Dálkový Nord Stream gas pipeline napojující directly to Russia and Eastern Europe, led by along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to start operating.
Must add gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, to properly celebrate this event.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, last Tuesday, new gas pipeline, which under the sea link directly to Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch colleague mark rutte turn their ovládacím together around ventilu regulating the entry of Russian gas to Western European networks.
This new pipeline will begin flowing additional cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe 27,5 billion every year the first potrubím on 1 224 km linking the St. Petersburg with the federal mecklembursko-pomořany countries.
Other pipelines, which needs to be completed at the end of the 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the amount of consumption, which is equivalent to the whole of the French.
And there is already a possibility to third pipeline gas pipeline on the same route.
Victory for Gazprom is timely completion of this huge construction in nature.
Against the highly protestovalo Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany without, in fact, that it would be conducted after the country a third State - Poland or Ukraine.
Together these two countries are somewhat to power: the opportunity to press Russia on threats that they will turn off access to Western European markets, it is becoming more difficult for them.
Most expressed it Warsaw, if not hesitate compared Nord Stream to the "new německo-sovětskému pact" with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in the 1939.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe through their support for the Russian project in it gained greater certainty of their purchases.
But it is at the cost of undermining Europe's energy, because the Project has created a schism between the Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia has barely five years ago to push through his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose deposits are coming to an end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, the new tepna, confirmed that connects us organically," Francois Fillon in the formal opening of the pipeline and demonstrated, at which point, the gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles leaders present in large numbers in the lubminu Gazprom gas přívodním place.
Construction of the pipeline is also an important technical offences.
Seamounts adoption of steel pipes is from equipped betonovým Veneer, in order to protect against the kotvami naval vessels.
Lies at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of the 200 metres.
In his building was needed to avoid minovým fields coming from the end of World War II.
"For the sake of security had to be almost 100 of them removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was important to also increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipeline is long metallic had associated as 242 eiffelovek that suspended for its entire length is nowhere nor the valves, maintenance.
One control plošina should be built in the vicinity of Sweden, but it rejected the project, although the Swedes were a little chtiví see the Russian civil society, how to permanently trapped on the coast.
"In the case of flaws halt to gas for less than 1 minute," clarifies the Jens Müller.
In the case of netěsnosti gas in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered a few likely empire-builders, after all, is svary was designed in such a way as to this one in 100 000 years.
Outside control of the pipeline carries out an robot, fueled by ships, while vnitřek pipeline is controlled by machine, which cirkuluje inside.
This equipment doutníkového shape on average 1 meter is introduced into vnitřku pipes and population has found itself pushed gas.
In goal during three days of travel at the speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information on the potential of deformacích metal parts.
Dálkový pipeline is designed to operate 50 years without it, in order to be any correction.
Circulation of the gas is simply to pressure.
Value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in goal.
Five companies to implement this project joined forces.
Leading position remains of Gazprom, which holds 51% share.
It joined a German company E.ON and BASF 15,5% each, as well as the French and Dutch society gasunie group GDF Suez - 9% each.
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream charge of construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
Business is located in the city of zoug in Switzerland, where it is extremely favourable taxation.
Gazprom, the company has leased out for five years, all of which can be obnovována, its capacity for the transport of gas.
"Gazprom will truly be a profit out of a total capacity, whether it is the amount of gas dopravovaného any," clarifies the Jens Müller.
Financing the construction of a gas pipeline has been secured from the 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
