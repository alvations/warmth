The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies need to combat electoral fraud.
Brennan Center but such fraud calls the myth that voter fraud in the U.S. is less frequent than the number of people who die by lightning.
Republican lawyers, moreover, for the last ten years, the only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the USA.
One thing is certain : this new provision will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine America's democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the U.S. federal organization responsible for the election of the States.
And in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult selection process, or register on the electoral list.
This phenomenon experienced a boom after the elections in November 2010, during which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.
Consequently, it was only in 2011 presented 180 proposals for laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to submit photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
These laws also limit the period for the elections in advance invalidate the right to enter the list of voters on election day and take away the right to vote to people with a criminal record.
Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to submit photo identification půkazu any U.S. state.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
Upheld the constitutionality of the Indian Act in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this procedure to other states.
Over the last two years to support proposals such laws in 34 states to force voters to present photo identification.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec U.S. citizens have universal identity, such as health insurance card.
In fact, owned 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people aged be chosen, no identity card with photograph issued by their state government.
Furthermore, no such identity card about five million new voters in 2012.
Acquisition of the required proof of identity in addition they are often more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes below$ 35,000, 18% of those aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years are therefore not required photo identification.
And that's not all.
Students who are as famous for their voters shift to democratic candidates in several states are authorized to use your photo ID issued by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting and fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates, cards issued by these clubs to use during elections.
Until 2004, did not require any state in the election proof of citizenship.
The first such requirement introduced Arizona.
Since 2011, a dozen states adopted laws that require voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly aimed at reducing the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted is that two of the three Hispanics prefer Democratic party.
Republican legislators in 2011 supported in eight states laws that cancel registration of voters on election day.
In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.
These limitations have consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register about 10 million inhabitants.
Measures taken after 2009 but caused a decline in the writing of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then in five other states have enacted laws aimed at shortening the time period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in this state was only 13%.
For Hispanics was the same.
They were a mere 11% of all voters, but 24% of people voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who constituted 76% of all voters accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Against the pass laws which restrict voter registration, of course, very strongly opposed Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.
Democratic governors blocked the veto several bills.
In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.
Damages they managed to partially limit.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph taken just 16 of the 34 states.
Newly established rules, however, quite undeniably more difficult in 2012, the exercise of voting rights.
Democratic critics talking mainly about bias laws passed and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the election results in 2012 in key states.
Report Brennan Centre from 2011 shows that states where these laws were approved, representing 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is already certain : this new provision will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine America's democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer : complete examination or not?
Test PSA brought sometimes erroneous results that were false negative or even false positives, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this has increased the reluctance of men who are already reluctant to investigate all go.
To be examined or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the U.S. showed high levels of contamination between the different groups tested, it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, noted differences in mortality between patients who underwent examination, and those who did not go to them.
This study also demonstrated after 12 years apart, that those who do not go to investigate, they have a 30-40% higher risk of metastasis.
I therefore recommend that examination from age 50 or 40 years, if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Vulnerable groups are also men of African origin.
The key is to make the right decision when the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive cancers and those species that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain the patient's level of dangerousness of the type of cancer, offer him alternatives, necessarily not treat prostate cancer that has no long-term impact on the lives and focus in these cases rather active disease surveillance.
Today, a number of men whose cancer was diagnosed, treated, because of their type of cancer is aggressive and is not hazardous to life.
We design them rather implementation of active surveillance in case of disease progression will offer them treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater accuracy establishes criteria to help you decide which type of treat and which not.
Nevertheless therefore recommend testing completed.
It is important however to complete a medical interview and determine whether it is appropriate to take the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology Movember movement created a tool that lets you evaluate the pros and cons of PSA examination.

prevention of disease
Unfortunately there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce disease risk acceptance principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and sufficiently moved, you could prevent up to 30% of cancer cases.
"If everyone quit smoking, this figure rose by at least 50%," emphasizes André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers causes inheritance.
Any percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The Canadian Society for Research on Cancer remains a priority the fight against smoking, although the number of smokers is decreasing.
Cigarettes worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several other.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"Even today in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," shaking his head spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data : 10 years after a smoker stops smoking decreases the risk of cancer death by half.
weight
Obesity and obesity are under SCC another risk factor for disease incidence.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report added.
nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
When excessive consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid cold meats, for which the same applies.
Preserving of meat smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer development," the report added.
vitamins
Recently, various researchers focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, studies have not yielded conclusive.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory by SCC.
Although one of them will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies prove rather increase it.
Neither the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu also stresses how important it is to talk about their fears and precedents of families with their doctor.
"Submit to the examination does not mean that you have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
Announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson sparked last summer authorized stir.
There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
A further is the last particle, whose existence is predicted standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physics but still there is little hundred percent sure that this is the Higgs boson.
No doubt about it, we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
New data released this week during the great physical Congress in Kyoto, it rather confirms, however, still lacking any data that we can be absolutely sure.
Suppose, however, that it is the Higgs boson, since the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see, what is going on.
In this world it is beyond question the law, according to which two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can not be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you hurt yourself.
Although particle physics very strange world, it turns out that it applies even similar laws : the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
In addition, particle physicists are divided into two categories.
On one side we find the good citizens, or fermions, which obediently comply with the Pauli principle.
And at the other end of the range bosons, depending anarchists who respect nothing at all - certainly did not this principle, which means that they can still be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (absolutely amazing by the way), which is The Particle Adventure, laboratories Berkeley : mesons, which are let go unnoticed, "force particles", which spreads a great natural forces with which the Higgs boson probably somehow related.
Must say, however, that these bosons are not so exotic animals, as one might think.
If you read this article, this is due to an unusual banality boson : the photon, or "particle of light", which is "awarded" the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when electrically charged particles accelerate or change direction, ' cancel ' the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "distraction" created an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "holders of power."
stable field
Also, it is the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that "disturb" should be another field, Higgs field to the boson discovered.
The Higgs field is much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field, for its excitation is necessary to achieve very high energy values , like the frozen pond, already zčeří a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part of the accelerator as an accelerator in CERN - Large hadron collider the colliding beam is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - In order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field, we again fit to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
The electromagnetic field does not respond or all particles or all materials.
Some, such as magnets do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, never by itself stick on the fridge.
And the same applies to the Higgs field particles do not respond to all : those who do, have a certain mass, while others (such as the photon, let's look at it) do not.
A Mrs. Doe asks what all these studies are that "bring us?"
From the point of view of science as a confirmation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to undergo examination of any discrepancy between observation and predictions of SM.
In addition, quite a few physicists literally wishes, in order to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and to close some of the gaps in the model.
It is necessary to state that the model still has huge gaps, does not shed any light gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of matter in the universe (again, whoa).
CERN facility but until now such discrepancies appeared.
Responses
Responses of research in everyday life of Mr. and Mrs. Novak is very difficult to predict, it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.
Search for: at the very beginning of the 60th flight pioneers did not have laser at Bell Labs no idea of revolution, which causes their work.
Anticipated scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (last rays of the pulse) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially considered a "toy in the lab".
Just imagine...
And moreover, it may result from the use of any tools, which surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle made a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on the optics.
This sensor, though not as Boyle initially planned, now serves as the "eye" of digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course this does not mean that the activities around the LHC will necessarily change your life, but it means that one never really knows...
Palliative Care - The best way to leave the life of... | Le Devoir
Through its Commission for dignified dying Quebec recently joined the delicate questions concerning the end of life.
The debate should continue soon and at the same time preparing the bill.
In this crucial area remains to be done a lot of work.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer that consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's seven," he said without emotion on his bed at home for palliative care Victor - Gadbois in Beloeil, where they arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock to this you can not prepare," he adds.
The disease has done its work: the enormous weakness prevents him take himself to the toilet or just to feed himself.
Resigned looking at delicious -looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles and speaks with the unknown, who is at his stop, he brings drugs offer bath.
Courage to an ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, he humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later he found a team of doctors to cure his problem.
"Throughout life, one learns that the guys standing urine," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor - Gadbois.
Return to this stage the child is unacceptable for some people to humiliation.
"It depends on the capabilities of a particular person," whether he shall return, says psychologist.
According to the number of persons engaged in palliative care are crucial moments take place in the core of such a return.
Patients who enter into a home with palliative care Victor - Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
The prognosis is more than three months of life.
At this stage, their team of doctors and nurses who care for them, does the so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die "to suffocation while conscious."
Disease but allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"In life we have no desire," he says, and then consents to put her breathing apparatus.
Yet still enjoying in the coming days on the last visit of the son of Italy.
The home of Victor - Gadbois in collaboration with a group of volunteers providing care for the body with nutrition.
So it looks palliative care, which started when no longer do anything else.
That death was convenient.
In Quebec, the case of one bed palliative care to 11,700 people.
This is very little, if we realize that everyone dies.
Here life goes on in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can provide such a sip of brandy or pepsi to taste.
Diabetics do not have to watch your blood sugar.
A death is a part of everyday life.
Last night, carrying beer to Mr. X, who later died in the night.
This morning, finish your beer in honor of his son deceased father.
"Helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardová, director of nursing services.
The home of Victor - Gadbois go one day at a time, but do not resemble each other.
Besides třiadevadesátiletého man who rejoices in the last meeting with his family to thoroughly padded cushions while his toast in his honor, died tragically thirty-six man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after having tried all possibilities to survive.
"For half a year, there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer within 45 years," he says with concern, Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients in the home Victor - Gadbois come, come here from their homes, 47% of hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, ie care that is intended to alleviate the suffering, sick soon reach the final phase of his life, be it at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
A few organizations, such as the home of Victor - Gadbois and Society for the palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively to the care provided to cancer patients.
It is this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that the number of physicians specializing in palliative care is concerned the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatments such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec health care system is not powerful enough to ensure access of all people to quality palliative care before it can agree to carry out euthanasia.
As he said recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain, without anyone done the necessary steps to be relieved.
He fears that patients did not ask for death because they lack the appropriate care.
At the same time, the number of oncologists caring for their patients until the last moments notwithstanding the unfavorable prognosis.
The chances of survival Hélène Richard have been minimal, if left intensive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce that I quit treatment, said he regrets that stop fighting, tells us.
And they told me that it's over!
There is omnipotent care
Dr. Martel is estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to their physicians for their desire not completed when their team palliative pussy alleviate pain.
But I must say that palliative care is definitely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care at the Society for palliative care in Grand Montréal, patients prevents pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life often doctors use palliative sedation that the patient sleeps until death, either abruptly or whether he sedatives administered continuously.
I can not pretend that this part of the suffering perceive.
Patients who get rid of pain, will still have more access to palliative sedative.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die."
That does not necessarily mean "I want you gave me Euthanasia" means rather "I want to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this grant enabled the coverage for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials path management business in construction and public works, political parties, lobbyists, and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which the mixed construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
This "study" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system crumbled by the time we take serious measures," says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to him erupted in 2011 scandal to the diligent investigation into embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts to build roads in Quebec, which then Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest approved after long delays.
"Duchesneauova report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "saved only to the Department of Transportation Procurement billion dollars," although some people keep in check his instincts to get them to share!
Charbonneau commission "has already led to the resignation of two mayors," adds the hope that she could "uncover some cunning people."
Permanent unit to fight corruption started in 2011
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption founded in 2011, also engaged in the fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
This even policemen "Marteauovy party", who since 2009 have ensured that Montreal "cartel moneytubing" significantly eased inflation orders...
In recent weeks a number of inspections carried out and accuse him of fraud and corruption, a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a municipality in the suburbs.
The next on the list to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from the mayor of Laval, Quebec 's third largest city.
It is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for contracts.
Formal charges have already received a traffic engineer from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by the Commission explained the mechanism as a "system" for public sector contracts.
He spent during these years, 3% of the value of contracts won in Montreal, agents associated with the Mafia, which then transferred the money of the Union Montréal, which ran for mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was in the 2000s generous to all parties and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) provincial parties, particularly the Liberals, who were then in power.
He admitted also that organized the illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeauovou.
Contracts with moneytubing whose exaggerated prices
In Montreal work "system" of corruption very briskly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer it before the commission described in detail : in the ten years from construction companies received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, the restaurants, hockey and spending money worth a total of$ 736,000 in exchange for a contract with moneytubing, where exaggerated price.
Other officials from the transport sector confessed that she made to pay compensation for that 30% to 40% overestimated the false invoices through extra work.
Organizer mayor by Martin Dumont then Tremblaye accused of being at ease turning a blind eye to the concurrent budget, which led to his coffers dirty money.
Based on these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged into a major crisis Montréal.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first members of Montreal, who issued a warning.
As mayor circuit Rivière - des - Prairies to the east of the island since 2010, committed to the sale of municipal land purchased for$ 5,000,000 and sold for... 1600000 promoters in the midst of a flourishing real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation will finally begin, says that "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrene and caught the culprits."
The process according to the "painful but positive."
We are at the stage of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to establish in Montréal own investigative unit and provide oversight to these dubious practices could not be undone.
Like when cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau says that "public officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned in particular the role of "members informed about the deceit" if these gimmick to get wet!
It is estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Quebec comes from money laundering, as irony, he adds: "I've heard that it's just nothing special really."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties$ 100, but it does not resolve the situation, according to him, "As long as they strictly limit election spending dirty money out of politics disappears."
It proposes a comprehensive monitoring system of public procurement and financing of parties, "which you can not drop, if the focus is boldly to the essence of things, we can build again on more solid foundations and with more control and compliance with laws."
If this story defamed the image of Quebec in Montreal and abroad, Duchesneau recommended to all those who deride him to look at your own backyard...
"PSG is FC Barcelona!"
In this season you with PSG put a whole new tempo.
How do you explain this trend?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone to yourself or a totally new dimension PSG.
They came to us big boys.
Every day, in addition to getting them on.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to increase the level of play.
And when it's easier matches.
In football everything goes really fast.
But do not lose your head.
Ever since my beginnings in the mailroom at INF Clairefontaine to move to Saint - Etienne, I have always pushed the level of the individual.
So you use the competitive environment, which introduced Carlo Ancelotti...
Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every workout is essential.
And that means that a player like me it has more flavor to the game and wants to give maximum performance.
And I Carlo Ancelotti much giving in the context of my position.
The hands have assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
A Ancelotti has the last word at the right moment?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today has the first League peer and one of the best European coaches.
He has vast experience with top teams and won a lot of titles.
He also worked with great players.
For me to win more titles in Paris.
In January I attended with him comforting conversation.
It had been a series of injuries.
Trust, which provides me with is another reason for my performance.
As you look at the first part of the season PSG?
In the first We Lyon took the league lead.
But remain in suspension.
One of our main goals is to Champions League: We very easily advanced to the final.
What is your club in this competition target?
We try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we definitely want to be a good European teams tough opponent.
We want to first win their qualifying group ahead of Porto in order to play in the replay osmifinále home.
PSG may happen in the short term major European club?
The budget has to be...
Paris to become a major European club to win titles and make history.
Today it is not already.
On the financial side PSG has the means to carry out this plan succeeded.
And it would be a big failure in the first nezvítězit league as last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year really want to win the league title.
Last season we still lacked enough.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to, to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points are clear champion...
Yet another club, Montpellier, had season even more amazing.
I think this year it will.
Although the title of endeavor and big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think that we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media from PSG expecting too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us due to what was invested and what our players.
It totally accept.
It is a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and he's still find something to accuse us in the newspaper, so it's not exactly pleasant.
One wonders what the people you still might want more.
It is not, of course, winning 4-0 every weekend.
We are FC Barcelona!
We strive to set the style of play.
To build a team you need time.
In the Champions League we have proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who have already qualified for the second season round, while also invested a large amount!
Given the sums invested, one would expect that you will have over the other 15 points ahead!
This insult other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which last season was not very successful, with the new PSG moved to the next stage.
This shows how the first League amazing.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems as though PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is well, it is said that there is "dependence on Zlatan."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it gives a lot of goals.
Because he came here and shows that the star of the first League.
Wherever passed, proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team we respect the person and player.
He respects people around me that has.
What they have achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to the fact that increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows other parallel growth.
How did you live Euro 2012 with the French representation?
As disappointing.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately due to injury, I could not play the way I imagined.
But I experienced it and I came out of it stronger.
Today I managed to play in the representation of good matches.
And I was hoping since joining the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe to ourselves, to our exemplary behavior.
As you look at the first month of Didier Deschamps led the national team?
Results speak for him.
In qualifying for the World Cup we are in a good place.
Coach selects the top, players are nearby and able to inspire victory.
Such was the Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to compare.
Blanc has achieved its goals because we have qualified for Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the team to Brazil.
Is a draw (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid starting the game?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for a team.
Before this shock in Spain I during his career never seen such a match.
With Bitcoin, you can sell without paying a bank
All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs for the recipient.
As in these technologies often true, there is a feeling overt political outlook: The belief that the current financial system is built on banking monopoly leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), as a virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euros...) and secure transfer protocol like BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between pairs of partners.
With 15,000 computers in the network have been registered about 200,000 transactions.
About a thousand websites already accepts Bitcoin as gifts or as payment.
Bitcoin exchange rate peaked first$ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to$ 2, today borders on about ten dollars (list of courses is listed on the bitcoincharts.com).
Compared with the world in exchange for real money or financial product that is nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) interest on this fact in his report on the virtual finances, which was released in October.
Bitcoin described as "the most successful virtual money", "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "period of normal cash."
Bitcoin from other types of virtual money differs in that it is a "credit" for the procedure used in the video game, which one gets to play or you can buy (and sometimes even replace the back).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, but the central authority controls and processes each communication.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes Book Depository current accounts, auditors, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this system work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses via e - mail.
The user may select a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
File information related to this transaction is electronically signed an encryption system with double key.
The network can verify the transaction.
Due to the content of the file is also possible to ensure that replacement Bitcoin existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
Key stage consists of writing this new transaction in this book.
Performed by solving mathematical tasks assigned by computers whose leader, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is the stage cut file, ie the transformation of a huge file to a shorter unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add to the number, then the whole "hack".
The aim is to find a number that provides specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then displayed indelibly linked to a string of other transactions; any modification altering the image.
If the user wanted for fraud, to pay the same money twice quickly in succession (within ten minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.
A computer that will solve the challenge, winning 50 Bitcoin.
To avoid inflation, share the reward periodically of two, probably by the end of 2012.
Number of Bitcoin in circulation is so limited number 21000000, but you can divide up the stomilióntinu, making room for margin here is...
Difficulty of the task at hand is also increased with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and were stored Bitcoin theft.
"Exploit a loophole is not the protocol itself," she says Pierre Noize, who founded Paymium, the company for the payment of real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
ECB also checks, money laundering due to the anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse gifts that nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform is adopted.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book and current accounts showed that almost 80% of Bitcoin does not circulate.
In November launched a "huge discounts".
"It was replaced thirty thousand U.S. dollars," says a delighted Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaged in converting Bitcoin to Gold.
Pierre Noize, who is also the author of books on the teaching of the money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
The system Paytunia is equivalent to a credit card (real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system for verification of transactions, which are thus cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily adjusted at merchants where it is not necessary to install the new terminals or the like.
Just tell the address that the phone can be "photocopied and recognize," explains Pierre Noize, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin promote, not just yet, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
ECB in its report foresees a reassessment of various risks, which are today considered to be increased if this kind of money to be successful.
We left Afghanistan.
The Dál with?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army took control over its territory and that the Afghans choose their own future and wait for all of us.
The biggest injury suffered people in rural Afghanistan, which are punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, for we have lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all the injuries and mutilations.
Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often the villagers who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they added jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Now experiencing tolerance and often help local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support drops.
The departure of French troops from bases Nijrab, which I watched from the mountain tops jeweled almond thanks to French loans, took place peacefully.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without air escort for assault helicopters.
Since the end of 2014 already in Kabul, the Taliban are not so active.
From the unstoppable progress in the years 1994-1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time and the country was in blood and fire in the fighting between the various resistance groups.
They take control of the country was then regarded as a kind of liberation, return to security.
Afghans paid the price for obscurantism of these villagers, who completely dominated the Al - Ká'ida, their situation has not improved in our time.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban current coincide in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against the Soviet troops have returned to power in 2001.
They became profiteers prevailed government land sold as building plots refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and to use the huge U.S. orders to subcontractors.

From what I heard in campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will form the thieves.
Many young people want to leave as they leave those who were able to take advantage of American generosity : capital flight is considerable.
Young already tired of war and the associated ideology.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan recognized the modern world and its advantages is interesting.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years living in Kabul currently 5,000,000 inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, they go there girls and boys.
These young people will be provided to the work they already do not want to go back to previous pages obscurantism or corruption of some officials.

Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should be to enjoy a certain degree of decentralization modeled after Western States, but the U.S. had wanted to transform the centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so that was abolished post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in in 1964.
President Karzai wants foreign control, especially when elections are scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, is from the 50th and earlier years is heavily dependent on foreign aid.

Everything is imported, nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war would be necessary government control infrastructure.
Spread rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that's feeding the feeling that Western states were there just to be seized.
Without energy, the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot and without means of transportation of raw materials through the mountains but no mineral extraction can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned copper mine Mes Aynak and let the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore a large Buddhist complex to retain the most important role of employers in the province.
One day you will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on large part of imports and exports resumed normal relations.

To these farmers freed from rebellion led by foreign groups, wish to achieve in his own words slight Civil help in their favor, which would be properly controlled and touching them directly.
Difficult to work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi tackled another poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided over the imposition of the Constitution, which grants him unlimited powers temporarily, decided to play a gamble.
Announced Wednesday regardless of the opinions of others, the Constituent Assembly approved the final version the next day.
Less than a week ago gave the head of state to the Assembly next two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years Egypt uses temporary text that has been updated many times, eroding the constitutional stability of the country and led to legal guesswork.
This new initiative will only strengthen ambivalence country.
From the perspective of opposition to the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continue "breaking his word" and "tramples on the right."
His followers, however, assure that it is a means to turn as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
For two weeks should hold a referendum.
It is a very short period of time, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the plan text Egyptians clarify the article after article.
For the president it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the country convulsed protests.
As confirmed in an interview with Time magazine, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people against the ultimatum : "Either approve my text, or have unlimited powers" that would otherwise have the approval of the new constitution to end.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members mentioned the Constituent Assembly with the great majority of Islamists text approved.
Most Liberals vote missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, he slammed the door with it, they are not able to enforce their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or religious minorities emulate their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, were yesterday morning hastily completed 11 persons from among the substitutes.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators also commented on the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some committee members argued that the clock in the meeting room are not properly adjusted.
The text voted on yet last night, consists of 234 articles.
Subject to general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately identical with the version of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist party for which the introduction of Islamic law, one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term "principles" by "rules" which would allow stricter enforcement.
For Islamists again that this article has not been corrected, a sign of their good will and respect to the other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", argue liberals, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
According to it, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
They focus in particular Article 220, which confers the University of al - Azhar advisory role, especially for issues of control of conformity of laws with sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it's upsetting because " persons called for expression are selected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen as a theocracy beginnings. "
Worries Liberals even more fans the fact that the next chancellor of the University should be less conservative than the existing one.
" So far, showed no particular religious consequence.
With this constitution remains Egypt generally civil state.
Most lawyers who worked on this text, not chip away, but academics, many of them studied in French schools, " moderate concern Alexis Blouet, which prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.
But agree that " there may be discrepancies regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because there are terms used in religious terminology.
There is particular reference to the "fiqh" [ Islamic jurisprudence, ed. ed. ].
And in the future may appear question, to what extent are civil judges competent to be able to express. "
Yesterday approved text, in addition to religious sites highly criticized because of enhanced powers granted to the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction compared to the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers entrusted to the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military will be verifying the defense budget to carry out Parliament, but the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, not in military courts prohibited the management of civilians, as demanded by the association for the protection of human rights.
This association is discussed in relation to the text which they say is aimed against freedom of its concerns.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and continues to insult the disabled, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
No article does not deal with the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point of the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36
This word was mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had last night stand out in a televised speech, this afternoon are scheduled rallies.
Supporters of the head of state will be manifest on Saturday.

"Great and Mighty" to notify to Moscow : emigrants to save money on language
While parliamentarians and human rights defenders still debating the law on compulsory language tests in the country have already discovered scammers who are selling "fake" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities arrives annually 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the Act, which stipulates that anyone migrant workers must pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.
Yet this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail.
FMS also promises that by the time the tests are mandatory for all visitors.
The tests, however, will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Knowledge of the language will also be confirming to the acquisition and renewal of work permits.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The Act was not subject to the people who have successfully achieved certification and obtain an academic degree in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit and protection of the rights condemnation
Network test sites will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, University friendship between nations, Moscow State University, State University of ST. St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all the cities, it is already in Russia opened more than 160 such centers.
Initiatives to support the implementation of testing supported by deputies of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask many times in the press question and what it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the actual visitors?
First of all - meet representatives of the migration service - allows to reduce the number of people who suffer from "slave labor."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Chairman FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
Protecting their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment to 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for immigrants without occupation, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowing the language - he says with conviction Sebelev - the future migrant sentenced to clashes with rogue people who help him on the pretext of ensuring "voucher" in terrible, tight hostels, in which he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents and toil for 12-14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receive many complaints.
"In their homeland they promise one, but after the arrival deceive, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages," says Chief of Tajik labor migration management MS Tolib Sharipov.
Complain!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to get, but do not experience even with the job.
Of course it is not so much their fault as much as the disaster : very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, put on a recall to school.
As children grow into productive age must be the first opportunity to go to work.
Without knowledge of the language is difficult - admit.
"You feel humiliated and miserable."
It is true that with regard to the law on language tests highlight human rights defenders on one important thing.
Testing will be performed only for those migrants who have legal status.
If you do not have it, so there will be no exams or receive any official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers live as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No entry for unauthorized"
Many of the immigrant workers argue that to gain official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all these language problems.
Legalization addition, costs money : 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we are basically false documents without registration, and the resulting extortion.
"They need a hundred to two cigarettes, tea," - shared with reporters about their experiences citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, do not be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the law on language found that are not only false papers for registration of migrants.
Employees FMS already seized several fake certificates of completion of exams.
Counterfeit documents are printed on plain color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get for free: each of migrants in the hope that it will facilitate problem with passing tests paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
It is two and a half times higher amount than the official completion of the test: it will become migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is so secure your system against corruption, the workers could not simply buy papers, of which coincide with government officials and human rights defenders.
Government authorities can not promise foreign workers, who have not mastered the test the first time, it takes time for it to undergo a basic course in Russian language.
For visitors who can not Russian, is expected to work in areas which do not require active dealing with people.
MVD (Interior Ministry) does not take into circulation of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia is proposing a tightening of the law in relation to civilian firearms owners.
It is the response of government authorities at recent events : stimulus cases were shooting at weddings, which went without victims, and ready to massacre Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, the result of which killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raising the age from which to obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption Jarovaja Irina, who promised to change the law on firearms will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem through "tightening the screws".
In the network appeared an open letter, the authors - representatives of various social organizations of shooting - require rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
Percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, in an interview with the BBC Russian.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Interior was for six months in 2012 committed 142 crimes using firearms registered authorities of the Ministry of Interior, while for the same period a total of 1,168 were committed thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced tightening legislation on civilian weapons do not cause the offender to join the "black" market.
In their words can currently be found in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
Currently, the Interior Ministry said the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers : from racing after officers
"Black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channel is five, says retired Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years in the offices of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot sites that accept orders weapons
The first - "Army or the military way", that is a gun that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Guns stolen and Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," says Baranec.
Another type of "black guns" weapons are stolen by criminals representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes stealing from police stores and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement.
Illegal "mainly" to get into the sale of military depots.
In many military warehouses often leads to outbursts.
"There is evidence that some fires were started deliberately - in order to conceal shortages," says a former soldier.
His contribution brings the words of Barance and arms manufacturers.
"Currently arise private armament firms that are not competitive on the international market, and decommission weapons that give the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of "black" market smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is the manufacture, sometimes there weapons produced in small-scale production, and was the Mafia, who organized their continuous production," says a former soldier.
Where 's the gun?
The experts added up, what is the approximate proportion of individual sources of illegal weapons in the "black" market.
Report on this issue prepared in 2011 Centrum problem analysis and design of public administration.
Specialists dismantled statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminological literature data and public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, comes from the military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons ended up on the black market "due to officers whose work involves weapons," says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts in 14% of cases of stolen weapons in their production, 5% is "black archeology".
Vendor- consultant of one of the arms trade, which asked us to mention his name, he is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations black "archeologists" a long time ago nobody buys - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, the seller goes for new shipments directly to military depots.
Despite Ensign a candidate buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
In order him a gun and he'll sell it over the fence.
"That drive it into the city, and you sell it for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," she says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, so whenever they start burning plan in crime detection, implement control purchases at merchants with illegal weapons," said consultant.
"As in the luxury business"
The seller with the buyer most often found each other through their friends.
I visited websites and blogs, did not appear until the guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the platform "test", where the man who led me to the "corner" where we act together.
The price mainly I learned there to
Military correspondent Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, telling the salesman - Consultant. - One I have known, but fully trust him.
Vendors at the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "by Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that her daughter lost a tooth."
And now, get there through a man whom I am sure.
He also gives me only because he knows that I do Neudau.
Elementary seeking weapon in various ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid- 90th years, when processed essay for publication on this topic.
Wiring according to his words changed.
They gave him an album with photos where the "everything what you'd think."
"I felt like in a luxury shop," recalls a soldier.
Buyer, in the words Baranec not offer testing - all you can try.
I, the potential client, just do not buy - let the seller to the forest and how to build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we are looking for," describes how an expert.

According to the official statistical office declined compared with the period January-October 2011 the number of crimes in Russia total about 7% and amounted to 22,900 cases, and the number of solved cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the U.S. striking workers supermarkets and fast-food
Work at the cash register of establishments "McDonald" goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages of Walmart supermarkets and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave transforms into the ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
All the support departments that share a number of leftist social organizations.
In addition to a modest increase in salaries they receive ordinary workers at Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of the organizers of the protests achieve them create their unions.
Currently, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when America struck orgy cheap sale, gripped millions of citizens and, in some cases accompanied by a brawl.
On this day, some workers by Walmart, in which the world operates on the 2.2 million people left their work and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals retail chains, which are intended for people from the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells worldwide everything from diapers through hunting rifles and automotive batteries to the cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in the stores are an average of 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage workers in Walmart stores purchases only in my work.
Availability of a range of products made from chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply partly because few pay their employees.
They also complain about the bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic or manual wheelchairs scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded salary increase and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by increased sharply from 30 to 100 U.S. dollars a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets$ 9.5 per hour, it does not correspond to a height of expenditure, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase the average wage to$ 12 an hour, it will cost the company$ 3.2 billion annually.
It is on average 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If the company moves Walmart wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store cost only about 46 cents more.
For the year as customers spend about$ 12.39 more than today.
Advocates of Walmart pointed out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" in stores company lasted from 8 pm Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this period, Walmart sold around 5,000 product items per second.
Overall, the Treasury implemented the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
A company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that jobs have left the whole "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all in all "other media sensation", organized by the trade unions.
"Unattended cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was not Walmart stores (those in the progressive city that are not too fond of, and therefore there is almost none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says that sells billions of servings, and then you either paid sick leave and do not pay you well for your hard work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations in the State of New York$ 7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurant that wages gradually increase, but only slightly, and on average receive their rank and file workers in New York$ 8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city nobody has a lower wage.
Well enough to understand how you can be in New York for that kind of money.
Employing the "McDonald" is going through nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and living with their parents.
Few people sees this as their main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for long.
Currently constantly encounter in an interview with the staff of "McDonald's", who complain that they have to live off the money and some of them even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum hangs comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you feed.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 am Thursday at the "McDonald's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cook at a fast food enterprises began to receive at least$ 15 per hour, which is more than double the current minimum wages.
It also demanded that in the realm of fast food were based trade organization.
U.S. law prohibits the administration hinder the creation of trade unions and trade union activists to punish harassment and dismissals.
On the other hand their management rarely makes life easier.
Establish fast food companies trade unions is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is extremely high staff turnover.
disagreement
In this day held noisy protests in a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The climax of the event was noon rally at the "McDonald's" near Times Square, where he performed several local Democratic politicians, particularly members of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said : "McDonald" says sells billions of servings, and then you either paid sick leave and not you properly for your hard work! "
Demonstrators will finally support as well as other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to speak in support of fast-food workers so as to achieve a fair remuneration for their work and the economic prosperity it deserves every New Yorker!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food sector.
But it was attended by a few hundred people, although not all of them were employees of fast food in New York to employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear.
"We are doing brain deceive average"
Among fans of modern technologies of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality, in recent years it means to perceive the world through the prism particularly special glasses.
At the beginning of summer at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a working model of the news and in November it was announced that the relevant patent application filed by Microsoft as well.
In an interview with the head of a group of interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft's Cambridge lab Sarama Izadim that the scientists of this company are glasses of the past.
Attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us generally what does your research group?
- We are human interaction with machines, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity still stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touching the screen with your finger.
We look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensor - it is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without the Kinect sensor, because for all the very interesting possibility to control with gestures.
- What else does the future hold?
- Despite the fact that the system Kinect transferred to the physical level of interaction, a lot of interaction still takes place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Input information flow is improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the outlet flow is still not particularly.
We're trying to change, we work to truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies including projective.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more realistic.
For this purpose it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can add to the real world of virtual objects in much better form.
And in the first place - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is a popular thing, but not revaluated with?
- Surely it can not be considered a panacea - the question of privacy, they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood about their actions and intentions.
In fact, any type of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gesture, but not the sweeping, only those skoupých, short.
Gesta Yet it would not pick up a camera device, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
There is a large, but theoretically it can reduce the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as voice + gesture.
- How so?
- How to ask me for example, I give you this can of soda?
You say it and at the same time show.
- I usually just simply talking.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.
- So you want to force the user to adapt to what at any given moment may or may not machine?
- That's not necessary, but it is mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can accurately detect human reaction.
It can be as laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for a modern camera?
There is now sufficient resolution, depth, or something else?
- In fact, the current generation - that is, from what may be reflected in our work on three-dimensional pattern recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s
But it's not just about megapixels alone, but as nuts and depth.
At the current point of view, all the current technology that we lack - that more work designers algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in X and Y, but also Z.
So very important is the speed, number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and simultaneous data streams 30 frames per second, frankly, are a little low, especially for the gesture.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing in length from 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands what extent it affects the human-machine interaction.
For me it would be very useful work equivalent to such a device, just do not need as much contact, but need some extra frames per second.
- A increasing number of cameras is not necessary?
- On Kinect are now used three "camera", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second - the reflected signal receiver.
A third camera - it is actually a common sensor visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
The larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or it worse, because it would increase the required volume of the calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play the curvature of the placement of the cameras and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) presented himself publicly their glasses.
Do not you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course a walk while constantly keeping smatphone in upraised hand is not very comfortable, but I think : the most powerful variant would be "portable" form of augmented reality, which could be based on platforms clouds switch from glasses ever smartphone, projection screen and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (private stuff yourself only), and at the same weakness - Augmented Reality based glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available only Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point : there is no touch response!
Hands do not feel anything!
What answers your group prepares for the challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the addition of tactile sensations could well happen eighth breakthrough.
Meanwhile, use one of the interesting tricks - use second-hand as a kind of substrate for imaging.
An excellent way compression records!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibility these "images in the air" - such as interference few directional ultrasound beam at a defined point where the finger, raised tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on his wrist that affects the nerve endings in your fingers - a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think, to feel what it seems, that he should feel at the moment when they see something?
- It is a good idea, we never tried.
Here, there's yet another challenge that will fight long - how to get a man who is physically located in a very confined space, to believe that he was walking in an open, practically infinite space - are also working on the concept of trails (no not those a club), moving platforms, and huge balls.
If deception brain becomes a target, so it works even for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality and attractive for researchers - many things are in a sheer beginning.
Vkusovština instead Culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "St. Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated citizens who are at the forefront, the vanguard of culture and art.
At the top of the list has been an important figure in St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often found recognition in Europe without reaching the All-Russian fame.
New hero "Rosbaltu" is a stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum in the summer garden, in the trendy pubs and openings.
Paintings Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the crowds.
Cyril Miller is one of purely social and philosophical Petrograd storytellers, creators of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller - a prominent man Petersburg avant-garde end of the 80th and early 90 years.
In addition, the city of man, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of citizens increases all spirits.
Recently picked up the hurdy-gurdy and became the Petrograd organist, because in this difficult role is ripe for his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, so why do you go around the city all in red and not yellow or turquoise for example?
- I chose the color red as a designer concerned with appearance and image.
In this world there is a red compromise between the artist and the public Imagemaker.
Although the general rule is that everything is just a little different from the gray, wake aggression and waking up bad qualities.
But my provocation aimed at that interview was established.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to debate.
- And when did you realize that you have to be an artist?
- The exhibition at the House of Culture on Nevsky, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is the way to go.
Then went the old liberal wave of unofficial artists and a new, free types of artists I could not understand.
I became friends with artists new wave of post - gazoněvskými who brought us the "Puškinské 10", and other waves have been.
Attracted me to the theater, dressing, music, all genres except in words.
- And it's all come together to form your art- clinic... - For me it was important to find himself in the center of culture Petersburg, where should gather all the best powers of creativity.
In 1995, I took place on 10 Puškinské, and there still existed before reconstruction musical art club, bohemian club, home petěrburkské bohemians.
There are many born : NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget to bring cord with the project "Van Gogh's Ear."
Lacing his friends sang the plywood light songs, dressed in a tight leotards, in the middle between composer Igor Vdovin, which is now in vogue.
When the band started playing live, became the "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg has led many programs hali - galivských times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus began his great career, basic education and training received by us.
Zatím nejsme schopni provádět překlad z jazyka „bosenština“ do jazyka „angličtina“.
This way they left our workers and our regular guests.
I'm the hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press, a special prize was "People in our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed I ended by my top.
In new times under the old rules work is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your works are characterized by a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which vividly captured the timeliness and discernment.
I have programmed the exhibition "Russian Museum in the Clowns".
Clowns are timeless categories.
Before, I used to be sociable, today be such a painful and horrible.
But clowns are all blurred, captures the tragedy.
I love slapstick tend to have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through a totalitarian disguise in a prescriptive order.
Today, people are confronted by clothing, focusing on the external drive, not the inner man.
Or maybe he can not shake hands and be spit in his face.
A delusion is removed cross-dressing.
- We recently saw you in the role of municipal organ grinder. - Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would it be, if not me?
- A commercial art can be beautiful?
- Currently should be commercially useful arts thorough, tactful, sweet.
Decaying cultures.
Previously, people gathered in groups, bohemian loved one, simply other people.
Today, everything broke on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill, I liked everything.
Today you need to think who is zalíbíte.
Today, every cultural hero of his 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes in several thousand spectators!
- The fans come to him, there is involved sexually social sphere.
A cultural land comes to 300 people and 10,000 of them will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything fades.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one is fooled and does not violate what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted these images in one collector hung on the wall along with Falk and Larionov.
I started with images, which people usually ends.
Today, people often confuse the terms.
They say, spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is elsewhere.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up with examples of artists who live in poverty and die in poverty, refused money for drawing pictures.
And I for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is lack in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept : Officer through culture.
Not all of them, but can handle the culture.
In ordinary times of the tsars was not so in all, the bar may not understand the culture, but understand the need to support real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
Here in St. Petersburg we have people who might be experts, but they are tucked in a corner somewhere because they need great experts who properly appreciate these experts and bring them to the right path.
Today prospers vkusovština.
Erarta same, but differ in that honestly say that not all accept modern art, there are artists who should seek other museums.
- What do you think Petersburg?
- Petersburg - not Capital of Culture in Moscow is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And our fallow the art of doing poorly.
We need a cultural land, but here is today more writers than readers, it is wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who love to go to shows and concerts.
For us it is such a weak layer.
We need to make art became fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented with grant funds St.Petěrburku
Fruiting in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans space vessels, with earthlings on board embark on a journey, looking for spare planet.
To save humanity, the essential question : how to keep his family in conditions of weightlessness or the backup plan?
I think the selection is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can acquire, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior researcher at the State PK Sternberg Astronomical Institute (SAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
While on Mars, but better conditions for life on Venus temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is only possible at high altitude or in orbit around Venus... in space.
Address issues of reproduction in space, scientists with the flora.
Already half a century ago we carried out experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their terrestrial relatives.
It was then carried to orbit delivery of insects - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979 was sent into space quail eggs to verify how the embryo develops in a state of weightlessness.
At the output we get absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find a foothold, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If you do not find a foothold, birds fall erratically and doing somersaults.
After 10 hours there was a freshly hatched birds to utter extinction instincts.
Birds did not react to light or sound.
A difficulty was that within four days just died.
"Twice we had hatched birds, but we refused because it is simply impossible for there to work with them," says failure experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarcha" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments continue.
In biosatelitu "Bion" but are only being one sex.
Experiment was conducted with rats, which were broadcast into space already pregnant.
In fact, there is nothing supernatural discovered.
"It was just biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be made," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground with the cosmic offspring born to rats.
To approach the problem of propagation in space has so far failed.
It is a difficult task.
Animals during loss of the normal environment simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
Human, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens reigns abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments performed.
But women flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest danger was Těreškovové.
Most precious thing that humanity has a woman's body.
Our seagull flew and no one on earth could not say whether withstand space flight.
Whether after such a flight can give birth to a child.
"But the question still no answer," says veteran rocket - space industry Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova - daughter.
The child's father was also a cosmonaut Nikolayev ANDRIJANA.
In 1988 was born the son of another woman - kosmonautce Svetlana teat, which visited orbit twice and that worked well in open space.
The risk remains.
We only have a few astronauts who, after long years born and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even when the orbital period," the pilot - cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Humanity still has inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is an obligatory step in preparation for flight.
Here in conditions of zero gravity the astronauts acquire the skills needed to work in an open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
Although adult water is even comfortable, but in a way, a strange environment for young children is a natural element.
Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is an average of nine months in the mother's amniotic fluid and it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, since the moment of birth, from the moment that first swim, pass only two weeks.
"It is very little that the child forgot something," says instructor baby swimming Marina Aksenovová.
In short - if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness natural state, it is natural for women inevitable gravitation, the attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness occurs very rapidly to decline abdominal muscles, pelvis, decreasing the body's ability to expel the fetus.
This can be set aside if they work stimulators muscle activity during childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the mother's body expels the fetus.
"And what else?" puts Valeri Polyakov complex issues.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
Unless the organism causing gravity, can not properly form the skeleton system or muscles.
Newborn orbit can not dress like an adult in a special suit with stress, in which he could train.
Just be deprived of what is essential to their development needs.
"If you go into the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, bring to Earth a disabled person who is utterly unsuited to the local environment," predicts head of the committee on bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So births in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
But one day the time will come when it becomes a reality when the earthlings issue in their Korab on a far planet, which will be home to their descendants born in the universe.
Chief SAO : Check Svarc system failed due to political
Czech is in respect of public good supervisors and good law, but lags in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálne.cz it says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct its applications - this is what our missing in my opinion," says the current situation Kala.
Similar findings also suggest joint control of Czech and German reviewers.
As an example of improper practice Petr Necas gives access to the so-called "Svarc system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother his business controls - it is banned or allowed?
"The law must be some setting after all, and if something is forbidden, so why is not the Prime Minister can not prevent the operation of the Authority, which has a duty to go check and enforce the obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies are talking about a joint project between the Czech and the German party under which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What specifically was it?
It is a parallel control, we started about two years ago.
Basically the point is that European legislation regulates how public procurement deal, followed by the various national legislations and also the actual practice.
We put all this together, even if control is not yet complete, we have shown interesting differences - generally speaking, our legislation is not "stronger and better", but the practice itself is in some parameters improved in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to create ever on and on precise rules, but you need to pay the actual application of the law.
What will this project can actually help you out of it for you then?
It is such a common control could help to make an effort to stop the refinement laws, reduction and refinement limits when it has such a positive impact.
Efficiency means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but this is not always the lowest) price in order to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by lowering the limit orders, which do not necessarily meet.
Maybe the system is overwhelmed by so many "paper" that those who are in the system they want to look for holes and those of which will draw much more easily than if they remained higher limit.
You're talking about domestic issues in translating legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is similar to our office SAO, or is it set differently?
What the authorities concerned, as there SAO works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, a form slightly different way, but basically both authorities proceed accordingly.
Also powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal structure and has the following audit offices and the Länder - in that the system is a little different from ours.
BRH can only control the federal money, here represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are managed in our regions and municipalities, there is control at the level of the federal courts of auditors.
As far as local legislation, so that it is easier than ours?
Generally I would not hate comparing specific data, but in some ways, Germany is known as a model, but you can definitely say that it is better at everything.
It is therefore necessary and that have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even countries that consider the pattern is facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, they would not offer any benefit to cooperate with our office, right?
With regard to domestic legislation, what your office meant the amendment of the Act on Public Procurement has somehow manifested its effects?
Given that the duration of this amendment is relatively short, so for us yet in control events does not occur.
Because we control ex post, it is necessary to count with some delay.
We see it not only in the preparation of future inspections - We have started our new tool "detection risk mismanagement", through which we ran the almost 14,000 contracts, and we analyzed them - there are of course those changes will manifest as a change limits, conditions some type of competition is adjusted and the like.
The approval of this Act therefore considered more benefits or more bureaucratic system load?
I think this law is definitely step in the right direction, and I hope to confirm this.
A problem that may arise here that she rules "tighten up" and can not be observed.
Have previous rules for the functioning of the controlled person committed to the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programs, regional council) that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act is a violation of budgetary discipline.
It therefore cost the law in this way tighten?
I do not think this way.
The system must exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal error which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And both of which thus out?
Let us show you which way is not the way.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneur controls the so-called "Svarc system" - what does it mean?
Švarcsystém is disabled or enabled?
The law must be some setting after all, and if something is forbidden, so why is not the Prime Minister can not prevent the operation of the Authority, which has a duty to go check and enforce the obligations.
You can say : "We will change the law and allow it", but can not say that we do not like that.
The law on public procurement are rather strict rules about how you should be formally done - which is properly to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best bidder is disqualified only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct its applications - this is what the us, in my opinion, is missing.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable
At several places in the Czech Republic as roads icy and snowy.
But mostly passable road, somewhere with caution.
Karlovarský place
In Karlovy Vary region were passable roads this morning, but sometimes icy and snowy.
The temperature dropped between five to ten degrees below zero during the day but slightly warmer.
Snowfall in the region stopped in the lowlands is just a thin layer.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains is about 30 inches of snow.
Here and there was even less visibility due to fog, seen from the data dispatching regional road racers.
R6 and communication first class in the region are now passable without restrictions.
Caution, however, is in place for example on some bridging, where the surface may be icy and slippery.
Passable roads are also all second and third class, including mountain roads.
On them, but in some areas there are the remains of frozen and sometimes off about snow.
Especially at higher altitudes should be paid attention to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralove Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia risk of frost, and at higher elevations in the mountains may be driving on roads covered with snow, informs on its website Directorate of Roads and Highways.
Road builders warn the driver before frost can form especially in the higher elevations of the Pardubice region.
Black ice can be around Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, shelves, or Svitav High Tolls, especially on the road second and third classes.
Chemically treated the road I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is mainly on roads and Giant Eagle Mountains.
Traveled snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in District of Trutnov and.
In East Bohemia is today mostly cloudy to cloudy with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, light breeze blowing.
Pilsen
Roads in the Region are passable this morning, but also with caution and driving must be adapted to the weather.

Road racer drove into the field at night snowfall, the Šumperk by administrators roads snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the county roads are generally passable without restrictions.
" The Šumperk is at the highest altitudes remnants of snow.
Snow on mashed Červenohorský drivers seat must count in the direction of Jesenik, " the dispatcher said today ČTK Šumperk Road Administration.
The terrain at night uttering their colleagues at Jesenice, e journey to the highest position they are now by the chemical treatment of bare and wet.
On Olomoucku roads are passable without limitation, the Sternberg would, however, drivers should be careful in the forest sections where roads remained wet.
Usti nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult navigable sites reported today in the morning road builders in northern Bohemia.
In addition, several sites with the fallen snow or ice is concluded with a mountain road from Telnice Knínice to the district, the results from the police database.
Temperatures are holding at lower altitudes below freezing, so ice and snow on roads apparently vydrží.V lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, while no problems are and the roads are generally dry.
Operating complications not yet reported.
The incidence of toothfish reported road builders especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, it was ideal conditions at night - during the day, rain and melting snow, the night clear and cold.
The main roads are reported to adverse conditions and on the road I/13 on the border of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec Region.

Simon Ornest : At the concert we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that he has less than a month be the end of the world?
It's just another alarmist which we humans love to catch them.
Together with his band The Tap Tap a makes it more fun, and we say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the end of the world to delay or prevent it.
In December, in addition to sort absolutely unique project of three concerts from around the world.
You can imagine readers closer?
It is a national fundraising event that we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential end of the Mayan calendar announced for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
Before the 20th day December, from 21 hours to 3 concerts take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Ending will be about the time when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in a time zone 12 hours ahead, the Mayan calendar ends.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we are all up together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also together with the public think about the condition of this world once we pass to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have created a unique collection of objects shoes, shirts, bags or original germ of the world against the purchase at www.e - tap.cz us humans can also support.
The Tap Tap Group together with other artists also sang the national anthem against the so-called end of the world, which is called "End of the World canceled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, you will hear also of benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, so if we all can not occur and the end of the world...
Sing it all performers in all three concerts simultaneously.
Anthems suddenly interconnects also in a unique live on Czech Television.
The lyrics to the song and wrote the lead role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomas Hanak also sings in her Xindl X...
How did you get them to cooperate?
We work with other personalities Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we hold a lot of charity events and concerts...
We try to intensively involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them working with us interested and entertained.
What proceeds from the concert will go to the end of the world?
Barrier-free facilities at the educational center STUDEO that you realize sixth year with the civic association Tap in an institution.
For students Jedlicka Institute regularly attend lecturers and engaged them in activities that are fun and interesting.
The students themselves do not have the means to set out for teachers themselves, we strive to enable them thus in this way.
The completion Jedlicka Institute in future there will be a separate building in which to move on with this project.
At each concert will be several musical groups and artists.
Based on what you selected them?
We have tried to compile a program that will appeal to all ages, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy.
All details can be found on www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic action" in the future?
In May, we will first perform at the Prague Spring Festival, so i will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year we would also like to play in the Czech National Hall in New York, and I personally, when you are in USA, I would like to affiliated with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you have already performed such as Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of disabled people.
How you handle these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it first seems.
We have five members on an electric wheelchair, its trucks must travel in the cargo area, as well as, obviously vláčíme large amounts of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far it has always been managed without any problems, CSA and British Airways to us were well prepared that I have to wonder how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks výjezdům abroad can compare how each differs in wheelchair accessibility, public access to the handicapped and the like.
What you have not met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Russia that the East is all still in the very beginning.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is a barrier, there is still unusual for a person to an electric wheelchair could move downtown.
Not there either so commonplace as to be wheelchair users prefer the elevator.
Fortunately, there also arise civic association that seeks to problems of people with disabilities alert.
And what on the other hand we still have to catch up with developed countries?
There are many things in which we are still behind...
But it is important to note that the improvement and enhancement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid is quite common that even people with severe disabilities to move independently of the public can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very usual that there would be large numbers of people with disabilities actively participated in social life, in that we are contrary to The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public and wheelchair accessibility is one thing but once in a while, when one of us will be prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, and things really begin to change.
There are rare cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years back what you made in 1998 to establish her?
I started as a tutor to Jedlicka Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to pursue.
And since I am myself a musician, playing the saxophone, among other things, so I founded along with fellow hobby musical ring.
And over time, we, as our moderator says Lada Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughs).
The popularity but came up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us when we started to connect with famous singers and actively work to promote the band.
We figured that the work is not seen as basically would not exist.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, moreover we can afford quality instructors, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it to The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning I felt the potential that they can do something else.
Showbusiness is chock full of things where one imitates the other.
It's kind of logic, new everything is taken care and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of someone who sees us for the first time, of course, regret, it is natural...
But the pity is totally useless because people with disabilities are no abandoned all suffering beings, which we regret.
These are people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming of course that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if something can people with disabilities, so it is not just a shift for them, but for the whole society.
This success helped also that you have a strict boss, how many people have you said?
When we do good work, we must be uncompromising in many cases require a certain discipline.
But I think it is perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion as head in the clouds, and when they find that they have two weeks to rehearse, attend and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, so is enthusiasm quickly leaves.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently the band The Tap Tap twenty members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We're a group of people come and go, it can not be avoided.
Who has the will and desire, we always have an open door
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21 hours
Held in Prague Incheba arena, Fleda Brno and Ostrava gasholder participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities are at the end of the evening teleconference link in the joint singing songs the band The Tap Tap "End of the World canceled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds to equip the multi -barrier educational center STUDEO at Jedlicka Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 are admitted free tickets in advance Bohemiaticket
Polsko a Kosmos.
Last week was the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency adopted for Poland twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as the second country of the former Eastern bloc countries (the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years participated in a number of projects agency.
But the journey to Poland cosmos began much earlier.
Flight into space is devoted to Polish fans before the Second World War, but not always met with understanding.
Think, for example A. Sternfeld lecture in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which 6th December 1933 represented the ideas of his groundbreaking work Access to Space.
Ideas young engineer (b. 1905) let the audience cold and after years Sternfeld recalled that only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld in 1934 won for Access to Space in France the price of Robert Esnault - Pelterieho André and Louis Hirsch.
Remembering Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
In Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and has written a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became world famous promoter of Astronautics and his contribution was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built rail trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and there is no project details.
It is not clear whether the missile should be used to start or trolleys to contain it.
About this trolley are known only from the press.
Since 1933, the rocket projectiles began to entertain the Polish artillery.
Research provided closet Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfkem and prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegim.
The surviving material is evident that research has reached a stage prakzických tests.
But the arrival of German troops research was interrupted.
In 1937 he appeared in professional journals proposal photoelectric fighter missiles, designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year published work launchers - torpedo powietrzna and rakietobomba Lotnicza author Leliwy - Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects use military rocketry devoted Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradcza - Naukowe), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years the activities of its activity ended the war.
Other works devoted to aerospace after the war in the Polish press appear thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
First is the mention of the company in the November issue of the journal Year 1954 problems, which are four comprehensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicze is proposed to establish a company that will deal with the series.
At that time, radiating projects artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) seek to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded 1951) and in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA contributed significantly to the development of the highly successful RM meteorological rockets (rockets Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which has conducted scientific research.
The first type RM -1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on 10 října 1958.
Rocket with ceiling was 1,800 m long, about 80 cm and its weight was less than 5 kg.
It was later built an enhanced version RM - 1A and summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovské two-stage missile flight test RM - second
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development you should be able to real science - rocket RM -34 should have ceilings up to 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the winds aloft.
However, in 1962 the other on hold.
The successor to the first missiles RM has become a racket Meteor -1 developed from 1962 to 1965th
The rocket was conceived as a two, its total length was 510 cm and a starting weight was 32.5 kg.
They were developed three types (denoted Meteor - 1A - 1B -1C), which differed in the size of the area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor missile -1A was space available on 0.4 liter, Meteor - 1B by volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor - 1C with a capacity of 0.62 liters.
The maximum ceiling for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 took place in the Aviation Institute of rocket development Meteor -2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket Meteor -2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently built version of Meteor and Meteor - 2H - third
It is also necessary to mention Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also in the Intercosmos program participated in the research space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem.
Repeal of the Act on public works is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
Resolution led to a lively public discussion.
Certainly it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal -oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalized world are based on multiple, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the individual economic formations national economic systems, is in permanent conflict between them.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, unfettered movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the considerable differences in labor cost (wages) is to price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation, where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods meet competition by "trips" cost competitor to pull down on a greater share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.
On a mass scale, it is for most entrepreneurs either translate into production abroad or there cheaply buy or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where the cost of labor in comparison with other economies high.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for it and produced by unemployment, rising social expenditures necessarily state.
The situation is enhanced by the sheer unwillingness of Lords entrepreneurs pay taxes and to replace the economic and social damage that society as a whole in the pursuit of profit has done.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to indicate the specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital in the form of economies situation where governments are forced to enter into competition with one another in order to artificially reduce the welfare of their own people in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital risking their own population, regardless of social decline.
This is reflected mainly in changes in applicable laws.
The aim is economically forcing its own people received dictate the price of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.
This happens first set of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by limiting the rights of employees in employment law.
The result is growing poverty, along with the increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany there are many years of public dispensaries food for the poor, who can not support their own work.
Number of people go into the millions already.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is quite common to cases that properly employed people receive a wage that they must pay the price to become subsistence.
Such a scandal was made public in the case of auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.
Austerity virtually all southern States will undoubtedly lead to the same state when people are under pressure catastrophic decline in social standards either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or eke out a living for starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that the country will come perhaps once private investment capital.
It is necessary, however, but might wonder where it comes?
If it is from other EU countries, the poverty moves from one country to another, or not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian or Turkish, Moroccan or Egyptian, African, or still work for a fraction of the wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media ad nauseam argues that the state can not participate in private capital economy, that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity stubbornly to insist that the state should not interfere with management interventions into the economy.
You then need to ask whether private capital does not affect, now actually control policy and the entire state of self- egoistic sense.
Here is the definitive answer that yes.
The proof of the existence of virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislature, where almost all reprehensible, but not criminal.
In Germany the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds outsource the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are frequently in conjunction with industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power thus does not come from the people how to advocate Western-style constitution, but the financially powerful groups prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal- oriented democracy now quickly get into a situation as described by Appian in his book Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey : "The state has long been in the full decomposition and authorities manned violence.
Bribes, illegal obtaining favors and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption thrived without any inhibitions and people went to the polls with a pre- sold voice "..." decent people will not run for office at all, so once was a result of the breakdown of the state was eight months without consuls "...." It started with really talk about it, that the only remedy in bad situation autocracy and the need for a vigorous man.. " Appian Although thought of Pompey, but it became Caesar, who turned into lasting democracy to autocracy.
Conclusion As in the ancient world, the current company based on the preference of reckless self-interest, regardless of societal interest.
Private capital is already inherently able to understand and apply the societal benefit.
The result is now the same as if unexampled elite decadence without any attempt at reform goes deeper.
Causality onset of fascist and communist regimes must therefore seek the indiscriminate liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20 century.
In the current state of these systems can demise in favor of liberal democracy type considered as a break with the expectations next round.
Particularly devastating is the fact that the current elite completely ignored in the future to hundreds of thousands of casualties, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we now witness along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repeal of the Act on public works is not an option, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition, both at international and European level, the Interior of the Czech Government forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the welfare of the population.
This trend is therefore a system.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, will strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of the private capital of the State.

After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, emerge as a lot of reactions.
One is for Israel, argue its right to self-defense and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue Israeli state racism, genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in periodic waves of killing the perpetrators and the victims who, after all, today's residents of Israel, including the self-governing territory were born to the current political situation and the onset of violence experienced.
My point is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain look at who primarily has served 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts are some of them derived based on my own understanding of who respectively. What group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is if it were always those individuals who autonomously guided their actions and or whether their throne stood someone who directed the actions of the pre- defined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and resulting power will not occur in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families juts one that could be considered a squid head (if there is someone above them do not know, but do not rule it) - Rothschieldové.
I really do not write about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) bought back in 90 the 19th century to stop linking its name with high criminal deeds in the background stood for them always meant consolidating power, increased wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks of the world and against the countries where the share of the central bank not to lead or preparing wars (Afghanistan against attacks were 7 countries after invading Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi was reduced to four, but in the meantime Russia subordinate to the Central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defy the family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank Rothschieldově Bank of America began during the Civil War to issue its own (read: government) money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began issuing its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after the Fed wanted to sue for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate plans three world wars Mason High, 33 levels of initiation Albert Pike.
The first war was tasked to remove a monarchical government units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial domination in particular the United Kingdom and the third has lead to the reduction of world population somewhere in the 0.5 - 1 billion people (as many slaves for their comfort and luxury and do not consume enough many sources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than foreground for such a solution), and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method the group 's wealthiest families headed by Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed to repeat crisis like the one that sparked in 1907).
So, after they managed assassination of the Habsburg heir to the throne RU Ferdinand in Sarajevo unleash the First World War, destroyed the Tsarist Russia starting the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unfounded, the capitulation of Germany (there was no need for war, destruction of Czarist Russia) and was subsequently fragmented Central Powers, Austria-Hungary.
For ease of unleashing the Second World War left the bankers policies create latent conflict situation by the fact that Germany had imposed huge war reparations, which created a presumption of radicalization impoverished masses and then they had to do was slip the Germans sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions vendor and leader creating a multinational Czechoslovakia strong German minority that should play, and I played, the fifth column, the ignition of the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century instigated Rothschieldové founding Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration paved the way for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine began to experience the first conflict with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke if Hitler tore off the chain, where he initially held the international bankers, and all I did was plan is difficult to predict in any case suffering of European Jews in concentration camps create prerequisites for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like war reparations Germany was off to WW2, was the announcement of the state of Israel created the third outbreak of war.
If it manages to unleash the international bankers, the Jewish nation, as in the other, the victim in the front line fighting, now together with Arab or Muslim population in general Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (Consider just how sharply divided people into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, though at the beginning there was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish between ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, like with us, podstrkují international bankers people a choice in the election exclusively own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is typical fascistic circles, the international bankers loyal, someone who does everything to make war with Iran, which, due to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict because of the control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, which carry 20% of the world's oil (shipping corridor is only two miles wide) as well as the destruction of the world economy.
In light of what now appears to words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 : "All you need is a general crisis and people will accept the new world order."
New World Order in their vision of the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population used the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where everyone is a newly born individuals chip implanted at birth, which will make it a totally controlled entity.
" And he causeth all both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have his right hand or on their foreheads, so that man might buy or sell, who is not labeled with the name of the beast or the number of his name.
It is necessary to understand : who hath understanding count the number of either of the beast.
This number identifies a person and is the number six hundred sixty-six. "
Film Argo : When it is worst, calling for Hollywood
In November 1979 a crowd of demonstrators occupied the Islamist students U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
Should be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the U.S., the patron of his regime for decades.
Situation for the U.S. administration did not offer a positive basis - throw overboard the Shah could not afford it, because it would fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
Release of the hostages but in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, were unable to reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, later deepened fiasco attempt to free the hostages by force.
Imprisonment diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
They do at home sparked a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the presidential election of 1980.
Film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that America has brought small victories.
Just before the occupation of the embassy staff fled six.
After a complicated end up at the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to get them out of Iran, helped yet extravagant cover story - went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country surveyed locations for filming sci - fi epic.
Combining genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez, required cooperation and Hollywood.
To legend was credible, wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, held a press conference fictitious production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, also called "caper movie," the story vydařeného bit, Sting - example might be a series of Ocean's Eleven.
In the film, so alternating moods - on the one hand, the documentary conceived sequence of Tehran (in credits of the period are shown iconic photographs of events and the way in which the same situation is demonstrated in the film - big differences in how not).
On the other hand, lighter passages from Hollywood, papers ironically a slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in hallways office phone...
Ben Affleck is remarkably managed to restart career.
For ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, the dark crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first film Affleck, who does not take place in the director's home Boston.
Feel for the atmosphere of the place yet was one of the characteristics that the director's earlier films haughty above the Hollywood standard.
A Affleck him reflected in Argos, where Tehran "plays" in Canada.
The best scene in the movie takes place in the streets, in reconstructing the actual event - the fall of the embassy opening sequence is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotion and confusion nepřevídatelnosti that arise when someone suddenly move history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are making in fictional scenes (fake crew on Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that narrated the story really does not offer much in terms of exciting movie scenes.
Quite successful with it almost works, sometimes a little přimyslí to reality - where it all comes out so gracefully (the scene in which the looming crisis in Tehran airport turn call in America and chase down the runway has pretty far-fetched).
Argo is a weakness but restlessness arising from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in roles Hollywood collaborators indeed very charming and their characters but would deserve more space and not in the film is far from the only one.
Affleck film loses a bit of dramatic tension, it is the image jejž can watch with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation and retro style evocative thrillers 70th years.
Grabbing but hardly.
As a reminder yet somehow living history and evidence of how overblown the concept of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services but will suffice.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
Server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces contest for the most ridiculous bank fees have now decided to launch a competition for the "most ridiculous regulation or ideas from the workshop of the EU".
"She led us to the last event, the EU plans to take a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik right of the organizer polls Nacher.
Among the nominees already absurdities as the recent decision of the European Court of unification premium rates for men and women.
So far, while the women were at prices discounted life insurance, because insurance companies are objectively less risky.
" Another incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can nominate people to the end of this year.
The actual voting will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulation is necessary and mandatory blending of biofuel in the fuel, which in turn harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or of the size of a hen cage, which this year due to significantly more expensive eggs.
Also faced criticism earlier de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or retirement from the sale of incandescent light bulbs.
Quality bananas should have 14 cm
EU apparatus often made under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby, the requirements in Brussels usually defend a State or group of States (Czech and now the threat of veto forth the requirements of your bank).
Interests lobby was worth it, for example, bananas have the highest quality in the Union, minimum length 14 cm and were not allowed to have "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission is hampering that only harmonize the existing fragmented national standards that complicate trading.
Standards for fruit and vegetables, the EU despite the opposition of some states softened with reference to the existing directive lead to food waste.
Candidate to win the poll may be the last year of the EU Regulation which must be sold in balloons obligatory warning that children under 8 years must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU appealed to the U.S. research, according to which the balloons toys leading cause of death for children from suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 years old when blowing into fairground frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born at home
Quite absurd is then the rule concerning themselves with European officials - anyone who has an EU official function, not with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia, Greece and must instead talk about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire voted in the poll except for some of the above absurdities even the EU regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum amounts of food stocks that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
Czech then crossed as fixed amounts for canned mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a heavy fine.
Organizers of the survey was also interested in the idea of pay for certain countries that do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to a request for a grant.
These ideas, however, incurred in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the absence of the sea.
Ask the EU for a refund, "he said in autumn 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As the argument stated that with us yielded a lot of grain and as a result the intervention purchases had become full of warehouses that had to be exported.
After that, the Czech continue to ports, we should EU by Palas pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally published the Czech Republic meet that organized the tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Aid for obtaining grants offered to municipalities Ministry for Regional Development managed by the Minister Pavel Nemec (US- DEU), in particular should go on writing applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU : Bizarre Regulation, except
Although the regulation in the Member States easily become a target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and also the efficient functioning and development throughout the Union according to many experts deserve more recognition.
The more serious problem, according to experts such as use of EU funding for projects that have even a hint of something to do with the deepening of European integration, but which in budget negotiations necessitated by Member States.
Arouses emotions between Bohemia and that, just like other countries of the Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to the specific identification of their traditional products, while not always in the match succeeds.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians defended sign Olomouc curd cheese, but domestic rum, a tradition here goes back to the 19th century, they had to rename our manufacturers to rum.
Naming rum can carry only products of cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.
The official list of registered products in the EU of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany or Parma ham, for example, have found themselves Carlsbad crackers, Pohořelický and carp and Saaz hops.
EU trade mark can then also boast Pardubice gingerbread and wafers.
People want to saving the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, as a man think that he wants to run for president?
It is not my intention to be a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, so do not run anywhere.
But I can not watch the last twenty years the country stolen, the thieves as they run, people are increasing taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I like, so I try to come up with a solution how to change it.
And since I was already forty and I am an independent non-party, I have no way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
In the Senate you're getting, but soon you went to the Castle.
Do not turn it back to the people who elected you?
The whole time I was saying that the fight goes to the castle result in the Senate election.
Later, I explained that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.
My goal but not function, the tool is, how can I make my vision.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not only that as a nation swear in the pub and television, but they trample anyone who wants to try to change.
To do this, add media that dehonestují a man who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
About to be claimed that uplácím journalist or that I was an adviser to Paroubek.
Let's go to your vision.
The fight for the Castle have started with the thesis material and criminal responsibility of politicians and return of equity returns over twenty million.
To do this, you must change the law.
As president, but you do not have such authority and the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you solve it?
When I was a citizen lobbied for that guiding was free trade, managed to push through.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good design from the left or from the right, on purpose to refuse to citizens and resident.
As an independent non-party have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that no party label and dogmas can I take what is best for our country, on each side, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech point of view it seems to me, that my people are going more to the left.
For me it is not important if a little left or a little to the right.
For me it is important for us to go forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.
Always publicly support it any good solution, although it suggests Communist Party or ODS, and so am against bad idea.
Čertíte when someone says about you, that you are populist.
But it does not prove what you say?
When you create byznysplán in the company, and also have a perfect aim and vision.
And we try to approach it.
Some may call it populism, but all suggestions, I'm talking about you in the world of work, or talking about them prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament you're left with just your password.
And with that a long time in politics not be enough.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them that you can impose such criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Persuading politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on your side to enforce it.
If I were elected president, there is no problem to hold televised live broadcast, which will ask the chairman of the parliamentary parties to enact substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they would possibly have to tell her why they do not want.
When the strong personality that will name the ills can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was thanks to public pressure.
Frankly I say that I am an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For their views and visions I'm looking for allies.
In politics, I just started and your program will try to get majority support.
Things I try to push myself, unless it does not work, for six years finish and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like he Okamura Czech save.
I'm no savior.
I know that one person will not do anything, so I walked around a number of well-known people that would also stand as candidates for the Senate.
I went Radim Jančura, due to the amount of work declined.
So at least I supported investigative journalist John Lorencová that go beyond the fraud with light heating oil.
I ran to the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm having second thoughts.
Sixty percent of the people could not vote, and those who followed, the majority of elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, so we are only two independent.
People dialed the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for your vision, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about setting up their own party?
O that I had not thought, because I do not have time to read the past I examined each potential party member, and even I do not have money.
I do not have money for a presidential campaign in my transparent account is only 20,000.
Do not have money?
You're talking about equity returns, what's yours?
Private property estimated at about 60 million.
In Prague, I land about 25 million, ten million apartment, apartment for another eight million art collection of about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb per million and then I have a few million in the account.
Anyway Aston Martin I, because it was my childhood dream come true - I always liked James Bond, who was riding in the car, was courteous to women, and to fight against evils and abuses.
Do you drive Aston Martin, have assets of 60 million and have no money to campaign?
You say you want to change Africa, but their own money into it you do not want to give too much.
It is not very convincing.
I have 15 million on the campaign.
That I have debt?
The campaign I ran was 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, suggests that about my program is probably not that interested.
A campaign is under no obligation to pay on their own.
Campaign costs me basically covers what I would senatorial salary.
But it would nevyžil, for example, I could not pay the son of an English school, which is 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, so do not run anywhere.
So you continue to do business, you might live?
Did you know that these activities mute?
But it is not related to salary.
As promised, my activities I am partially allayed.
For example, the managing director of travel agency in the spring becomes my agent.
People would like me to be a Samaritan, who will save the Republic.
But I also need to make a living.
How much you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.
And if I were president, I would have ended their business.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday issue of rights.
Architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not take place only in your head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 shots
"The building seems cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, it again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig that goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says : "Of course, the house is nice."
But I ask, what today we need a library.
All have internet, iPads and e-books.
Do any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily nobody goes, do you?
Spijkenisse, housing close to Rotterdam without their own jobs that are not worth visiting, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, was made a few years ago determination to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted miniatures fictitious concrete bridges that are shown on the euro banknotes.
Success coaching education but was not giddy.
A municipal councilor and know that there 's only one way to become masters of statistics : we have the library!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architects MVRDV, master insanely brave bar graphs and contractor witty, often even cynical buildings, received the usual thing with ease and at competitive conduct in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the Commission still amazed looking around, shrugging his shoulders, piling cheeky Maas his gifts to each according to their size and activist reasoned speech ended by the words "Dear urban village!"
So this is my proposal for a mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later the mountain for 30 million euros piled.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the mountain of books awarded second place in "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Provincial gray, which still could not offer more than post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly city hall, for which the white facade would rather expect dairy is richer thanks to a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however now Spijkenisse first public building in the cultural history of their existence.
Long way to book
First impression: reading Eldorado under the cover cheese.
Means massive mountains while riding an elevator, but the actual room and reading to discover a passion for hiking fighting topography.
From all sides glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt clinker and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog, and boys and girls who play football.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally standing bookcases along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is usually dingy and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We classical spatial configuration built upside down and space for readers, we ejected from the inside out.
The interior mountains of books is cleverly utilized : in the center there are offices, online library, chess club, environmental center and switchboard building technology.
A special delight are black bookshelves, which are one -paneled walls, one parapet and sometimes railings.
Appearance, texture and smell acts strange.
Above unknown building materials shaking their heads even sworn architects and construction engineers.
"We are here to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at urban village Spijkenisse, on request Standard magazine.
So we are in a Fresian farm one day come across a suitable waste product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands used as a substrate for millimeter- roots non-woven synthetic material.
It is cheap and time efficient.
Thin fabrics will last one or two seasons and then is ready for ejection into bulky waste.
The library was fleece - for the first time in this amount - pressed down on the boards with a thickness of four inches.
The action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns in a dark, homogeneous and resilient material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs to get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 meters long journey you will be rewarded not only literary cafe fantastic views of the city, but also the Dutch croquettes and rubber plants in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but about the proper humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for new soul
"You will not believe, but this house is in spite of many glass surfaces exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heats and cools the earth's heat.
Although Hora books is under a glass cover, the sun shines in a short time, even in sunny days.
Wide laminated wood trusses that stand perpendicular to the glass façade serves as shading and captures much of the solar radiation.
Room climate is very pleasant.
With the rest of the handle fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, has visited the new library.
In Lisette Verhaar už tame byla.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even referred to as "long awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason : every resident of the city a few weeks ago invited to the opening to devote one book from his personal collection.
Should thus first be filled optical gaps still not fully equipped library, which currently stands at 70,000 units.
The concept worked.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think our invitation now has a new house every inhabitant of a relationship.
Everyone knows that the book is part of the building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
This MVRDV zadařilo the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon of identity formation.
Spijkenisse written history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
It is then the starting point for identity.
Szabo : "The Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained when deciding on Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the U.S. and Europe by Stephen Szabó Berlin teetering on the fine line of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle : Germany earlier this week, first signaled that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinians observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo : Germany does not support what Israel did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel prudent.
But at the same time I would not support either the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came oo establishing a no-fly zone.
Here nakonec prosadilo NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take on major international issues clear position?
Yes, it's true.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy and the direction of policy, which was managed by the USA, so to speak, towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is made more difficult because the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.
Germans are therefore between two fronts.
It is expected from them, they will play independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think the only settle into his role, but are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, which are in France or the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It shows readiness play in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitude of the U.S. or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, ie exports and its relationship with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent non-economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
They had economic interests influence the attitude of the Middle East conflict and vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a large outlet in the Middle East, particularly in states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to deterred the public, but the elite in the Arab countries.
Absolutely plays a role.
I would not want it but not to ascribe too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
It plays an important role, however, in any event, in German considerations.
Damaged relations with Germany, USA, when Germany for two important decisions abstained from voting, such as voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA good deal of understanding for the German attitude.
Therefore, I do not think it was such a dramatic turning point as the issue of Libya.
Perhaps from Germany that even chop some respect.
This fact indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
USA on the other hand clearly in favor of a veto.
Exist between the United States and many European nations differences?
These differences existed due to internal American politics always.
I think the Obama administration has secretly considerable understanding about the European position.
But due to the political situation there can not of course hold this position publicly.
I think the difference of opinion really are not as big as it always seems.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not at all seem very enthusiastic about Netanyahu policy.
It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the U.S. on one side and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that precisely this that makes it difficult for the Germans.
For the Germans it was of course a bit easier by a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
They can not therefore be part of a broader line and must instead drive things forward from his own position.
Surely they are doing with the euro.
I believe in the future of Germany takes a leading role and will push Europe into European attitudes.
For Germany, of course, is not easy, not least the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play an independent role.
Germany sees itself as an important international player? He wants to take the lead role at all?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany it still is not used, it's still annoying, and for the country, for obvious reasons, is still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany take a bigger role, resulting anti-German sentiment.
It 's making things easier for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, in Germany more difficult position than the USA.
It must be acceptable to various neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.
U.S. influence in European politics now steadily declining, EU, however, this vacuum is currently blank. Who's else is there?
Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, they are uncomfortable and makes it much 's most popular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, institute, where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together studying the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
For this is hidden label that is entirely in China officially registered, but the original company does not have anything in common.
However, enjoys protection so long as the true owners nezažalují brand.
And even then it is not clear whether domohou rights.
"For foreigners it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of the rights of the Far East.
Each week lands on my desk a new case.
Counterfeiters just a couple of extra letters so that they can log your brand.
From brands such as Gucci and becomes Lu- Gucci and Prada instead have it registered Prada - Kny.
In this way, legally copied and German companies, like sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file with records Trademark Office in Beijing.
14th September 2010 there have left one Chinese company to protect brand Zegna DF Puma. Artificial name that prey on fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and infringement of intellectual property rights.
In large cities are multilevel stores, which are almost exclusively sold fakes.
Pattlochovy however, are different. On behalf of their agents shall proceed against the Chinese company received from the Trademark Office officially quite right to use the name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai" associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
This is meant to women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"Damaging to trade, we have to fight," invites Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, image damage is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs affected Sectors go into the millions, especially for precious demonstrators.
According to data from market research firm CLSA China with 15 billion euros per year, the third-largest luxury goods market and the market, which is growing rapidly.
Deletion of the offending entries in the index marks can be difficult to achieve, however, and it costs money.
Management may take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the action because the name was criticized for a long period of time "market reality".
When the plaintiff unlucky plagiarist must still pay because the damage its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Known cases pertain to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with a construction machinery manufacturer Sany, now, who recently took over the German pump manufacturer Putzmeister concrete mix.
The Chinese therefore still may use the emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used blue and white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely logo had changed.
Manufacturer of fashion items Lacoste lost to counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile who turned in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
CTMO Trademark Office acknowledges that in 2010 there were shortcomings because of too few staff and space.
But last year, said "the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell 22 percent.
Closed 57 were 000 such cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting for the office still 81,500 complaints pending.
Something to take it is expensive
As is often the case in China, are impressive numbers.
Last year CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, which is nearly a third more than in 2010.
That's a record and it means China for the tenth time in a row leads the list of new applications worldwide.
This is also true for the number of valid trademark - there are a total of 5,500,000.
In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
It simply means that each log, on average, worth 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Start against litigation costs several times as shown in the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
The firm has more than seven years of fighting the Chinese forgers.
Germans were achieved that were canceled its illegal manufacture of imitation car parts.
However, the forger clinched Chinese rights to the brand Freudenberg continue.
Sami we failed, because in Germany last name can not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
Trademark Office CTMO then also rejected the plea of the Munich company.
In two other instances, although Freudenberg achieve right, but the defendant in a dispute struggles continue to this day.
It must be terrible to give careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says : "Management is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs can not be quantified. In the archives of the company even had to see a century-old writings, to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg counterparty vainly offered a "high six-figure euro amount" in order to settle the dispute.
"From this we see what it means to us," says Wentzler.
There is the danger of hitting the Far East and Europe.
And in this case, when there imitators provide a generic brand.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted in Germany Freudenberg login sign for shoes and leather.
This area of business concern long ago gave up, still managed to avert registration.
"It is necessary to pay attention terrible," says Wentzler.
He also Pattloch lawyer advises German businesses to be in business with China very careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners would rather have "anything in any way worth protecting, log in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the picture.
Indeed : if the company Freudenberg in the last act of his drama, succumb to brand, then you probably will have to pay royalties to the counterparty in its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we pushed in the disputed segment of the market.
World AIDS Day : stomping, singing, help
In Heidelberg tested Corps Imbongi - and Swaziland makes them happy orphans of parents who died of AIDS.
The story of connection that surpasses more than 8,733 km.
First there is the stomping : cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' and men's loafers heels looking at the floor beat and quickly located.
One -two- three-four.
Then slowly run high singers' voices - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - urging, Mom and mutually prosecute.
29 year old conductor Fiete Hopf almost rises from its textile shoes when combines supple voice to their wild gestures.
It's Monday evening. The Music Hall Institute of Medical Psychology at Heidelberg tested Corps Imbongi new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years, researchers from human genetics to the caretaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each voice choir has a different text, and especially in a foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and parts.
Help to self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that the world population is about 34 million people are infected with HIV.
Of the 23.5 million living in South Africa.
In Swaziland, the 245,000 orphans of parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans of parents who died of AIDS in the village Esitjeni found association Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attended high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month can take patronage.
Guarantees child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at Gogo - center.
Imbongi means in Zulu language "storyteller" or "one who praises".
Bantuštinou not fluent in this area no one to speak, just sing.
For nearly a decade choir rehearsing songs in the foreign language soft and sometimes it also brings back to where originally come from: south Africa.
The air distance 8733 km from Heidelberg is in the Northeast Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which depends on the cardinality of votes German congregation.
Forty percent are infected
He lives there about 2000 people, some still in plain mud or straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, as they succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjeni is seen in a small, throughout the ailing Swaziland highest rate of HIV infections of the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland wears virus weakened immunity in itself. Is not rare to die in less than thirty years.
This village choir appeared at the joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, members Imbongi saw many children on the streets, which not only lacked parental care, but clean everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed school education in poor countries have had no chance at all.
Initially, it was still private use of individuals, who for a few euros per year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But a year later he was planting a church group "Voices for Africa" , which has since cares for orphans of parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted disease?
The bacterial SPI belong syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral SPI are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Munk and parasitic mites belong to the SPI.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found primarily among men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis were reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
For heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydial infection, Trichomonas, Candida (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
HIV among heterosexual adults in our extended relatively few, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV accounted for by this group.
Among adolescents with chlamydial infections occur much more frequently than other groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections involving young people 15 to 25 years.
For us, moreover, often occur among adolescents human papillomaviruses.
As the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases should be reported.
Number infected with syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 from the disease in 2001 more than doubled to 3698 the disease in 2011.
Number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007 decreases.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It is about one- tenth less than the year before.
What signs point to an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
Often, however, do not cause pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The risk of infection can reduce the condoms, however, offer one hundred percent protection.
For agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted and infection from dirt and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially for frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis can cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to sponsorship, charitable donations, and last but not least honorářům that earns the choir singing throughout Germany, to collect some money.
"In total, we have to Esitjeni sent around 200,000 euros," said association President Annette Lennartz.
Manages money from Germany in the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who is able to enforce.
It also takes care of the orphaned children found shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the Zulu language, says the old women are the backbone of the village.
Some of them even took 14 orphans, gave them shelter and care to ensure that the children came the time every day in uniform to school.
Children who do not have anyone, they go to the shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman paid by the association as well as two cookbooks, cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" in addition established a sewing school, built two coops and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had to do an HIV test.
It is not granted. Although the disease in the country so obvious about it all is silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."
Actually quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch black Africa, King Mswati III., Is known for its nemírným lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned way of life carries among others to blame for the HIV virus in the past decades and spread rapidly.
But many migrant laborers virus spread throughout the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are everywhere on free, " but no one is in use.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "
To at least some support cultural exchange, traveling choir Imbongi once every two or three years together after South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, militancy, trust and confidence in the future of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent known from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - this award not only brings humor and joy, but also has elicited tears of many wild frontier soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit children over which they have patronage.
Although this village barely see the maps in the valley Ezulweni is more than familiar.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," say the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, who is here as the crow flies 8,733 km to dupajícím singers in rehearsal at Bergheimer Straße, you see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA objevila na Merkuru suffered
Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that the ice on the planet Mercury.
Ice sheet could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the specialist magazine "Science".
Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that in this planet that lies in permanent shadow, there is ice cover.
It is reportedly at least 30 cm, and maybe even up to 20 meters thick.
This water apparently came from comets or perhaps from asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
Should not give, but finding ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
Temperature of Mercury may be up 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we could help to explain how water and other basic elements of life given to other areas of the solar system.

One of the largest and sharpest images Hubble Telescope : The Whirlpool Galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies according to their color become real works of art.
Shot published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light years away Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
Trifid name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trigeminal) as a dark dust lane divided glowing heart of this stellar nursery into three parts.

Our eyes to the universe: the most important telescopes
Telescope supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Prior to Galileo Galilei one year later it used to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes continued to expand - and looks that convey are still deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had an average of five meters.
V Large Binocular Telescope Stojic Americka Arizona.

However, its diameter is roughly eleven meters.
Disadvantage inexpensive method of construction: telescope is provided hákovadlem in elevation angle, thereby limiting their mobility.

His specialty is high luminous flux amplification.
This is despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror equals the largest mirror telescopes of the world.

Ride the mountain Talyš can call wildly romantic.
Minibus rattled down the road with many bends along the densely wooded hills, wild rivers and affordable farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, it almost seems that we are in the Black Forest.
But this here is the furthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives Talyšů Caucasian ethnic group, of which it is not widely known, except that perfectly speaks Persian and Azerbaijani and lives to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is a picturesque mountain landscape somehow fit.
Tourists from Europe do not go here. Check the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
At 323 km is needed eight hours because the road is single lane only.
Fabulous wealth for the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea, here in the country has not yet arrived.
Pilata Fatullayev (48) is convinced, however, that the Lerik it to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May famous Eurovision Song Contest - and the next year we will have a festival oldest people in the world," says Fatullayev.
She is director of the Museum of longevity, about one in the world.
This is documented life almost eight dozen Talyšů from the neighborhood who are elderly hundred years. Fatullayev shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years have fathered a child.
Controversial star of this museum is a shepherd of sheep Sirály Müslümov, which was reportedly 168 years old.
A birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest man with the documents was 122 years old, it seems extremely doubtful Müslümovův age.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatullayev.
The man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136 is said to have fathered a daughter.
So misunderstood Sirály Müslümov at his age a few decades?
The aged people in Central Asia but i heard Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"Strikingly, many people old age living in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also lives in Sardinia extremely many very old men."
Due to a lack of supporting documents can not be submitted no scientific proof of age, especially when registers are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerika live the biblical age remarkably often.
Currently, there are 20 people who are more than 100 years.
Why not live here in the south so many aged people?
Azerbaijani Farid Mugimzadeh guide that explains the specific genes Talyšů.
Museum Director Fatuljeva contrary, they believe that it is in nutrition.
But that just calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and dairy products in particular, and many of them daily drink a glass of melted butter is so healthy, in terms of bromatologického just does not seem plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In 97 years at this latitude still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which claims to have 143 descendants live in simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Caucasian region.
Sitting on the ground with churn, which relentlessly rocking.
Under one roof here live eight people, including one of his sons and daughter Mirzajevy. Both have long grandparents.
Bounce around and two small children.
In the kitchen, you can enjoy tea, which is served in typical břichatých glass "army".
White teeth Mirzajevy form a perfect line and a scarf hiding under a long dark blond braids that lie ahead proudly reveals her son.
I always washing her hair with milk, so I looked and retain color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
Monthly pension for life just
She ate only what came out of her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In all my life I have never once bought groceries at the supermarket.
Then he tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But everything is better when oar assumed "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda is a strange old woman mouth.
However, the cult that makes peoples around the father, who ruled his country as a dictator in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
Was in power until 2003, then took the oar of his son Ilham.
Elderly people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer hardship.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the sum of the local situation from which we can well make ends meet.
And maybe he's right and long gray-haired son Mirzajevy : "Old people enjoy in our culture in high esteem."
They live in a large family, are loved, tended, and they are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
Returned to Cairo revolution.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep ambivalence country.
Closely discussion on the future constitution based on Sharia law.
Egyptian President highly pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And for that, we can do that, I am responsible before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, but especially Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular parties.
All of them, not in quarreling hopelessly disorganized opposition, because they are afraid.
Fear of ' God ' on the Nile at the mercy powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi said almost apologetically, that temporarily limited the competence of the Constitutional Court and the expanded her to "save the revolution."
But what he wants 61letý engineer who has a doctorate American University in Southern California, truly saved, as do the Egyptians or the world out.
To be deprived of judicial power?
234 paragraphs that stohlavé Constituent Assembly dominated Islamist hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, partly arouse concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is said in the proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and may fear that Islamists this vague wording and its related legal clearance to use stricter interpretation of sharia.
At least it explains the newly added section : In all matters relating to Shariah, it is necessary to consult with the University of al - Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
Not necessarily, but it may mean that the clergy will supervise the legislation, which would bring justice de facto withdrawal of incapacitation.
The draft constitution is much a matter of interpretation
The problem also is that it should continue to maintain the civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These trials served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody up to 11,000 civilians.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect the "true nature of the Egyptian family and support her morals and values."
It is legally worded so imprecisely that use this section to state institutions actually control the content of film art and literature.
In clear language it means nothing more than censorship.
Moreover, no writing section does not define an explicit equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits defame or slander the Prophet Muhammad and his emissaries.
Remains uncertain, what is defamation and how will be prosecuted.
Acts as flawed wording that prohibited "hurting people."
Just in case the president has cartoon or joke to the account of knowledge of the law?
Matter of interpretation, as many others in this proposal that Mursi submitted for signature and says he will "very soon" present Egyptians to the popular vote.
"Revolution is back"
For several weeks, the opposition formed against the odds Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people in unusual harmony gathered Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the constitutional charter, before it starts to pay.
"The revolution is back and we win," said Hamdín Sabbah, who is the presidential election ended in third place.
Nobel laureate and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft Constitution includes "the dustbin of history."
Via short message service Twitter followers accused Mursího they want to make a "coup against democracy".
"If a referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said a member of the opposition Yasser Said.
"I'm not tired, the blood of our brothers has not been punished," media quoted Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several judges indicated that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Well-organized Muslim Brotherhood announced vzdorodemonstraci of caution, however, not in Tahrir Square but the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and supporters Salafists who shouted: "The people calls for the application of God's law."
They called Mursího : "Cleanse the earth!" and assured : "The Koran is our constitution."
The battle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, probably caused by a status similar to civil war.
It Mursího adherents quite obviously did not want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents and proponents of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box to decide which direction the country is going.
For some it is considered to be most in favor of the Islamists.
"The word ' human rights ' does not occur even once"
Forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa'd.
Forty-eight human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were under Mubarak in prison or stood before the court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because of his human rights are indivisible.
For that he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"A new constitution now are not the words ' human rights' even once," he complains in an interview for the "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursího extend power to all three components of power in the state of lawyer forced to resign.
These measures are scandalous affront to the democratic rules of the game and lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead, the president strengthened civil society, in fact threw it out," lamented Sa'd.
However, without civil society democracy can not function.
Sa'd feel abandoned by the international community, which pursues match ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and suspense.
It would, he could backfire.
Protesters at Tahrir Square, warns : "You made a monster that can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk : Most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
It could be the secret to the success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheese.
Place the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football kits.
Let this week be.
So get paralyzing sense of smell odor rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, gorgeous views - and hangs in the air pervasive odor.
Rakfisk is salty fermented trout in the water for up to a year - depending on how much you want to fish stank.
How is dark and getting cold, start the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, nejpodmanivějšímu eat.
"You dream it raw and then it swallowed a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional firefighter, but also so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival.
All around us people eat small fish cubes and washed down with plenty of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink may trump odor.
Several pieces try.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, which was a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time when Norway was in poverty, and because there were no refrigerator, fish in the fall dipped in airtight barrels with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and ate - no doubt senses dulled by alcohol.
Before one generation thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, the majority emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by the large amount of work, high earnings and comprehensive system of care.
Swedes, the old rival, which was not long ago much richer than Norway, pouring into the country for work.
On rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, although quite smelly part of Norwegian history.
Among expensive food market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost £ 9 ($ 14) per piece.
Norway to global reports often do not - and it seems that most of the population it that way.
Name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremists who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still refer grudgingly.
Instead of shooting is called "event from July 22."
Norwegians can hardly believe in the peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
In the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's oil and gas industry from the early 70th of the twentieth century.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says feeding plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and blue eyes is surprisingly prototype Nordic welfare.
We, as in you says, sensible people.
Her English, like most English people here, it is absolutely perfect.
Nepředvádíme, I do not like ostentation.
Norway handle its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of the majority of the money invested in the special fund earmarked for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial collapse threw the money they had, the Norwegians had in their purse strings tight.
"Until we can ski in winter and summer go on trips, we are happy," says Anna.
"A rakfisk eat," he adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in front of something to eat - rakfisku I've had enough.
Such a moose burger is definitely something different and beautifully juicy.
But the evening is stinking fish here again.
Hotel, where I live, is one of the many places serving rakfisk to dinner where guests choose the best, or rather the smell most fish.
They have a connection with a live television broadcast, in which moderator is surrounded with butterfly plate with rakfiskem.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What you have to score the finest fish up there in the mountains, Thore - Juergen?"
"This is our scoring Havard."
Loud applause and laughter.
Man falls from a chair, maybe worn out aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a difficult start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges they face, and the mixed expectations of its citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers enclosing several key routes into the city and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim was not to prevent commuters in it to get to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto receives the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Facing a challenging task.
Mexico during the tenure of the outgoing Felipe Calderon did well economically, the country is in the grip of drug war, which have estimated victim took 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has towards the Mexican people a big commitment in reducing violence," the president said Pena Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
Suggest a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with U.S. President received President Pena Nieto political experience as governor of his home country Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader is different in his old homeland, a vast populous state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo remember him for good.
Citizens attributed to them by the development of tourism in the resort and build infrastructure.
Until now the city can be reached by one of the new highways that had Pena Nieto build. These highways are a huge improvement over leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
Plate with his name also hangs on the wall of a modern sports center and the stunning interactive museum on the theme of climate change.
"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state MEP President Pena Nieto, institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).
Particularly interesting in hope and real change in the security and economy that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 uninterrupted years in power, the party was pushed PRI Vicente Fox.
Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace Los Pinos in the party by Enrique Pena Nieto many expected.
A statement of opposition rejects characterizing the new president as a man without substantive content.
It's a very straightforward person, very impressed with the excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman, and especially the man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state this is not the impression that she has from her former governor of many people.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, can not be contrast with cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo obvious.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways recalls the very outskirts of Mexico City.
A problem in the municipality are also hardy and city.
Earlier this year, the army was called in to assist in managing drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly poignant is violence against women.
Only in the last two years, the desolate places next to a huge garbage dump littered bodies of dozens of murdered women.
While Pena Nieto was governor in the State of Mexico killed more than 1,000 women, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics Pena Nieto said that during his time in office has failed to adequately address the problems of murders of women.
And worse, his leadership accused of turning a blind eye.
In concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, I byIrinei Buendia shows pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppressing tears.
According to the official version of the Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, so it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Ms. Buendia.
They were there to mark the beats and rigor mortis had already begun.
As her mother tells the story of Mariana looks down at the picture on the wall, next to the cross, on which the single word "Justice".
However, this is, as the family exactly what they did not.
State authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, Worrier and kňouralka.
They want you to just accept what they say and silent.
"But it can not be right, when there was so many errors and omissions," he says.
Sherpa, the president Pena Nieto received on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico hit by violent crime and the new president promised during his time in office will be his priority.
"I hope it will be the same president as he was governor," he says in Valle del Bravo PRI deputy Olvera.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fears most.
Bradley Manning complained about poor treatment, says a military prosecutor
Military prosecutor seeks to disprove the claim Bradley Manning regarding abuse in custody.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of ill-treatment of Manning in prison.
Soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
Military prosecutor trying to prove that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of secret material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse she allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor maj. Ashdene Fein during cross-examination of Private Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maeda in Maryland claimed that records of weekly visits that Manning had with officers of the units during the nine months detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no allegations of ill- treatment.
Cross-examination, which took place during the hearing conducted on motion by the defense dismissed the case against Manning because of abuse during detention, which is in itself sufficient punishment took place a day after Manning testified that in connection with contemplated suicide.
Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during their service in Iraq.
The material was then published on- line on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of their information.
At Friday's hearing through military prosecutor Fein along with Manning forms that officers filled after meeting with Manning in prison at Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011 held in high-security regime.
Officers Manning asked questions and recorded his answers.
When he Fein on Friday on these forms asked Manning admitted that his treatment by the guards rated as "excellent" and the overall treatment equipment rated as "very professional".
The forms do not reveal any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers Manning directly asked about it, how it is treated, said Fein.
Manning said that concerns about various issues expressed orally and that the officers who visited him, with him talking about these concerns and indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, not observed.
"Wrote" no problems "(after discuss concerns), and it may not necessarily mean that I did not mention about them," said Manning.
Judge Col.. Denise Lind Manning also asked why the treatment of his person complained in January 2011 during a meeting with the board of assessing suicidal thoughts, a few months previously expressed in the form.
Manning said that during this meeting was his intention to reduce the "prevention of injury".
The army said that for him this restrictive regime (one level below the supervisory arrangements due to suicide) used for the protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody knew that I was fine and that I wanted to cancel this mode to prevent injuries... so I could enjoy improved quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transported to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before it was transported to the detention center at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait and once there he fainted because of the heat.
He said that that he was not allowed to know what it is and what is happening in the outside world, it was very depressing.
"My world has shrunk only to the base Arifdžán to the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was in the cage die.
Manning said after arriving in Quantico spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, blanket, sandals, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk, because sleeping or just lying in the day was against the rules.
Manning said that he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in the eye.
He said that if the guards can not see his face, when the night turned to the other side, woke him and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint handling with Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred in April 2011 to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the allegations raised in Thursday's testimony regarding the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates in the morning counting.
Manning testified that counting was not able to hide his blanket.
During Friday's hearing conducted Judge Manning said that the orders of their guardians decided that the blankets that could cover up, postpone, but admitted that he ordered her to postpone one has gone before.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was last night forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that it is not dangerous.
Manning said the officer said he could use the belt of his underwear or his sandals to get hurt, but he did not.
Manning testified that the night was out of his cell, removed his underwear, his sandals and sunglasses.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his incarceration, and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to start early next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it planned that Manning admits to blame in lower crime and to fight against the other charges because they are too extreme.
Start hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor to defend his conditions of detention as justified.
Pentagon statement said that Manning was held in accordance with the regulations relating to all detainees held in custody with maximum security.
Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, causing unlawful disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmitting information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If the accused on all counts, may be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis Mexican- American identity
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
During his last trip to Mexico City, I barely got through the crowd and I into the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.
Arrows pointing to one of two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and I did not know where to go.
I grew up in central California and all my life I've been called "Mexican".
It is ethnicity abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York called themselves "Italy".
So after I finished the designation "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the homeland of my grandpa was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
But I have no vocabulary native speaker and I can not get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in the queue for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment this week, newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House President Obama.
The program had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet : immigration, drug trafficking and trafficking.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why the same probability that Mexicans stay in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
A Pena Nieto has vowed to continue the war against the Mexican drug cartels, though did not give any details.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under threat of arms rewrite half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the U.S. official says something just a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans intervene in the sovereignty of its neighbor.
A children Montezuma steps out on the warpath.
And yet, for the most Mexico real challenge related to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
Those a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers opportunities, and others who do not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point our family tree a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent who was in Mexico denied the opportunity and had to go to the north.
And more often than would seem to fit the profile of the person - dark skin, poor education, poor villages of origin, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
Is the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and view us as an inferior race that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never enough.
Our existence is their opinion only on failure.
If our families in Mexico did not fail, he would have never left him.
And we found none now trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that among Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is tension because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resent.
Although it is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.
And while many Mexican Americans that I know do not feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but the roots do not have even one.
In Mexico looks to us as Americans.
And in the United States are considered Mexicans.
And that relationship even more complicated, they want some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned during my trip, reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans working for Mexico as a "makeshift ambassadors" and represented the interests of the United Mexican States.
We say to our fellow Americans, how wonderful it is to visit this country, and to put pressure on political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.
No.
It is therefore happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are certain that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how to act with Mexico before one and a half centuries, and must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feels resentment for the way it dealt with their family members in the past much more.
Hmmm.
We may have more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
End -fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such happening is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, it changed many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. A first rocket from Gaza landed in the vicinity of Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although it seems that Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict around them changing Middle East.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it will cause their fight will be even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that it may break the deadly stalemate.
A war that neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that at present there is not much reason for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire closed on 21 November last, the fight this week strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which rules the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite killing several Hamas leaders and closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most pitiful and most populated parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently managed by his staunch rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.
In addition, Hamas leaders very well assume that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, so that Hamas won the rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, resurrecting a regional power that was once the closest Muslim ally Israel, were added to the side of Hamas. Likewise, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas said that the Islamic crescent encircling around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the government party / militia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern flank of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous Arab country and the flagship, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled in Egypt 30 years until his fall in 2011, Hamas had no time.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion.
In future diplomacy with Hamas may appear as a player who can not be expelled or Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners come to opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system proved its worth and many rockets Hamas has been destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In the diplomatic terminology America as unflinching as ever. Many European countries also accused Hamas of starting the final round of violence.
And most importantly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, was relatively calm on Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which extends into the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protecting Jewish settlements, which is still growing despite its illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections held on the 22nd January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, it would neodpalovali missiles, as did their countrymen in Gaza?
It will be better if we keep behind the walls and smack them when they poke heads.
Maybe hardliners win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, have little love for Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israeli defense expenditures are higher than the costs of its four Arab neighbors together.
Start a new war with the local superpower hardly help new Arab governments recover its economy.
The fact that President Mursi collaborated with President Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire is a good sign and may be the start of something new.
Also, Israel would in the circumstances have to look in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination powder keg, which has one of the areas occupied by Israel explode - like a bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Already currently repression weaken the Jewish state and democracy demographics makes this worse, as the Arab population is growing.
Bloody attacks on Gaza to be held every few years to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic duty.
Both parties need incentives from the outside.
The answer is that what you preach reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states, Israel ever cede the area for safety reasons.
In the short term there is little hope that the ceasefire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little more influence to promote this stuff.
Egypt, which along with Turkey and Qatar must commit to stopping the supply of weapons into Gaza, is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on 1967 borders with replacing parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside must also push for agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would create a Palestinian state made more than immediate offer virtual statehood at the UN.
President Obama also has its part to how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term neglected the performance of its own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House seems to be equally reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, Act of nasty cigarette packs
On the ugly green boxes that are the same for all brands of tobacco, as illustrated warnings for smokers and the sick part of the body.
Come into force Australian laws ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and logos and brands with a generalized color olive green boxes with hideous pictures of the patients body parts and displaying the children and the sick newborns of smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images are compulsorily from Saturday only difference between boxes brand names that are printed in the same small size.
This is the highest mode in the world concerning the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by the vice rid of his appeal.
It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking at the age of 26 years, 99% chance it will never begin to smoke.
"Even very young children can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies try them together to sell their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and cites studies, for example, showed that children associate crown in the logo with the idea of to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry against the introduction of these laws lobbied hard.
Tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"With this legislation, there are serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will bring more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Other claims that the laws increased their trade.
Sandra Ha from the company Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging of silicon used to cover the disgusting boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal to the laws of the Australian High Court, has increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company Zico has sold nearly 6,000 pieces of wholesalers and expects new supplies.
It gives us a good deal.
As a possible snag experts say the popularity of social media among the demographic groups to which the plan addresses.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that most vendors cigarettes hidden from direct view, the tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but can not restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and left you only this small space to promote your products is your online space compelling place in which to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman has seen an increase from brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out the "average Honza".
We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who truly loves Marlboro cigarettes and put the work and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has looked at what to do with the new regulations, than on marketing.
Industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - the country of the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that no country in Australia significantly traded.
Plotting SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek said the government had held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to packaging.
Canada was the first country, which in 2001 introduced mandatory warning picture.
Now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
About stricter laws considering Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resists.
Pictures of me have no effect.
Just ignore them.
"Just pull out a cigarette and shove the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying boxes with pictures of tumors in the mouth.
Frankly, it's just one more reason to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns a newsagent King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, said that due to uniform enclosures for him is even harder on the shelves.
"Unloading took me an hour, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government would just be a complete ban then we said, ' OK, this is the end, close the shop,'" he said, throwing up his hands.
In a world of continuous connectivity is not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of additional aircraft.
So we had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I will not lie.
Wait half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty- free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come to get bored with praise.
They say that for us (and our children) is a good idea to occasionally get bored.
It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And given that most of us nowadays is constantly connected to any screen, we have a chance to enjoy boredom.
We therefore support the boredom?
Year
Zatím nejsme schopni provádět překlad z jazyka „havajština“ do jazyka „angličtina“.
But to come back.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom : A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the boring long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was a Latin inscription found on boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and presentation of ideas audience of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not capable of doing."
Boredom is different from the apathy that the person is not involved in anything, but I would be.
He says the apathy exists urge to do something.
He says that the core of boredom is a "disruption of attention, coupled with a bad mood and feeling of slowly passing time."
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the relationship may have bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, they see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that they are bored, when we only have difficulty concentrating.
In his study "The unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person reading an article from magazine.
Some groups have heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard so low that it barely noticed, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the silent television program, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties boredom.
When you are trying to concentrate on difficult or engaging task, disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study authors.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "such as finding bad components on the factory line, distracting music can help with that to keep you busy."
In fact, I now know that twisting and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, may actually help fight boredom and keep people physically attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to fidget, to learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
All of us have experienced boredom - delay of my flight, droning speaker, especially lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
For help with measuring boredom scientists in the 80th the last century developed a "scale for the propensity to get bored" (Boredom proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do, is repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have time to do them all.".
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in terms of the need for more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.
But he said that he knew that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people is not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question : "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, gamble or abusing addictive substances as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain does not always know the best thing you should do.
If you're bored and you use this energy to playing the guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch television, make you happy for a while, not a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you will not be bored, but learn how to self entertain or self drive, said Professor Fenske.
A "this self- control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will learn only how to entertain itself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I do not think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But nor should we respect it should not be too critical.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when you are away from the constant chattering and technology.
Profesor Eastwood souhlasil.
"We blame it on the need to bore you with more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
That's what people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly over-reactive," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain themselves when the noise stops."
In Colorado there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana
Nineteen year old Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for what will soon be the head of state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which he used on her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day went with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - minor offenses, which is fine for every 100 USD - and was given a date for trial.
"They treated us as criminals," said Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use answer depends hundreds of minor drug cases on the spot rather than on law.
Hundreds of cases of offenses for possession of marijuana has been here in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures were repealed.
Police Department stopped blaming adults aged 21 years and older for possession of small quantities, which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks in force.
But the plaintiff in conservative districts of Colorado declared that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.
At the same time several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains vote on preventing the opening of the new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
"This matter is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
You scratch their heads and regulators in the state of Washington.
And looking how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale - all in the first term December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use at first and now recreational.
"Colorado has regulated the market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council to grant licenses to sell alcohol Washington State.
But as Mr. Smith admitted no place or the system can not do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can manage," he said.
Washington law, the so-called I- 502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will be no state licensing system, but legal possession yes.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the state directive on "adequate access" to a licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in cannabis to 330 meters away from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"No one will be more difficult to place the licensed trade in cannabis than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan Seattle area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, recently established research group.
21st November sent Police Chief Oates of Aurora, its officers, e - mail, in which they announced that the city prosecutor will not prosecute offenses for possession of small amounts of marijuana for every citizen over 21 years and that the police "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado is the District Attorney Ken Buck stricter view.
After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
It is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, 119 people, although many of them face additional charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses that were crimes when they occurred," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated in places like rural district Mesa, where voters rejected marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest town of the district, already accusing adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, decision support, but also decided not to reverse any pending cases hold.
"I do not think I'm wasting my time continuing enforcement until the change," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and legal system will never be easy.
A mixed reaction across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
The District Attorney is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of laws relating to marijuana.
"They spent so much of his life prosecuting people that still can not really accept that it is legal," he said.
The first states that a small amount of marijuana as to build strength, Colorado and Washington are poised to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.
Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalized sales, also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government that he still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping to submit to the Department of Justice.
Despite several arrests sellers of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use it to get attention, leaving most of the federal government dealings with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to strike out the door to catch a small bag of the drug is likely to balk at allowing the state controlled trading recreational marijuana allowed by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on drug policy the Obama administration.
Several towns of Colorado expects to process federal authorities.
Even before election day some local governments approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, although it will take about a year before being able to open any shop.
Last week, the city of Montrose West State has proposed a six-month ban and it is likely that next week will enter into force.
"We do not want to find yourself in a situation where someone issues a license and then it will have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against the amendment.
I look at it, voted for the community, contrary to what the state has voted.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt : "I was forced to leave Oxford, since I am a conservative."
For his opinions are not attacked for today's university students.
I do not think I've ever dreamed about studying at Oxford University.
As my father and my older brother studied at university, which I thought is the largest global headquarters, ovíněné modern Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And while I'm at the end of the 80th twentieth century to two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my bags and I rushed to the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
Daily Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objections to the love of students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said mischievously, that I left because I was forced to drink from a chipped mug.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of enlightenment alleged it was as bigoted and barbaric, my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I'm a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You might ask why I pull it up now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right of center suffers from similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of students sought the protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College says that because of his political views are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and they made clear they were not welcome."
Calls for a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can freely communicate.
Their situation is not helped by recently launched BBC television documentary titled Two Wonderland : Young, Bright and on the Right (Fairyland : young, intelligent and right) of student politics that conservatives portrayed as weirdos and neo-Nazis.
The program was introduced graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Oxford University Conservative Association - OUCA), who drove a Rolls -Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a cane with a silver head.
On the other universities conservative students say about them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees treated as a "scapegoat."
Dvacetiletý Luke Black, viceprezident Nottingham University Conservative Association (konzervativní asociace Nottinghamské univerzity), řekl nedělním novinám, že "levicový vliv na univerzitách roste.
People think that we as a Bullingdon Club, without us ever met. "
Twenty-one student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says the climate is "uncomfortable", while nineteen elected president OUCA Cherill Stephanie says that members of the JCR access to the people the right of center deteriorated.
"This represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During his first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I boarded in September 1986, the 18 year old and crippling shy way.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.
The year before university voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree former student of Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in higher education funding.
From the atmosphere by the Stalinists and trembling fear.
During the first few days in the opening week when new students come together with each other and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which was to come.
I discovered that not only professors tacit approval prodding conservative students, but with a taste to it and participate.
In the wood-paneled auditorium was brought Policy miners' strike, the privatization of the government and opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the French text of the 18th century in English and what followed, I was not ready.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was doing pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like cake batter was very bilious.
"Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or just stupid?" he asked.
Other students giggling.
My eyes welling with tears.
"I suggest that you read in your spare time took some basic French lessons, unless you're too busy social issues, 'said Professor Pitt.
Dismayed, I returned to my room.
At dinner in the school, I was sitting alone when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is a target.
He for me is bad enough, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Most conservative freshmen pretending to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend to be a coward.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything you said Thatcher.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
First-year student in philosophy, politics and economics, which (ironically) went to Eton, said : "You are the daughter of fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students with him twittered.
I was sick, dirty.
"As conservatives love?" asked one.
Beating up each other, right?
I felt the way they have felt before homosexuals liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
I was forced to meet with like -minded people just after dark?
I'd have to change the Labour Party and suppress their natural inclinations?
Three years before me develop as purgatory ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who lived at my school.
He hated not only that it is conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher 's foreign policy, and one of those who write her speeches.
Almost there.
This place hated for its parochialism and pettiness and his tendency to Marxist- deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he said.
I started to commute from Oxford to his parents' house in London, seeking refuge in their metropolitan disinterested friends and family.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.
He could not believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the forties were accepted by all political views.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
It would not, not in a dreamy mood.
Even my Communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His moist eyes somber.
Try it.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you leave.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London with my emotional strength to deteriorate.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his belief.
The following week, in the course of teaching, the other a professor of history in complete seriousness said I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
While I was inside blushing with shame, I admitted that my "parents brainwashed" and I called them "old fools".
The relief was only temporary.
The nail in the coffin of my career Oxford drove my father.
At the time, wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's newspapers.
My door was locked.
I cringed inside, and after five minutes to my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me snotty weak.
But no 18 year old girl or boy should not be in an educational institution subject to such intimidation and toxicity.
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only came 14 Conservative Prime Minister, but also that to this day behind undeserved reputation as a place of equality and freedom of thought.

The hardest craft in the world : medium sulfur in Kawah Ijen volcano
In four of the euro gamble carrier in Indonesian volcanoes with their lives and health, while tolerated 70 pounds of sulfur down the steep stone paths.
They are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case Wijaya Anta, one of the 400 miners who make their living mining sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day go down the pit to the bottom of the crater, where sulphurous gases escaping from the interior of the Earth and in contact with the air passes into the solid state.
After chisel large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets steep stone paths.
The top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, is only 250 meters, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes to climb turtle pace up because they maintain balance and thoroughly counsels his steps, and collapsed to slip into the abyss.
They know that any misstep would happen life, as it happened a French turistce that years ago, fell from the rocks Kawah Ijen.
Miners at Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur, which are extracted
When you are at the top, making their way around the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and wearily away with heavy baskets to the weight which mining company ranked slightly lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi that the volcano has been extracted since 1960, and never paid his workers more than 662 Indonesian rupiah (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industries, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening sugar.
"Because I normally wear 70 pounds, I earn about 46,000 rupees (€ 3.8) per trip," says Anto us, which usually undergoes three trips a day.
One way he takes three hours and at the end is broken, but can earn as 138,000 rupees (€ 11.5) per day.
Although it seems negligible amount so inhuman effort is three times what would be made in the field.
"The daily wage of miners here is very high. Example for the collection of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (€ 1.2) per day and pay for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros)," said Carrier, who previously worked on the holiday island Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (€ 6.2) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, an important reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulfur: "Married I was a young girl from Bali which is Hindu, and I took it to Java, to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, bad breath for him, still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
In his 27 years Anto three times daily risks his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur on him already begun to take its toll, even though his face was protected by a mask and goggles.
He has asthma, bad breath for him, still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price we must pay for it to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two years, because I want to open a business or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.
This likeable and intelligent young man stricken by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead of doing the work carrier.
It shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers, and each day gets up at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur at night to keep the springs, and its characteristic yellow color changes in dark blue and September.
Despite the surrounding darkness Fara Anto into the crater and illuminates your way through a small lamp which is mounted on the helmet and myself to spend the money bought.
About 400 media brings baskets on their shoulders with the sulfur from the crater floor
Although the company has a high income, the extraction of sulfur due to cost savings nezmechanizovala or provide carriers operating on their own and with such zeal, no equipment.
Actually not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (€ 2.5) of the premium for the shooting, which along with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (€ 1.2) park wardens collected from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," he says Madrusin, hefty 42letý carrier that operates in Kawah Ijen past three decades, ever since he left school.
Handle to lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it keeps working, "as long as possible" because they need money for the education of their three sons aged between 18 and 10 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although sulfur burning throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and grasps miners in dense fumes that come from volcanoes, miners are being told that none of them complain that they suffer from serious illnesses... But it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on his shoulders due to the weight of baskets.
Unainik who balances his basket on his back, in their 53 years can load only 50 pounds.
Every day he and his colleagues vydolují in a volcano 15 tons of sulfur, which then three trucks to take home a steep path between bushes in warehouse Tamansari 18 km away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life," says Unainik and opens mouth while at large, which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons the eldest, thirty, also earns mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the continual misery of one of the toughest in the world of crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts, performing human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore raises babies to save the economy
Singaporeans seduce that do not have children, career, stress and cost of living and education.
"Population Singapore needs to grow."
I am married and I am a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. Fulfills his civic duty and beget new life!
It may seem incredible that this part of the advertising slogan peppermint candies, but nevertheless - or perhaps because of - the video earlier this year in Singapore massively expanded on YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rap that uses local cues like "let a bun in the oven" a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hoping that they succeed this ad to raise the issue humorous way.
Artistic Director of the Agency Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use music to influence people to meet "their civic duty."
" It is only a matter of the internet, so it must be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had a feeling that this is a topic which we have touched.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things like extend perfume with pheromones or organize familiarization parties.
Many of these ideas can indeed be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible, such as the composition of rap, to solve this problem. "
1.2 children
He who does not take it too lightly, the Singapore government.
Spent annually 1 300 USD to encourage people to have more children.
Government package to marriage and family provides up to$ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures had but little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology to Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last exceeded the birth rate is 2, which is considered as a measure of recovery in 1976.
Why Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Marriage and Family National Office for the population says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"So people have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it is not only marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and delaying marriage and childbearing. The result is a reduction in birth rate in Singapore.
While the immigration policy of the desire to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a precaution against a decline in population among the locals it caused resentment.
On some Singaporean website is seen undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year saw Singapore's ruling party, its worst election result since independence early.
After the elections, some efforts to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health and immigration policies, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to not build many small houses.
For example, began to influence the real estate business.
Office for Urban Development began to regulate the number of small dwellings known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 meters square and had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support the bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of development company EL Developers claim that their "shoebox" are selling much faster than larger homes.
"They are popular, so that will be sold within days to weeks faster than homes with larger areas.
Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "
However admits that the new standards set clearer rules to developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a project.
too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim at increasing the birth rate of the nation, interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district of downtown suggests that they do not have a big effect.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, because so many people postponed," said a young officer.
"Other whether they have children.
But for me it is important to rely on their own time and money, " says another, twenty-something, young man.
Men and women mention career, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whether the government is trying to force any citizen to have kids, they are equally eventually Singaporeans who are starting a family on the last word.
What is private is private offline and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy is something that is personal in nature or the "area of private life, he has every right to protect against any disturbance."
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16 years?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and social networks?
It is understood the danger which is exposed when the Internet exposes issues that would surely anyone say when normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases considered the notion of privacy as "something entirely his own" personal level and for "username and password" if it were a social network.
"My biggest secret would not disclose," says Jorge ten years in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secret, my mom might know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
" The FB give nice pictures or photos as you play.
Also there telling acquaintances.
I did not share a photo that was not mine, or a photo that someone would look ridiculous, " she says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, pictures of naked people or photographs crimes, or write demeaning or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends that has the FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are related.
Among them is the mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
" I created a Twitter account, so I can express their opinions and to write interesting posts.
I do not know if someone answers me there is only so I give, "he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can speak with relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Even if he did not care if someone recommended a stranger.
The case is José fourteen different.
The teenager 's own accounts on the networks Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and the last -mentioned network admits he does not know 20 people from your friends list.
"I'm not afraid of it, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to the boy, he was one of them for anything nenaváděl nor after did not address or telephone number.
"If me and urged me to require, simply remove from your account," he admits.
José volunteered to Ask after you read the recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
" Famous friends on the social network blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
Never did not find out who it was, "he confirms.
The victim, according to José logged out of your account.
"Just activate the private mode."
Then a series of steps explains how to safely set up an account.
Unlike Jorge would this boy has published photos of friends in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
"Sure I would, if someone bothered or should I just felt like it.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying, "he says.
key issues
Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and graduate of education and teaching, is that to children and adolescents in social networks properly oriented, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
It states that: "The Internet was created as a resource for finding information, but if there were social networking has changed the rules of the game."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, graduate education at Yale University and author of digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
" Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to learn, and yet still teach yourself, " she says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to disseminate, publish, and say, and what did not, in an age when it is not yet ripe."
Also to be - in terms of area - sober, when what he most wants is to be liked, to have thousands of friends and think about the consequences, " he adds.
According to this specialist is the most effective way for children and adolescents show that it is private, asking questions that make you think.
"Telling them not to do something that does not work," he adds.
Furthermore Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options : There are things that you would not tell a stranger, so why do it online?
Or: Would you like it if someone posted your picture as you published the friend's?
You know what others publish about you?
When označuješ people in the photos of the celebrations, these people ask you for permission?
And one more : Need to constantly everyone know what you're doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave on the Internet as well as outside of it.
These are the same rules.
"People outside the internet governed respect, ethics and other principles and the same should it be on social networks," he says.
surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is essential that parents carefully read the rules of social networks.
" If you understand the intricacies of every single have a good basis to make with the children talked about the consequences of opening an account on the Internet can have.
For example, in terms of age, or what is allowed to share or disclose, " he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "do not talk to strangers."

Rafael Correa : South America must learn from European integration
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of citizenship is the goal, in which "the South America, in this case really should learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth Presidential Summit of South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú, the Europeans "were killed in World War 2" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country."
In this sense, defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which Unasur member countries support the organization.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any Latin American country, which already takes place between members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that we want to return to the past," he said.
Ecuadorian President, inter alia, expressed its agreement with the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that it will reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who signed the Pact of San José on Human Rights.
"Those who are at the forefront, never to anything binding, and we all sign the South American vice versa.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, funded by the United States, "he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that this decision does not regret, because it betrayed its principles, and respect its "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, criticized the Swedish justice system which asked him to take on Swedish territory underwent questioning for alleged sexual misconduct with "own Swedish legislation allows to carry out interrogation videoconferencing calls that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that Assange gets worse physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken to him since he is on our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that a minor lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorian head of state.
" There is, however, that his physical and mental condition deteriorates because it is locked in a small space without exercise in the fresh air.
That would notice any health, "he added.
President Correa said that the solution provided asylum to Assange from June Ecuadorian Embassy in London under a license that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the London talks were held to resolve imprisonment WikiLeaks founder.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, such a word in this case we do not use, but always conducted interviews.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzon leads a series of management in different European instances "mentioned.
He said that "if the United Kingdom shall pass tomorrow, everything will end."
And if Sweden Mr. Assange hear the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it easily allows local legislation and how it was done in other cases, it will be tomorrow an end to this problem. "
Correa took advantage of this situation that presented itself as a defender of press freedom, and explained that definitely does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The biggest enemy of a free press we, vile and evil politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, " he said.
From this perspective, expressed joy over the fact that neither takovíto journalists, "nor bankers nor the hegemonic country and even the bourgeoisie are not proficient in Ecuador", and mentioned, that if re-elected, "will continue in the changes led the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa has also supported the decision to no longer maintain veto Paraguay expressed regarding EU membership Unasur at least until its next election and argued that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and Putchism cloaked in legality" because in fact "destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Ecuadorian president also alleged that considers it "entirely appropriate" to the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries at this time of the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
There is not a judgment accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.
It is necessary to consider at large to overcome and was able to go forward. "
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the dispute over maritime boundaries, which addresses the same court Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is proper for Latin America seek international instance, if both countries commit themselves to accept the judgment will be any hard."
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador to bid in the order is the third mandate, noted that sees this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if the February 2013 election loses, retires from public life.
"Personally, I never cared much, but so unfair situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, may be correct only political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guarantees this unlikely victory, and therefore we must accept this responsibility, " he said.
" If I win, it would be my last presidential term, and then I retired from politics.
When we lose, I expect the same.
I've decided, " he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
" I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez went on a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the health status of the President, "he explained.
Head of the Ecuadorian State to attend the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the result of the test: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning struck me," says the memories of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "slightly reduced", but apparently without success.
The boy had concealed it from her family.
He decided to take his illness itself on its shoulders and began to inform her. And it so hard that she celebrated 43 birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most ancient Units HIV patients in the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came in 1994 after a battle with illness.
Fabrizio living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 22 years, which was unimaginable at the beginning of the 90th years when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time with him or clinic director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) bye, "because he had a cut."
Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible with this syndrome survive and live fully.
However, a lot of people who know about their disease and come up when the virus caused havoc vysílil body and immune system, and then become victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years since he appeared in the world of AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases "a great success that the length of life of patients who timely and appropriate treatment begins, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head Units HIV in Civil Hospital of Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
And infection control specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but the length of survival and full of life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients the disease is diagnosed, the better are the that those who do not use drugs : those with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and those with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
This simply means that the person who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, can these findings "in adherence to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained in an interview with a doctor.
To emphasize this progress is worth noting that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although the mortality rate in recent years has significantly decreased in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Yearbook of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS were killed by national statistics, 60 percent of patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year so far 187 However, since 2005 it has provided universal access to antiretroviral therapy.
- Why do people continue to die as a result of illness?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
That's how I see it, this is happening in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we have not run out of drugs. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the status of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease. "
Adds a conclusive statement: "Nine out of ten patients comes when it affects some infections. All you need to do, we can more affect overall mortality, the disease is diagnosed earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer large-scale testing for the disease all persons who request them."
In its proposal is consistent with specialists and officials from the National Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who have come to do tests to private labs just because it made his friend, despite her young age at his already erupted AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, cancer, which is one of the common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they die, and they do not want to know anything else.
"If I have to die, you'd better be discarded three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, it healthily, I exercise, I take drugs. "
To this day, his parents knew only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, tours, I lead an active sex life, but seriously, I pay attention to yourself and the other person, "cites Fabrizio, who accepted an invitation to share his experience with the daily Milenio JALISCO, so that today the World Day AIDS has motivated her witness those who are afraid.
"Let them leave to do the testing. Risked If so let them know as soon as possible if you are HIV positive, it's better. And if you have been diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, if they are responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms for Pulte
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a large gap, said Ricardo Salazar, the Guadalajara journalist who discovers information about the HIV virus.
A major gap in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task "actually increased distribution of condoms, used to give us one or two, now give us even a hundred packages of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among nejnáchylnějšími to new infections are teens.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and assessment by social workers, school counselors, employees, pharmacies and health professionals that teens want to avoid, says a reporter.
He suggested that inefficient allocation change. Whether condoms are not just for consoles, but the hundred and whatever is in dispensers in public restrooms, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
Nor is it about them "pay beer and motel" as governor Emilio González responded to the question whether he would agree with the distribution of condoms in her district.
Takovásexualita not. The best is to make condoms to those who have sex life lead, " he said.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
It was recorded 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
The situation in Mexico is fourth in a new diagnosed cases of AIDS and 13 in the context of HIV.
92% of infections is sexual contact, blood contamination 6% 2% y perinatally.
It is estimated that the HIV virus can live for about 50,000 people as the one registered case is four to five people who do not know about the disease.
Judgment of the Court of Appeal approved the United States, which does not recognize the debt restructuring of Grupo Vitro bankruptcy set in Mexico, raises an unfortunate precedent for any national company with offices in the neighboring country and the problem of solvency.
It seems, therefore, that the processes of restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws in the country lanes and stars despite international agreements apply.
Approval of the judgment delivered by the 15th June last year, Judge Harlin Hale the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern Texas leaving the practice of Mexican companies without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property across the river from El Bravo.
However, the judgment opening main Mexican manufacturers of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States with reference to three irregularities.
It must be said that while the judge of this case argue that the lenders have to manage the insolvency law of the United States Court of Appeals Fifth District, based in New Orleans says that the main procedure provides bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it showed the lack of knowledge of the process of international cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose a model law created the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which determines the arbiter of the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment states that without a vote branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognized by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, would not achieve the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility Mexican law permits.
The fact is that the case was not the first company Vitro, which was adopted this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for the internal debt underwritten by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes branches by lenders - who stood against Vitro court in the United States, ie funds "vultures" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - reached majority.
The vote would have reached about 45 percent ku 37
This figure Court of Appeal does not take into account.
From another perspective, accuses the tribunal of the wind out of difficult situations faced since 2008 - on the background of severe economic crisis that hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family business González Sets lodges an appeal for reconsideration directly to the appellate court that the assessment was carried out with the full participation, ie participation of five judges, as originally voted only three.
If he fails here, it will require a revision of the appeal process more instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
On the case is serious that the court failed to document sent by the Mexican government as a department amicus curiae, which is described in depth in Vitro of the Bankruptcy Act and which points out that the company facilitated by adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to confront the law with Part 15 of the Insolvency Act of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country is subordinate principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, that is, the rules defined for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: the punishment for Vitra and the state.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes : "Basketball was my life"
Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was with this sport mainframes connected more than 60 years and traveled with him around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories for local basketball history, as has Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before him in 2008 caught the stroke on the wheelchair, passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, both as a player younger categories, player in the National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach Vaqueros de Bayamón in the National Basketball League, and President of the Puerto Rico basketball Federation.
"I Held during his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time as when I was 90 years president of the National League BSN, director general of the national team and the President of the Federation," recalled Reyes reporters during a visit to the newspaper Primera Hora at home in Bayamon, where he lived for more than 50 years, with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes in his assertion exaggerating.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs of his long career, to testify.
Zatím nejsme schopni provádět překlad z jazyka „hauština“ do jazyka „angličtina“.
With the greatest emotion of all the guards, which are reminiscent of his work in los Vaqueros since the mid- 50th years, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time celebrated 15 years as co-owner and team owner.
" It was the best summer that I enjoyed the most, because I had the chance to los Vaqueros team since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or trainer.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the period from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when he made his debut in the BSN Jerome coins.
Then the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, "said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was formerly a coach at that time was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said :" I have a grown -foot player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players, Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow me then recommended Gausseho point guard Raymond, who joined the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember being told that if Minco will Bayamon win the championship, Gauss and contributing to the next. "
The championship, which the team los Vaqueros played Gauss, enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988, has served as President of Basketball Federation.
At that time he wanted to devote his full functionality and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in Olympic qualifying match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up fourth, but we have bronze but for the Canadian judge, who let us repeat the final face-off, " said Reyes.
Is the team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you have ever seen?
It is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we vypráskali team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which we blew a bronze medal at the World Championships.
This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopez "Piculin" (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) "Tonita" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales that could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that might not be perfect composition, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, it was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster, as were "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner who replaced the player is sent off for a skirmish in the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions we won gold.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculin Ortiz.
The number of international tournaments are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico reached at this level such results as Piculin.
Not to mention his work in various leagues, where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
From the very young to me like Leo Arilla work.
That his success in the Federation is the biggest?
That I was part of the era 's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995 and the beginning of the 90th year 's National League BSN in a single season to 17 teams.
What you missed the show?
There were things I wanted to introduce a youth division categories by region.
For example, that boys from Ponce played only in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play games too, which is not necessary.
Also see the benefits of mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, referees and assistant referees.
I am pleased to do so.
What we are now engaged?
Most listen to music, watch videos on YouTube with the music of my time, enjoying grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Begins a course that examines the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore topics such apocalyptic nuclear war, zombie, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When a religion professor Stuart Charo decided to do a course this semester on the end of the world, knowing that it is an irresistible temptation : the end of "long count" Mayan calendar that has come on the 21st December is caught by many people as proof that the end of the world comes.
Charo but had no idea what it in the next few months waiting : Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, budget gap, which some call the "debt Armageddon" and the growing conflict in which Israel is retracted, the place where Christians by theorizes about the end of the world apocalypse begins.
"I did not realize that this will nejapokalyptičtější semester ever was," Charo said this week the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When one analyzes what is happening in the world, as if we remained 30 days, it's a really good time.
And remember, a bad sign for the apocalyptic -minded good.
And that's not the only professor who offers courses on "End of the World" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University organizes an assistant professor Barry Vacker rate "means, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore topics such apocalyptic nuclear war, zombie, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas to extend the time," he says, and both offer a hypothetical scenario that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
The main campus of Pennsylvania State University got together Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and Amara Solariová his colleague, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, to organize a course to simply titled End of the World.
"Not connecting" 2012 "as always foresee the possibility to organize a course again if the world does not end," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom" students must study, develop projects and do the final exam.
At Penn State will be the final exam held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give students choice but to work "until the evening just supposed end of the world," said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He spread out in two hours," said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which enrolled 35
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received an e -mail asking them if there is space.
Students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to ourselves comforting," she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23 years Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And so apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs is only a matter of comfort or her absence.
Will Wekesa, 25 year old student of psychology and nursing, said he saw all apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of the hour in which it could teach," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no student confessed, let alone a professor, said he believes the end of the 21 date December.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan predictions and somehow disproves it," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá final year student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But it added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back a few centuries back, that people respond to changes in their environment predictions about the end of the world.
The flowering of speculation caused the internet.
"Elsewhere people think," he said.
This happens in the vast majority of the English- speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, the question of whether there knows of a course on "end of the world," he said quickly.
"The Philippines is the end of the world to participate," he wrote, suggesting an exception for the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall said that over the years there was talk of many days of the last judgment, and said that if nothing happens on the 21st December, "people immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophize that the 21st December is the beginning of a seven-year period expires at the end of the world.
Date taken lightly students and professors.
Several of them said they intend to go to the festival "end of the world."
"I guess I'll call a few friends, we laughed together," said twenty- student communication Samira Ford.
