What should it do so, the čssd? In Prague, the Czech Social Democrats have not voldemort, nor the "konditorei."
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously have to overcome some barriers, for your alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung can understand at all.
Members of the new Council from the čssd time the newspaper aktuálně.cz has a little "abgeklopft ', as it will dominate the notorious slang, which in the past few years has established, in which the current coalition partner in Prague were at the helm.
The codierte wortschatz, which in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, is some of the most famous players, situations and causae entlehnt.
Surprisingly showed that the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark.
They say it at least.
"Who is voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more of a neuling in the Prague policy," lukáš responded kaucký, the new ratsherr for culture, to the test of the "paten-wortschatzes."
But also the ratsherr Karel březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, to the concept of "golfloch."
"This is the only term of which I present here that I use now and then."
"Otherwise, I really don't think much of slang."
From the wortschatz, the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in June before the wahlkongress the ODS had published this year, pickte the redaktion six terms of it, especially those that are notoriously linked with the Prague magistrat.
The Social Democrats, the concepts of "voldemort," "the greatest possible Prague golfloch '," in the konditorei go, "" stiernacken, "" betrayal of the capital "and" verblechen "define.
Three Prague ratsherren agreed with the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague schulwesens - promised his first participation in the conversation, then took the time the hörer but not on it.
The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"These things are I DO NOT CARE, and how the Civic Democrats I do not talk to each other about rulings."
"What is important to me, as we understand us within the framework of our programmes," he countered.
As lukáš indicated that have been kaucký in the abovementioned headline appears not to recognize that from the influential businessmen and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek is said.
The term "voldemort" kaucky says nothing, and the only term, he was at the test erriet correct, "the most Prague golfloch."
"This is the blanka tunnel," says kaucký, on security but still added: "But I know that more in the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will have to have a sprachkurs Show."
The "golfloch" will not only by matador Karel březina, but also by the ratsherrn on the environment lukáš plachý appropriate as a tunnel blanka entziffert.
Both Social Democrats know, however, for whom the term voldemort stands for and lukáš even plachý knows, where this figure, and this is also to find what it is," in the konditorei to go."
"I believe, that is to say, in any way to go," the plachý Prague gastronomiebetrieb quite close to the rätsels solution, if you know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms.
According to březina but claimed it, this knowledge to have as a result of the newspaper, rather than that he would be wortschatz own.
The testteilnehmern suggest that, it seems under the Social Democrats in fact no similar to eingebürgerten to give slang.
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is such a thing for us really."
"We also call upon us with the name, from time to time we have to use words or spitznamen," says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský, from his parteigenossen casual called "hulda."
'in the school, I was bříza - birke - mentioned, but I do not know whether to call my colleagues that," tells us Karel březina his spitznamen.
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has the name tried and see there, and it works.
Ratsherr weinert is for the parteigenossen kind of "opa or less kind of the" old," "The representative Mirek poche before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring is pointed out, will be called 'igráček' - known Czech lego-figur - by some Members.
Spitznamen are so the only one that allow the Social Democrats in the whose language.
Hulínský said not like it when they call them "hulda," but deník aktuálně.cz registered had a different spitznamen the Prague chairman.
His gummiknüppel-rechte spitzname "Dr" has claimed to do with that Petr hulínský his title of doctor Juris to the bratislaver Police College has acquired.
The government wants to put an end to the torture of "hexen" and gave out a leaflet
Women, who are labelled hexen in Burkina Faso, are usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to the older generation, they are not work - for example, for health reasons, they are ledig and have no children.
If any of these women to hexe 'will," it will strictly isolated so that they can be the rest of the village is not dangerous.
"Men are affected by this fate fairly rare."
"young and healthy women remains spared this, as you join in the work and bear children," a ordensschwester describes the situation, which, in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso in a spezialheim takes care of more than a hundred women, which were rejected by their communities.
The ortsregierung decided now to act against these abnormal "sozialmaßnahme."
And, for this reason issued a leaflet, which is to put an end to the "hexenverfolgung."
But the matter has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,," the newspaper "derstandard" to the dilemma of the written information out.
But also in other African countries is to be accused of hexerei commonplace.
In Ghana, the neighbour of Burkina Faso, the 27-jährige ammy hemmahová tortured to death of three women and two men, it übergossen with petroleum and burned it simply to them.
Including the server BBC reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter would be only a meeting have been unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version is oil inflamed, the ritual salbungen will be used.
And, after the group have tried to "an evil spirit" from the woman's good health. "
The isolation of "hexen" Support the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted an 42-jährigen entrepreneurs from Burkina Faso here today, "fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least try to tone down the witch hunt, President of gambianische has in the last year the President himself to mitgemischt properly.
"President yahya jammeh triggered after the death of his aunt had a monstrous witch hunt, as it allegedly share of their death and now were also to kill the president even by black magic."
"To this end, he called schamane from the middle to the aid of Guinea, which accompanied by police officers, soldiers, and the President's leibgarde indiscriminately festgenommene women and men abducted from gambianischen villages by force and to the President's farm in kanilai did," led the organization Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the eingekerkerten people were forced to drink a absud from plants with halluzinogener effect, but also darm- and which caused nierenprobleme.
Two of the arretierten people survived the residence on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners have been released.
A tenant of bakala: he pays fuels in a foot - still higher miete
An older untersetzter man leaves that klientenzentrum of the society rpg byty of "kohlebarons" zdeněk bakala, the largest privatbesitzers of mietwohnungen in the Czech Republic.
A mappe under the poor with three new mietverträgen to three homes: for its own and the homes of his daughters and his son, which is a sentence.
All three were within the framework of the sog. "deregulation," especially the miete increases.
Instead of 3 500 kronor monatsmiete, the son in the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with Kitchen in the second category 4100 kronor berappen.
"And there is not time fluid to hot water and heating in the flat in a simple, we must kohleofen," for he pointed the finger at the new mietvertrag angry of the Son, he has the authority to his signature.
"But what I - signed property," he says half annoys and half resignedly.
's citizens' association bytyokd.cz, which the new mietbedingungen described as "by and immoral," advises the mietern, simply refuse to sign the new contracts and to wait until the December 7, in which it intends to publish a guidance as to how to take action against such contracts.
But the man to win only.
"One says this, the other is," makes it a finsteres face.
The region ostrava will go to the great "deregulierungslabor."
According to neujahr, this deregulation the most mietwohnungen in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants have not marktgerechte miete figures.
Aktuálně.cz, therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region ostrava and nine a.m. on this Tuesday brechend full.
In addition to the door, the bodyguards a sicherheitsagentur equally with her and a aufrufgerät.
"miete 2011," This is a special tastfeld on the touchscreen.
Shortly angetippt and already been nummernzettel from spuckt the machine.
Little we have the number "157" entziffert and even piepst it on the big display to the ceiling of the warteraums.
Half a second later, it is in the hot seat.
A little later enters an older married couple to the warteraum, after the miete questions, but it did not run in the warteraum, of the new miete.
Most of the people are here to the usual problems to be resolved, reparaturanträge, versicherungsangelegenheiten and so on.
From the middle of November flattern in the region ostrava kuverts with the new mietverträgen most of the mietern out of a total 44.000 homes to the portfolio of the rpg in the post boxes.
The rpg byty them in the letter proposes a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38 percent.
The Special counters for the new rent in the klientenzentrum is opened since 18 November.
"The action is something more than a week, that is, this is just the beginning," answers the ladies after a time delay, behind the counter at as the "client" emerging as a journalist.
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker he obtained from ostrava lubomír zaorálek taken up by the čssd quite loudly this matter, it is no wonder that the newspapers are full of this today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even ne besch. wc-brille they could auswechseln ', makes man air mentioned at the beginning.
Until now, according to the Working especially pensioners of the switch to, in order to convince, whether it is really the promised mietermäßigung that they have rpg promises, if they spezialangebot sign on time.
In half of the benefit of a reduced februarmiete must be the other tenants who are the new mietvertrag sign until 15 December.
Until now," deregulierungsschalter "in havířov but everything else, when overloaded of queries.
"From the yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the miete because of this," very appreciative of the schalterbeamtinnen in 2011.
Rpg is both offered to its Web sites, as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary.
Should the mietparteien But, they will not agree on the new miete set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information on the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal approach to understand," rpg says on its Web sites.
"This is no one in court," says one of the working of rpg byty and a man in the street in front of the klientenzentrum gives it at least partly right.
'I have 13 - kronor - Pension, of which 5,000 to eating desired me where I should remain the money for a gerichtsstreit coming from," he says.
Then the employees but uncertain.
"See."
"Mr zaorálek says them on the media, they are not sign and so the people is still on," they are waiting to be considered.
The Czech to neujahr 2011 and regulated miete ends in most of rpg byty is, according to the mieterhöhung an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not enough time to the maintenance of the wohnfonds," Pavel argues klimeš, Director of the wohnungs-portfolios of society rpg byty and - particularly the exasperated mietern, neglect of the wohnungsfonds is the homeowners believes that the main reason for the mieterhöhung.
While rpg in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rent collected four billion in the homes was able to invest in the four years of 2011 until 2014, it should be 5.2 billion.
On the großformatigen lcd-display to the ceiling to the polstersesseln in warteraum havířov are appearing in the meantime again and again a few red shining information.
"The mieterhöhungen by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of rpg."
"Always, that means no more than 7,50 czk per square metre and month" is on the lcd-monitor to read.
Only with 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg has increased the miete by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it has to do with the increase in extremely low mietpreise from 19,66 czk per square metre," rpg argues.
At the same level in 2600 homes remains the miete in the next year.
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation not jumped on the upside is the rent, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - imposed on the company, a further commitment: all of the revenue from the mieterhöhung - see diagramm - Will the company again in the homes are, above all in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and in the wärmedämmung.
But, primarily benefit is that those people, the sign the agreements on the mieterhöhung.
The architects saw a - the Office also requires a kindergarten
The bürogebäude avriopoint in brno is the new headquarters of the company arch.design.
But who would expect a minikindergarten here already, with all that implies, farbenfrohen walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a minispielplatz on the außenterrasse.
This kindergarten is available to the staff of arch.design since last year.
The projektierungs- and architekturbüro arch.design, comes from its ateliers a number of prominent brünner built, was from the first drafts for the new building avriopoint to with the premises for his firmen-minikindergarten.
Wise in, because most of his 90 workers - within - are in the babyboom-alter and the company is keen that the projektantinnen and return to their jobs architektinnen as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of reduced to work, the kindergarten is another bonus, the arch.design its staff in the concept of their sozialprogrammes can offer.
The bauingenieurinnen and -architektinnen have it so easily, their ambitious work and to bring the kinderfürsorge under one roof.
The minikindergarten is the original idea of staff - within - of it, you can arch.design, with the support of its management of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for its project to win.
The occupational minikindergarten by means of the operationsprogramm Human Resources and employment policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and funding from the staatsbudget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding - grants to the tune of 2, czk 8 million - could be obtained the necessary facilities and the equipment and for a period of two years, provides for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After the exhaustion of the aid - 2 years - the society arch.design is committed to continue to pursue the minikindergarten 3 more years at their own cost.
The preparation of this project took a whole year in right, with the society economy rating in the antragsabwicklung active assistance provided.
Takes care of the children ganztätig qualified personnel, a nurse and a kindergartenlehrerin to kindergarten children can visit without any altersmäßige restrictions, even though the majority of them are over three years old.
And because this is a mini-kindergarten, can only 5 children to be present at the same time, however, change the day over several children from each other.
The kindergartenbetrieb is flexible to the needs of the parents have voted, the children of all the staff in relation to the use of the kindergartens - the same rights, without regard to the firmenhierarchie and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, is the programminhalt in mini-kindergarten Nevertheless, comparable to the vorschulbildung Framework Programme.
The children are not offered only, above all, you will be excellent education - of basic knowledge up to and including the vorschulunterricht, by the way they learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative play, but also equipped with a computer, which is available to the children.
What more - the presence of young children in the company will contribute to the friendly and positive firmenmilieu.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and so is the stress on the belated to collect the children from a distant kindergarten.
The parents, therefore use their working hours more productive.
It is no wonder that is also natural and legitimate arbeitgeber-arbeitnehmer-beziehungen are emerging.
Arch.design reihte so under the Czech companies, which are "significant benefits" to provide the familienfreundlich in the recruitment of new staff and bolster their personal- marketing by such programmes.
A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years ago. Just look at the interieure of gaudi
The roof is in how the backs of prähistorischen echse, the steps, such as the vertebral column of dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler.
This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architect Antonio gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants got the house with its organic forms the spitznamen "knochenhaus."
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and mosaiks in just erinnernde fassaden and ubiquitous soft lines, all of this is a common feature for the jugendstil Antonio gaudi.
The front of the house is playing with beautiful lines, zärtlichen paints and texturen which remind you of nature and life.
Only on closer inspection, it noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the whole front even plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung exacerbates the glamour of the colours.
The same schwungvollen lines and tortuous forms control also the home of the House.
Wellenartig geformtes wood copied the fensterrahmen, geländer, zierelemente doors, and even gucklöcher and play.
The House batlló in the quarter eixample in the crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia No 43 was created by the side of a house from the years 1877, the architect emilio sala cortese said.
The reconstruction, having two years and was closed 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló was originally on these are the words about the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end it was the idea gaudís in an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
Outlined the mietshaus Casa batlló antoni gaudí but not alone.
He was working with the architects Josep Maria jujol together.
Just on the reißbrett emerged dekorationen for home the representative of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaiken the facade was his idea.
Was working on the design of the front, however, there are also many other bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and gaudí.
So jujol involved also in the construction of gaudís House güell Casa milá in the park, in which other works of antoni gaudí are.
Soon after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the spitznamen "knochenhaus."
Others called it the "because of the special fensteröffnungsmechanismus yawning house."
It also says that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of Saint George, of the patrons of Catalonia.
But also other bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí outlined a unique zentralheizungssystem for that time for the house with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen.
Something bizarre is their 45-grad-neigung already.
During his create ignored gaudí consistent all bauvorschriften at that time and was not at all of these be led astray.
Before baubeginn he "of the city, the appropriate baugenehmigung but made him information about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later in the completion of were appalled by the result, so much so that they help demanded.
The ratsherren met with, among other things, to ensure that the construction of his pillars, even in the public pavement intervention.
For a change, however, there was no longer quite the opposite, only 15 days after the request of the stadtviertels in this regard, Josep batlló submitted an application for the approval of the vermietung of the two höchstgelegenen stockwerke of the House, and it has been granted him promptly.
The Homeowners themselves, in the lower floors.
In the gallery in the second floor of a gesellschaftssalon, was in the third floor of the bedroom and privaträume was the home.
The erdgeschoss has been sent to a juweliergeschäft verpachtet.
The whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a steps available, right up to the dachterrasse.
By the main elements of the umbaus were all right corner and on lines removed and replaced by gebogene and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a new approach to the mutual link of rooms.
The social part is explained by the opening of the salontüren totally link, and so could a wider society convenient plaudern, without having to avoid a certain amount of intimität in vertraulicheren talks.
The House by gaudís reconstruction of a new front but also received a very unusual roof and two other stockwerke.
Impressively is also gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and white glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard is dressed and the lichthöfe.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
This showed it is the principle to take that knows better reflect the light, as a dark colours, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb.
The House Casa batlló, which was included in the welterbe-liste of UNESCO, 2005 can visit today everybody.
On the first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste home made available to the public.
The Homeowners determined to stay only in years to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator.
When we said that this is a very profitable business, retained the besichtigungen when, in fact it extended it to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse.
The price to besichtigung the baudenkmals is, however, no chicken feed, it is 16,50 euro, students and pensioners, groups and touristenausweisen holder get 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city.
Anyone who wants to learn about the real atmosphere of the house with his drachentürmchen, should try to close friendship with one of the hausbewohner, to visit him at home.
The right matratze and wish the right bettenrost? women are different than men
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - matratze and rost are the good bed.
However, these must be harmonious complement, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In choosing a role - play many things the weight, the size of the health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers.
The interieur, is just as important in the matratze and rost above.
A typical example?
In a wochenendhaus, in which not regularly heated, latexmatratzen are not good, because you need a much longer, in order to "warm."
In addition, they are much more difficult than normal polyurethan-matratzen.
And, they should be changed regularly.
When they do not have enough at the heart of entlüftungskanälchen and even to be on a permanent record staut moisture in, so it is not ruled out that under its is built.
, of course, also plays a role in the election, in which people are used.
Who was for a prolonged period of time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht are common, will be difficult can get used to a low matratze through hard surface.
"Certainly all eishockeyspieler, from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer right sleep here."
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, fersen and hüften they need just a weichschicht being solved from visco-schaum - Memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer -."
"These among other things, I advise diabetics people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that the" information "from the gelenken and skin can receive a bad thing," says Sylva hadamcziková, a reference to polstermöbel specific.
That is why I have many years ago eishockeyspielern being solved, but also other customers this matratzen with visco-schaum - Memory foam - Concerned.
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including manufacturers to tempur tropico to the Italian firm magniflex or the Czech producers."
And we should not necessarily be a famous eishockeyspieler, learn to appreciate the benefits of the visco-schaums.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimalisiert its severity and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt well and truly a warm body.
Nowhere is it, during the night shifts as after a major fight around it is not.
We sleep much better.
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against dekubitus - wundbrand -.
In the choice of the matratzengröße it should contribute to height is still the length of the fußsohlen hinzurechnen, or some 21 to 34 cm.
Men as women, who are in the 180 cm high, need this kind of 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, so together 180 cm.
In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 cm appropriate.
Be half of the komforts and also for any visitors.
Otherwise the following faustregel applies to the ideal bettbreite: "If one is on the back, there should still be enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises ing. helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin of polsterer and raumausstatter, which has been for many years, the issue of healthy schlafes and covers the ergonomie of furniture and this matter on University has put forward.
In a doppelbett, each with its own rost and his own matratze, but to watch the purchase by the matratzen are high in a moment.
Otherwise have no alternative but to fit, than the roste at different levels and that is not in every bettrahmen possible long ago.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, matratzen with federskelett 15 cm, of which should have at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster rejected.
"With the hand or to sit down, we can see the feathers in no way," helena warns prokopová.
Any matratze requires a special rosttyp.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom.
These matratzen cannot be drop and the relation cannot be washing, what today is already commonplace.
And as you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years, is becoming a huge - and congested colander -.
That is also why reject experts werbeslogans, the matratzen a life of up to 25 years, and even life guarantee promise.
Every thing has its but if and.
And that is why a practical COUNCIL OF THE dealers: in matratzen of 120 or 140 feet wide should not shy away from the hygiene of the waschbaren, abziehbaren salary, yet, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, it's easy to use and washing can pull out.
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss will be produced, so to get open after the two halves - immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße! -, the manipulation with greater matratzen, especially alone is carried out, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
You have a firm in bed rather than a rostes plate?
Out with it.
Or a maximum of for a bed for Cinderella guests and for a single night.
Also the plate should be better to have lüftungslöchern oversight - if not in it are - and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with sog. taschenfederkern and feinpolster use.
Polyurethan-matratzen do not belong to in such a documents.
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten - lamellen - are latex- or - perhaps also combinations of latex and kokos - likely sandwichmatratzen, always pay is roste with an increased lattenanzahl, about 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte.
On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, since it is not on the ergonomische verstellung respond.
In addition to the attitude of the stiff federleisten are being offered the Special flexible schultermodule.
We are talking about a special federleisten Gaza, which will make it possible to implement the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, as it is the isolated einsinken allow the shoulder of the schläfers.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter.
There are even matratzenhersteller, which have started to use in "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich.
Is also to the ladies thought, you gönnt this weichzonen in the hüftgegend.
For demanding consumers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme - lattoflex - or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with sog. multitorsionsfederung determined.
The pressure on a number of points will be distributed, which the tension decreased.
But, if it at the right matratze and right rost a bad - too much and fülliges - kopfkissen used, lost most of the benefits are off.
Faustregel here, too: the kopfkissen is the head is based, Its leaders should only up to shoulder the rich, so that the schultermuskeln can ease.
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm wide kissen, for example, as it may the Scandinavians.
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen - together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze - compensate for the schulterhöhe.
Have our modern matratzen have something in common with the former - with Hay so - strohsäcken but.
More and more natural materials, or at least their mixtures use modern producers.
Also in matratzen is the new magic formula "organic."
Instead of erdölrohstoffen is used to produce polyurethanschäumen naturelle oils, for example, rizinus- and sojaöl becoming more common.
Soya is likely to be used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic is to say in matratzen, that your heart is composed of materials purely natural origin," said Petr vašíček tropico plus of the company.
Naturstoffe but will also be used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera.
But we can also be mikrokapseln sleep on the fresh wald- or lavendelduft spread.
Also here is there is a difference between men and women.
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cool the body, have the salary for women "wärmende" to be effective.
Extrakte from red paprikaschoten rain the blutzirkulation to, the weaker sex to sleep so wohlig warm.
And today's favoriten?
Matratzen from kaltschaum - he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard - polyurethan and also much more flexible.
Through the combination of the various stiff - tough - of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen, create the know exactly where head, hip and fersen are.
For a quality matratze has, however, to berappen 7000 kronor and more.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually with lower VAT is, since they are considered medical tools.
Receiving the first Czech companies have gumotex this advantage.
You see, in the matratze and on to save rost is not as easy as it seems.
From time to time there are sonderangebote of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen offer for the price of one.
So the brand magniflex provides the matratze duofreeze with in regard verstepptem being solved visco-schaum memory for 11.990 czk.
The second we get free to do so.
It was the material tempur that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe launched with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem speed.
No surprise, they have been developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are with the launch huge überbelastungen suspended.
Tempur in heat soft, in a cool setting it, in turn, strengthens.
So it is perfect to the human body and distributed on the körperdruck optimum way.
It is, therefore, not only to prevent druckbrand ideal, but generally the schlafkomfort increased.
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, for instance, used in particular fußpolstern to give the legs and the gefäßen relief.
Local manufacturers use for example of the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte, in order to have the kids under control
The fear for their own children is growing and consider more and more parents, you by GPs to monitor.
The system, which was originally to fahndung after cars invented, can people places as well, which would be helpful in such cases, as the spurlosen disappearance of the neunjährigen recently anička janatková.
The device is about the same size as a zigarettenschachtel but at the moment it should not be greater than a armbanduhr soon.
Many people has appointed to the case of the missing anička in fear and terror, and so do you think, looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of a impairment of their right to privacy.
"What we are trying to all to say that it is not in any way herumspionieren, it is an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it will lead to the tragedy is," Petr pilin from the society macro because of one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market.
"I have to admit that it can go to the abuse of such equipment in isolated cases, for example, if there is someone in the bag is, without He knows this, but so far we have had no such case has been made."
"Most of the customers buy it really for security reasons," adds pilin.
His opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "kind would" serves and how they are being used in the event of an emergency.
The kinderpsychologin dana bočková, however, points out that a child, when it emptied may not bear such a thing, it's easy.
"Very small children show a great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"Already the mobile phones set initially at the parents high expectations, but they can be as easy to shut down, as this new überwachungsgeräte," Mrs bočková says.
In your opinion is also questionable whether such an institution in the event of an attack actually help.
"At planned kidnappings, the kidnapper controls virtually always, whether the child any electronics in has, with which it could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"if such were überwachungsgeräte broader use, they would find them too, as their sale would be certainly accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
It acknowledges, however, that similar equipment in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful.
Roberta čech RC monitoring by the company, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen both for cars, as well as offers to people that can help the existence of such a gerätes then, if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
STOP "the machine can be so that it disclose the respective positions in certain intervals."
"Even if it would immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos are the machine, sends an immediate warning remains below indication of the position," said Mr čech.
His opinion, similar services could also do the smart mobile phones with navigation and it just needs a particular piece of software einzuspielen.
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either about equipment in streichholzschachtel-größe, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones.
Always, so the risk that it down.
Mr pilin according to the macro because it is in the present testing devices, the look like ordinary digitaluhren.
"It has the advantage that the possible attackers does not to realise that this is a surveillance or ortungsgerät is.
Only after a certain time," or he can see what the police is a zeitvorsprung," he adds.
No matter what direction the development in - out to armbändern or supporters, always will be the same technology is used, such as the fahrzeugortung.
So the combination of ortungsfunktion by means of the gps-systems - just as the navi in the car - and disclose the function of a mobile phone for which the current position.
The army has so many zündschnüre, that it is the Czech Republic umwickeln they could keep but only two years
The Czech Army be released 445 kilometres, purchased zündschnüre with explosives were used.
In the year before the Defense Ministry had already 224 km zündschnur delivered to the armeelager.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years.
The problem is only the span of the zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The army, bought the zündschnüre the company stv GROUP a. s. for läppische 40 million kronor.
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of zündschnur said the General Staff issued mf dnes, the soldiers would each year from the 60 kilometres zündschnur use.
According to the research of armeepyrotechnikern mf dnes point raised, it is clear from this indication that the whole army, would have a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year - all generals and officers of the armeekommandos, right up to the secretaries and putzfrauen.
Defense Minister alexandr Vondra, and army general vlastimil picek not excluded.
Only in this way could be significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length calls for 25,000 detonationen.
But even so they could armeebestände rich for more than ten years.
But if nor the old rule of experts is that the training of any new military professionals two metres zündschnur is quite sufficient, then, by this, the army has neueinkäufe - from the point of view of the increased needs of the pionier- and special units - created a reassuring stockpile for the already mentioned, 225 years.
However complained soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently on Secretary of Defense Vondra, they had almost no patronen for small arms, so that schießübungen are severely restricted because of the lack of funds.
Not to mention the unterhosenmangel.
"Me, is also not, why they buy such quantities of zündschnüre from us."
But this is your final decision, they are already know what they need to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as traders largely contrary to want to come," says the vertriebsmanager stv group Jan děcký.
Jan pejšek, the Defense Department spokesman justified the procurement of hundreds of kilometres of zündschnur so that the army has been so for at least ten years with this," eingedeckt ammunition."
Jan děcký talks of the stv group but only by a four years of gebrauchsdauer zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even only in two years' time.
The four mentioned years possible "with perfect storage are likely," puts one of them, but wants to remain ungenannt in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
At the end of the gebrauchsdauer any weapons must be thoroughly tested, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument in the Defense Department is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres zündschnur.
"It cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 244 miles," the spokesman pejšek tells us the position of the einkäufer of the Defense Department.
Only for comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren pyrotechnikern the police, the ammunition in the Second World War, or the Soviet bruderarmee withdraw, even for a number of years hardly exceeds 1500 metres.
And the police only ever ordered such quantities of these weapons, which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can use.
The security is already the pyrotechniker because of, it is also the opportunity to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable zündschnüre open.
The Defense Ministry has already massive problems for the liquidation tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition in times of the Warsaw treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak prepared People's Army in its campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes raised, expected the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem in the liquidierung of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre, which she has purchased today as "good."
Until now, I have the contacts concerned, which I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious platzierung in competition," Small Entrepreneurs of the Year "have lukáš pytloun helped in the sale of his franchise hotels.

From the savings from its ferienarbeiten abroad and with the help of a bankkredits erstand it a baufälliges house with five homes.
Bearing in mind that he was hochschulstudent in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a daunting.
"The earlier preis-qualität-verhältnis angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says lukáš pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte apartment rented to be auslandsarbeiter.
The whole of the profit it invested back into the house, which he then immediately step by step to pension with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then it managed business activity in liberec four pensions in just seven years, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels with a gesamtkapazität from more than 300 beds to open all the unterkunftskategorien.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the viersternehotel "pytloun design hotel."
In this year, another first hotel added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in ostrov U tisé, which we have sold our franchise-konzept and other interested parties in the franchise of the pytloun-hotels have already reported" NUMBER ONE, says the company last year.
"Great share of this lizenzverkauf at the behest of hotels had just the victory in the competition" businessmen of the year, "Mr pytloun adds appreciation added.
The victory has made him more bekanntheit, is popular in liberec and environment.
"The people have recognized me on the street, they often congratulated me even further and I must say, that was done really well," he pointed out.
I really commend all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You also need not equal to gain any sichtbarmachung is good.
Up to now, he says that he and acquaintances benefits from the contacts, to which it would otherwise be not come at all.
"with some of the people I have met thanks to the competition, I still hold regular business contacts."
The glory is linked to the success of his opinion, also a little bit down in any of its workers.
And since he has to the 70.
"I see in them greater loyalty and proud to be able to say that they are part of something, the general recognition allocated to it."
I do not see this really only as a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something in the forefront," says lukáš pytloun modest.
My successors, I wish a ruhigeres year than we have had in farmet
The siegeseuphorie was replaced quickly from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, farmet the worst.
The price for first place in the competition vodafone company of the year in the last jahrgang, Karel žďárský forward to the firmeninhaber of farmet.
The Panel to decide He paid tribute to the efforts at that time, with those from the small werkzeugbau a business in Česká skalice improvised parliamentary out of the ground, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this recognition of not only myself but also encouraged all my staff and our confidence in the fight with the competition has encouraged," says the vorjahresgewinner.
At the start of the firmengeschichte of farmet was an effort to do something useful.
And as the State then his father Karel žďárský as that of the Communists confiscated property compensation for a small werkstatt offered to lease, he did not last long, made his career in the company, in which he was working until then ditch and his father founded with a few friends a separate company for the production of plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to focus on pflanzenölpressen.
Fit within 18 years of age are the largest producer of automatic throughout Central Europe's.
But only mentioned by the success in the competition and its medialisierung is it into awareness of the nicht-fachöffentlichkeit come to pass.
"Not only accept that our customers the brand farmet now more clear, our foreign partners began the fact to be able to work with a firm in their country has achieved the greatest possible success, greater value to," says Karel žďárský.
The past year has been at farmet, however, not only in the sign of the siegeseuphorie.
The appreciation has dropped from The economic results of the company in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of werkzeugbauprodukten.
The crisis, much less the citizens at the time, but above all companies schüttelte, reached its peak just - many companies were forced to suspend their investment plans and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"This situation we have of course not escape."
"The sales reduced by 40 percent, we had to reduce the production and even resort to redundancies," says Karel žďárský
A viable companies must also sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it was able to get the situation under control and to keep the company in the black figures, even if lower profits than before the crisis.
In a the company was not willing to make any compromise - in the investment in the research and development.
"From the contribution we built a research and schulungszentrum, we bestärkten measure our presentation at international and hauptpreise gained in domestic exhibitions," žďárský says.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales grow again and with them, the number of new staff.
"I wish the new winner much joy of victory, but in more calm," does Karel žďárský towards.
An opinion poll, the clean up in fruitless rules
The opinion poll "the absurdity of the year" is part of the unternehmerwettbewerbs for the fourth time.
Some crazy to create rules were already, from the world.
The dubious winner of the next jahrgangs the opinion poll has become a "absurdity of the Year" in the duty to create documents to authorities, which are available online.
It took more than a third of not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the sozialversicherungsverwaltung demanded a papierauszug from the handelsregister, even if the officials would have it by two mausklicks can retrieve.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this will change now.
"The Czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung will in future in inspections of sozialversicherungszahlern not extracts from the handelsregister asking for more,," the Speaker of čssz jana buraňová.
Meaning and purpose of the opinion poll 'absurdity of the year," it is all regulations and orders to scrutinise, the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to perform and lift the unreasonable.
This was the fourth time in this year have been part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs, which is organised by the tsch. wirtschaftszeitung - hn - and enjoyed growing popularity in the public domain.
If the last year, it was involved in the three thousand people in the vote in four thousand earlier this year.
No surprise, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, the only serve to prevent the business operations.
"What, for example, the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned, we are taking the top rank in the world," said Karel havlíček by the Association of small and mittelständiger companies and gewerbetreibender of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity is the proclaimed goal of all governments in the last few years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic, however, hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen 74. Place a worse platzierung a by eight seats, in comparison with the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was declared for the first time in years and plays for equal scenario from every year.
Everyone can from April to the redaktionsschluss administrative and bureaucratic nonsense report of competition at the end of September.
The website address to the notification is www.firmaroku.cz. then is seeking the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the antipreis "and" does the public online on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
It prevails the absurdity that gets the most votes.
To this year's poll has already been registered more than a hundred, or more precisely 105 senseless rules and orders.
The tipps are not only of entrepreneurs, but also of associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalisten" of the competition are So for example, provisions that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge on highways and have to pay schnellstraßen toll or that entrepreneurs with 20 members of staff, two offices and two toilets have to vorrichten every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
Each of the proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November at the Prague wenzelsplatz is part of a happenings, in which regularly, to participate in the political and public figures.
Earlier this year, for example, Eva svobodová, the director of the nuclear or mittelständiger smaller businesses and gewerbetreibender tsch. Republic and the Republic of tsch. Petr kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce at the height of the competition with the game.
Stick between the legs," where the state entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my aim to lift each year at least thirty paragraphs, which today even unnecessary their businesses with more difficult," Martin kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade said.
The efforts to create perverse orders from the world, show effect.
In the year 2007 disrupted the people most duty on the entrepreneurs, the gewerbeamt at the place of their permanent plant site three days in advance the intention to declare, with a ausstellungsstand wishing to travel to an exhibition or kirmes.
This duty force an amendment of gewerbegesetzes was lifted.
The duty received the largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty, the report arbeitsamt trips of people employed in the scope of up to 30 days to must - was removed by the law sog. "Green Card" on them.
And - All good things are three:
The absurdity of the year 2009, there was elected the Regulation, the physiotherapeuten put on a mirror, a refrigerator and two in the sprechzimmer personenwaagen have to be.
This Regulation, the Ministry of Health in mellowed somewhat - the kühlschrankpflicht fell way this year.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria, humanitarian and environmental, education or sportprojekte

Idea of this competition is, reasonable and fair activities to promote.

The year's first jahrgang this particular unterkategorie of the hauptwettbewerbs vodafon company firms for which the success of the year has is not the only long term objective.
The history of each of them is very inspirativ and would provide enough substance for an autonomous rule.
Even though they differ with regard to the subject of the activity diametral, their efforts, however, have a common denominator - support and accommodation.
Here it is for example, gehandicapte people, because of personal problems or the health of their own staff.
Among the 14 finalisten from across the Czech Republic appeared as, for example, the Prague software et netera that supports the emergence of not formal sportteams among its staff, who would then take part in many play in various sports.
Another example of good company from the region isolit-bravo pardubice is the Society, which have been hauptsponsor is one of stiftungsfonds for gehandicapte children for 17 years.

Pilsner bodenfonds - arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the bodenfonds in pilsen in the last few days, the antikorruptionspolizei arrests.
It was the European medien-unternehmer and immobilienhändler luboš G. transferred by the detektiven in of handcuffs.
This was supposedly tried to a public competition to be held just for the conduct of restitutionsansprüchen to manipulate, so much so that the land, a specific interested parties in zufielen offered in the competition.
This should luboš G. half a million have paid for it.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police pursued a person because of the delikts fraudulent activity, in a public competition," said antonie zelená, the chefin of the pilsner Public Prosecutor of the newspaper "právo," further details could not provide you with regard to the current investigations.
Released 24 hours later, the 46-jährige entrepreneurs again by the police.
The way in which he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can only speculate in view of the failure to official information.
The speaker of the bodenfonds lubomír černá referred to include the issue of právo, the police have, in the pilsner antenna of the bodenfonds actually made arrests during a public competition.
"It was about a clients and not by one of our staff," she konkretisierte.
According to the public competition Mrs černá was the full name of "Invitation to angebotsabgabe demands to transfer of land, according to the bodengesetz" and would take place in cases in which several applicants bezeigen offered interest in the property.
"These people are in the framework of the call to begleichenden a higher value of their by the transfer of a restitutionsansprüche when the grundstückswert proclaimed."
"in accordance with the demands offered, the order of the potential erwerber, then gives the bodenfonds set the land to the person with the highest offer," said the Speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. obviously information were available, who had expressed to the call out and since he himself was reasonable person, because he had bought a number of restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a grundstücksinteressen that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
It would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had in his arrest in such a large amount of money.
Luboš G. had already in the past, very good contacts to the pilsner bodenfonds.
So, too, he played a role in the causa of the former head of the bodenfonds Vaclav sankota stressing, was prosecuted because he ersatzrestitutionen pieces of land, which had already been taken standortentscheidungen to construction projects.
At that time, luboš G. acquired by the bodenfonds for example, plots of land, which was originally intended to build public roads, or more precisely, to the place, where the construction of the zufahrtsmagistrale to gewerbegebiet borské pole was planned.
Later, he tauschte this extremely successful, with the magistrat against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The City Hall in at that time with a heavy heart had to kleinbeigeben, in order not to jeopardise the building projects by the blockage of the land.
The wohnkosten of households increase by a few hundred per month
The households from January must not only with higher costs for all energiearten count, but with more water and abwassergebühren and for district heating and grow the rent in some quarters.
Families are being so from January, several hundred kronor per month must learn more from the wallets than before.
Electricity is up by 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more in some cities, it will be up to a tenth of the fernwärmelieferungen must pay more for wasserlieferungen and make some more expensive.
The stromteuerung alone will cost the wohnungshaushalte SEK a few hundred more every year.
The starkstrompreise have been reduced it by all hauptlieferanten, is to blame the clear support of the electricity production from renewable sources, notably from fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas will be only modestly more expensive, but this is exactly when the people most heating and must have the highest consumption.
There is therefore also with several hundred kronor to be more per year.
While electricity and gas across the Czech Republic will be more expensive to, the prices of different district heating from city to city.
Above all, more places are planning price increases.
For example, the households in pardubice and hradec must králové from January pay more for district heating up to 50 kronor per month, more than 1, 000 families in liberec pay kronor more per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 percent higher water and abwassergebühren and this is the case that the CITY OF THE infrastrukturmiete increased.
If the miete does not change, it is just 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, Czech Republic, however, to continue to be the lowest compared to the whole.
In the nordböhmen, where the prices already are among the highest, are expected to rise water and abwassergebühren by 7.4 percent.
Huge mietpreiserhöhungen, for example, are expected in 140, 000 mietwohnungen from January, in which the sog. mietregulierung ended.
In the planning for example, the wohnungsunternehmen cpi byty, which has in ústí nad labem 2500 homes, in order to increase hundred per cent. The same rent from January
Those who do not agree with this mieterhöhung, is the legal proceedings against the company.
The regulated rent, which are still in approximately 300,000 homes pays, should increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children betrinken with fernet and rum beer is out, it is simply too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for time a good whisky, which was the father of stolen from the hausbar.
These are the drinks, after which need to be drunk Czech teenagers under 15 most notbehandelt enjoy.
No exception are children, their kater repeatedly in the hospital ausschlafen must.
This is clear from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the opening of the kinderabteilungen of clinics.
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said právo luděk pelikán, the chefarzt kinderabteilung in the hořovice mittelböhmischen clinic.
"whisky, if we are successful, the father of a bottle of entwenden from the hausbar and, if not, then at least fernet or vodka.
"vodka has the advantage of that you can mix it with juice, then, it is not so strong," says the chefarzt.
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right.
"Most it is fernet or rum."
"That is the alkoholtrend, notably in schools." Today
"We also wanted to take on board slibowitz, it could be said that at home well," led Mrs jurinová.
Chefarzt pelikán, according to dreizehn- or vierzehnjährige drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme no ausnahmeerscheinung long ago.
Before the clinic in hořovice, in which he works for this year, he was in the pädiatrie-abteilung in hospital motol for ten years, where the rettungswagen angetrunkene pupils from far and wide ablieferten.
"A girl had to be four times hospitalisiert."
"Your career started it with 12 years ago, when it the first time with 3.5 level of alcohol in the blood and still, it was taken in combination with" extase "was" a very serious case, described the doctor.
"It was in the ausstellungsgelände in holešovice in some tanzparty."
"The interesting is that it is not strange mentioned their mother that her daughter 48 hours was not home," is the chefarzt surprised.
That lack of interest of the parents or the incredible tolerance at the start with their own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism for children.
With a real interdependence in the true sense of the word is not in children, according to experts.
"under Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and to understand all related phenomenon, and that is not the case with these children."
With those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, is generally a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic," says chefarzt pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital motol, Mrs according to jurinová, by the middle of November around 40 drunken children were in the European Department of Child Care and jugendmedizin eingewiesen.
Only the cases with severe alkoholvergiftung, however, which made a krankenhausaufenthalt needed to go in the statistics.
Drunken children who, in ambulatory care of their parents or, if necessary, will be brought home not registered by the police.
Except the cases in which children only times as a bottle of schnaps in the schulbank austrinken Mr pelikán believe that there are three jahreszeitliche amplituden the one hundred per cent is good,: walpurgisnacht being New Year's Eve and the end of the academic year.
"the latter for two reasons, either from pain due to the poor zeugnisses or from joy on the holidays."
"In the walpurgisnacht I have seen in the opening seven drunk children at once," said Dr pelikán.
A betrunkenes child, paradoxically, spent the night under medical supervision, is better off as a child, the only has to contend with a unpleasant kater the next day.
The headache in the morning, then that emanate from the dehydration and the glukosemangel, can you in the hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion missing, which the organism, drive out with glukose and nutrients.
"Clearly they are better off because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise it with good humour to hurts, without taking."
"They are just a little confused as to where they are," Dr pelikán acknowledges, but at least it the patients Sometimes this good humour by it cost them the reality in it, which will cost them the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rettungswagen and the night in a akutbett are well and to look at a few tens of thousands of kronor.
"From time to time, I have used that as erziehungsmittel, if I have directly to the children in the trip vorgerechnet, which has cost their drunkenness well, and that it can happen that you ever have to work on the whole holidays in order to earn the money for such a single fete," Dr pelikán added.

Two trainingsflugzeuge l-159 in foreign hand - for the first time in Spain
Two light fighter planes l-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Defense Ministry against the transportflugzeug Casa c-295m has replaced, on Tuesday went to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish flugzeughersteller Casa - EADS siedelt.
It is the first time that are aircraft of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were so far only in manoeuvres or flugshows to see.
This is the flugfähige zweisitzerversion l-159t1, which was conducted by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige l-159.
These are being einkonserviert at aero vodochody, the mediator of this involved - the company omnipol - has adopted last week.
When the aircraft physically from vodochody expediert, Jan pejšek, according to the spokesman for the Defense Department, is still not known.
The einsitzigen fighter plane l-159, in turn, were from eingelagerten aircraft singled out in the long term and that without more deposits and investments on the part of the Department of the Ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen l-159t1 were in current state and be replaced," the paper pejšek právo said.
He added that the army will not have to do without zweisitzige fighter planes, because the Defense Ministry in May 2009, with aero vodochody a 200-millionen-vertrag on the reorganization of the four unnecessary l-159 signed to the zweisitzigen version.
A new aircraft, the army has taken over in July, the second wants to take it by the end of this year.
According to pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforce the fighter planes in the equipment of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty is clearly expressed that the company EADS buyer of the aircraft is l-159 and that this should serve in the training of pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is up to the abnehmers, therefore, in what way he realised the matter," led pejšek.
The wirtschaftszeitung - hn - had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the l-159.
The trading one thing for another five l-159 against a transportflugzeug Casa and the purchase of new aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor last year, was approved by the Government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Defense Ministry was not tender at shopping at the time, but EADS spoke directly to put out to tender.
The then verteidigungsamt argued that this exchange will support the future exports of the l-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought aero 72 machines from, of which they used only 24, it wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa also may still have a legal sequel.
The European Commission, sued the Czech Defense Ministry at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have been the aircraft due to select a ganzeuropäischen tender and not by a single mention producers.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last to end up on the airport kbely within 14 days.
A longer finger, but instead ringfinger means a lower risk of contracting cancer
Men, whose divided is long, when the ringfinger are obvious of contracting a lower risk of prostate cancer.
It is the surprise result of a study, which was published by the British Journal of cancer on Wednesday.
This is associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer and the mitautorin this especially as men and 60," said the study, ros eeles, Professor in warwick on krebsforschungsinstitut at the university.
The finger could help to determine what men is important to have a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially when there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as the family health burden, Mrs eeles added.
In the period from 1994-2009 followed it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study was the divided the right hand shorter than the ringfinger.
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those were men, whose ring- and divided equally long.
For men, whose divided longer than the ringfinger was fell by 33 percent, however, the risk for men by sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers, which has been mentioned in the prenatal old form, clearly reflects the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen, which has been under the child in the womb.
Less testosteron is a longer divided.
Earlier research showed that it is the testosteron speed up the growth of prostate cancer.
Vaclav pačes leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said čtk that he was aware of these study fleeting, but he believe the relations between the fingerlänge and have not so far for the risk of cancer "is proven."
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and d5 are closed
As well as the biggest part of Europe is also the Czech Republic on Thursday morning under a schneedecke.

American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
The American troops have deployed in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon, so far the only under their codebezeichnung xm-25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influenced the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favour.
The new weapon is such a thing as a pointed supergenaue gun.
Their projektile i.e. by lasers drawn with a treffsicherheit of only a few metres into the goal.
The specific bullets of mould 25 mm, which have been developed for this machine gun and hochexplosiven contained explosives, work practically in small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed, that they not only in terms of impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic flugbahn can explode.
That means that you can use them against an enemy, which is hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in the schützengraben.
He is usually is not protected from above, the murderous stahlsplitterregen from top so it is easy to set out of combat.
According to Richard audett, who is participating in the development of the xm-25, the first is the new kampfgewehr infanteriewaffe, the "smart" takes advantage of technologies.
"The soldier is basically as before: he visiert the objective to and sends out a laserstrahl determined the distance, as it will gain a precise visierpunkt, after declaring the erhöhungswinkel corrected, then only abzudrücken he needs.
"We say that one has 543 m measured."
"If you abdrückt, to load the weapon and shooting the geschoss to remove 543 metres plus the minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs are being transferred
The company Fujitsu shifted its branch in bad homburg after Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 staff from the previous bürogebäude their jobs are on marienbader place in bad homburg move in the astro park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu shifted its branch in bad homburg after Frankfurt.
As the computers and their maintenance specialist branchenriese on Wednesday indicated, in July of next year will be 400 men and women from the previous bürogebäude their jobs on marienbader place in bad homburg move in the astro Park, this is a great bürokomplex in the lyoner street in Frankfurt district niederrad.
A Speaker of Fujitsu explained, in the medium term, should there be placed the group's another 100 jobs, which are distributed so far in the region.
The mietangebot is very attractive, and would have been better against the großraumbüros on astro Park of the operation of the staff.
Also had been in bad homburg Fujitsu was just tenants.
With frankfurt-niederrad the competent CEO Bernd Wagner said, "we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent linked to the airport is especially important for a global companies such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region called yesterday delight in the clear winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt wirtschaftsdezernent Markus frank - CDU - said, so that won is once again a "global player."
This was a "great standortbekenntnis."
Fujitsu passe to the city, the establishment is an important stimulus for niederrad.
The bad homburger Mayor Michael korwisi - the green - he regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city had been early informed about the intention of reduced the management.
"We have offered our assistance," said korwisi, of course, the businesses.
The friendly contacts, however, would have nothing to the difficulties of the computerherstellers can change in the marienbader place with the vermieter property.
At the end of the day would have been decided by economic reasons.
Leaving now, it is a matter to prevent a long leerstand in such a prominent place.
"I hope that the owners and vermieter of the building is helpful."
The House on rathausplatz Fujitsu has so far been used and the neighbouring "small vertical" included with the other buildings on marienbader square in front of the kurstadt ten years to the most controversial construction projects.
As a common project drawn up between the city and a private projektentwicklers station and City Hall in a new stadtentree that both because of the huge development of land used previously partly as a parking lot, as well as the level of the buildings for criticism.
2001 was the anlageberatungs- and ratingunternehmen feri, the software-hersteller for reisevertriebssysteme, start amadeus, and at the time still associated with Siemens computerhersteller Fujitsu houses.
The building was used by Fujitsu 2006 by the Frankfurt German immobilien-chancen-gruppe acquired together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later to the Spanish falcon real estate investments sa resold in Madrid.
The fujitsu-konuzern calls itself as the world's third largest it-provider based in Tokyo.
It is companies, for example, computers and server prepared and also makes the necessary service.
The branch in the rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, far more employees, including Fujitsu, however, in Munich.
From bad homburg is the subsidiary Fujitsu technology solutions in frankfurt-niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this location should be Fujitsu services and a company called tds.
For that, in the bürogebäude chartered seven thousand square metre astro park.
In the 20 years old complex - the name plays in his sternförmigen grundriss to, among other things, the zentralverband elektrotechnik- and elektronikindustrie its headquarters.
Amazon server - threats against assange balks
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
The internet-dienstleister Amazon has banned the enthüllungsplattform from his servern.
There is perhaps political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomaten-depeschen. More
Wikileaks-gründer assange is supposed to be in England.
The Wikileaks enthüllungsplattform is increasingly come under attack in the United States.
The internet-aktivisten lost access to their previous American server and are now a internet-heimat in Europe.
The prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman, however, other countries and companies to boycott of WikiLeaks.
And wikileaks-gründer Julian assange, which is on the fahndungslisten of Interpol, should stop after a zeitungsbericht in Britain.
"WikiLeaks of amazon-server crowded out."
"free speech in the land of the free," shared the enthüllungs-aktivisten by kurznachrichtendienst Twitter - local time - with on Wednesday.
Shortly before the internet-unternehmen Amazon had the wikileaks-dokumente from his servern exiled.
The internet-aktivisten had in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeschen resorted to the Amazon Web service - AWS - to be able to manage the high zugriffszahlen on the documents.
By Twitter WikiLeaks to told the step further: 'Fine - our dollars will be spent to employ people in Europe."
If such Amazon have problem with the freedom of speech," they should stop to sell books."
Amazon have stopped making use of its server by WikiLeaks after personnel by Senator Joe Lieberman investigation had told the television channel CNN by referring to the Office liebermans.
The Chairman of the senatsausschusses had for heimatschutz Amazon, reported the British "guardian" threatened with a boycott.
"I would have liked to see that Amazon sooner is taking this measure in view of the previous publications klassifizierter information by WikiLeaks," the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called to do so, the platform also in other countries to deny the use to servern.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, ungeheuerliches and reckless action is part of our national security at risk and at risk in every corner of the globe," hießt it live in a communication of the leading French senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or ausländisch - should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks-gründer assange, because of vergewaltigungsverdachts in Sweden is being sought by the authorities, is on the fahndungsliste of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australians known in Britain was on, the exact place Scotland Yard brought.
The internet-aktivist the investigation in Sweden has always described as divide his opponents.
Wikileaks-sprecher kristinn hrafnsson said in London, there had been threats.
"There were even calls to murder of Julian assange."
That is why assange rightly fear for his safety, said hrafnsson.
The wikileaks-gründer will therefore continue to keep hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously was responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of arkansas, Mike huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the wikileaks-enthüllungen should be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada said a adviser to Prime Minister Stephen harper - apparently - on television, ironically assange should be "killed" and Obama could "A drohne benefits."
Between the White House and assange tool entbrannte to start a battle.
The American President Barack Obama, spokesman Robert gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that assange asked for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for recently estimated spionage-aufforderungen more to diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we are concerned about the views of a types with a web site," gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its a web page."
The US government is now the protection of their databases fully to the test.
As a special envoy was the vize-direktor of the Centre for anti-terror-maßnahmen, russell travers, been appointed, the White House said.
Travers was responsible for this," necessary structural reforms "to develop, after the disclosure of the botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks had become necessary.
The White House is also trying to look into ways as the entire Government information exchange and safeguards.
The US government also announced that want to provide for the safety of dissidents and most active, they should be by the wikileaks-veröffentlichung in danger.
"We have done everything we can to come in contact with them," außenamtssprecher Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to protect them, if that should become necessary."
The eis-universität
At the "gelato university" in Bologna eiskonditoren prepared for better seasons.
The three grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest violence and visitors from all over the world.
What is important is all the ice?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, something altertümlich the eiskonditor in German, the cream after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst since.
The gelataio pulls the eiscreme with a spachtel from the kühltheke, delete them in the waffel and then sold them.
In order to know this, you do not have to anzola Dell emilia drive in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, which is not yet in the "gelato-university" of the Italian company carpigiani over.
The eis-universität, the manufacturers of eismaschinen in 2003 set up so that the eiscreme from its machines lived up to the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest violence and visitors from around the world.
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and work experience in the hauseigenen eisdiele.
Some in the midlife-crisis dreams of a new career, other car simply time to downright hold their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky kunstlehrer in California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants to offer quality in the country, the industrial ice-cream a European future product.
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants to, after years in a nervenaufreibenden job a little eintüten of its own.
Two young ägypterinnen dream of, in Cairo to start a eisdiele.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of eiscreme in their bars, and the Canadian housewife Yulia is because their children Italian eiscreme love.
Maestro-gelatiere luciano Ferrari declared the participants first of all the ideal characteristics of perfect eiscreme.
It is crucial not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget in his training but also the icing on the cake of national and südländischen at all überbaus." Italian gelato is simply the best, and there is also a lot of romanticism to play."
The first step to the production seems very simple.
Luciano kippt the grundzutaten milk, put cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a huge mixgerät that all this with an electronic programme heated to 85 degrees and then immediately to four degrees slows.
Then he is a Hahn, and out of the flight comes a pasteurisierte white basiscreme basis for all milcheissorten.
Right now, the dozent with questions bestürmt: can we eiscreme produce only with natural substances without stabilisator?
How can you let the own experimentierlust free course?
Luciano warns to be lead by the spirit in the mistaken.
Who eiscreme "only from natural ingredients" speech, has perhaps yet stabilizers is used, often a product of nature, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne.
Of course you can also produce without stabilisator ice, but it must then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt together, and the customer bite on eiskörnchen increase.
Some variations in the grundmasse are allowed.
With the flavourings, there will be more exciting.
The ice for the taste is different maestro luciano between the ingredients, the people in the obst-abteilung or in the supermarktes buying sweets.
Also, there are powder and pasten.
"The suppliers are all try to anzudrehen dozens of aromatisierte additions them."
"But they should have simply time to experiment."
Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh früchten.
Or just for the eiscreme from the White grundmasse, who with eggs on the yellow cream, with kakaopulver the basis for all sorts of schokoladen-verführungen.
The kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen must now.
Luciano allows it to four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and achieve haselnuss-eis, with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural zusätzen.
The same test will be subject to the fruchteissorten.
More aromas which, more frucht-püree - more is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-eis is not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts.
The favorite kiwi-eis is the working party, since, the More fruits, less water and a little less stabilisator used.
Only a balanced mix stress the taste of a gelato right, says luciano.
Eisherstellung is a rechenaufgabe: will pfirsich-püree with high sugar used the zuckeranteil in the grundrezept must be reduced.
For zitroneneis a extraportion sugar is needed.
Luciano shows is a machine, with which he determined the sugar content of the fruchtsorten - wine producers are concerned so that the oechsle measure in the traubenmost -.
Fortunately, the rechnerei facilitate tables.
To make ice requires not more physical use as much as it used to be.
Not only the machine for the automatic production of the grundmasse helps.
There is also a device, in which the completed eis-mischung cremig beaten, and at the same time to minustemperaturen kept.
In spite of all the automatisierung remain small accidents.
The Brazilians gustavo bekleckert itself and its kurskollegen with fruchtpüree than it from top to bottom of the überdimensionale stabmixer spiral out of control.
"In every direction," says maestro luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in the zwielicht
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA was among the with genpflanzen experimentierenden industry undermined.
Now the group testbiotech formulated the accusation, the role as an independent Institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a verschwörungstheorie, but we have well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte were also in the lobbyistenverband for years ilsi under contract.
It is paid by companies like Monsanto, nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper have contributed significantly to the efsa-prüfvorschriften for genpflanzen and stand with criticized in a clear conflict of interest, then.
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise wortgleich with positionspapieren ilsi and deceive so that the hand of industry, which should be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is the second time that testbiotech already a interessenskollision bemängle.
So is a high level efsa-managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period to the Swiss agrarkonzern syngenta - and I have to ensure that the sides.
Also the mitteldeutsche radio - mdr - had recently human links between kontrollierender EU agency and industry lobby, reveals what it has done umweltbundesamt as well as eu-parlamentarier suspicious.
However, the EFSA can see no conflict of interest.
We will take back to every serious data, also to the industry, such as long as they are of a high professional standards, it said in a statement.
By the experts who work for EFSA, we do not want you have no contact with the industry.
It but they would have to disclose.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute - ilsi - in the United States.
This described themselves as neutral forum for experts from science, industry and without lobbyauftrag policy, among other things, to risikoabschätzung in biotechnology.
Criticise as then independent experts on the matter, that genetically modified plants at the moment without any fütterungsversuch in animals are registered and the response from genpflanzen to environmental factors will not be tested.
"We want to know what, for example of genetically modified corn on the acker power," says then.
Current practice is it, just isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test, what liefere no reliable results.
"If it is seeking the risks not as they should find?" asks then anklagend.
It also includes Angelika hilbeck.
The scientist research since 1994 function in the Zurich direct genetic engineering and is currently in the Technical University.
The industry attempts in this respect as now in the United States in Europe more and more critical scientists to influence or to discredit.
There is so little researchers, not with corporations are interlinked.
For companies critical studies published in the rule would not.
Hilbeck "The industry controls the research," said.
The hand of the stones
Uli gsell has also What concerned, a total of around 400 kilos.
It was on Monday night have stuttgarter station, the tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It schneite.
It is the same old story: in September were the excavators angerückt and had started to break off a large chunk of the nordflügels.
The stuttgarter world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against s21, having to inject billions tieferlegung of the bahnhofs.
When it came to the Settlement Freeze, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Collapsed in 6,000, 700 pieces.
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft gross stone, between 1914 and 1920, verbaut.
Gsell is bildhauer in ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a couple of slice.
"These are reliquien stones."
"They must not go away."
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft."
As he had a aufsägte, after zigarettenqualm gerochen.
What he will do with the slice, he knows not yet.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell.
The hand of the stuttgarter leads in a forest in tübingen stones on the French army, where a former munitionsdepot Manuel rongen stein-reich has built.
The 44-jährige acts with old stones.
He has all the bought on the demolition in stuttgart fell.
"It would be a shame, they would be schotter gemahlen or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a holzbüdchen that was once a wachhäuschen.
Named and have been threatened, he told him, as it was in September in the newspapers that he had bought the remnants of the nordflügels of abbruchunternehmer.
But he has been talking to the s-21-gegnern, for several days.
And he has told them that he is now but could do nothing for these are the words about.
And if there is once again was happening, then it is surely the most logical if the stones were used.
About 200 s-21-gegner, was one of the serious quader with an average of 80 kilos, and stückpreis 6,50 and 14 euros.
As a memory, but some also in the hope to be able to return him on a reconstruction.
500 tonnes of rongen had bought, 25 major truckloads.
About half the being stored in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Gartenbesitzer, landschaftsgärtner, häuslebauer.
From anywhere whether they come and weggeschleppt have what kofferraum and supporters have been able to bear.
The stuttgarter stones of the initiation have long turned into "mäuerle" or in the limits of kräuterbeeten.
"Actually is nothing special," says rongen this stone.
"would not be a political Dimension."
He is increasing in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great kingdom.
Jura he has suspended and later studied biology, then he is interested in computers and is, after all, has become steinhändler.
And steinliebhaber.
He 40000 tonnes of stones being stored.
From all over Germany, it karrt together his value.
He says that he is the biggest altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He put brakes on it.
The snow are skilful behauene sandsteine.
"They belonged to Dresden marienbrücke," he told.
Elbsandstein, amber, that he schwärmt warm.
"My lieblingsstein."
It is the way high through the forest.
He demonstrates a handful of: Red sandstein, used to be part of the karlsruher bahnhofs.
And further.
"Nice travertin."
Once included the quader to the gallery of the stuttgarter neckarstadions.
Throughout the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from the stuttgarter polizeipräsidium, rötlicher St blasien granit from the cathedral, tuff of Heilbronner hospital.
The kind of work, the effort, their sweat.
If rongen consider how the stones used by hand gehauen and with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren were quite ehrfürchtig, it will be moved forward.
"It would be a scandal if we would schreddern such a thing."
He does not become immensely rich certainly is not rich.
But 14 people in the steinhändler today, also, up steinmetze in the forest, a bildhauer, a schmied, a glasbläser and a gartenbauer settled.
"We are working very hard, but it is a good one," says the resteverwerter.
Soon he needs to Cologne.
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
Talentekampf to high-potentials
There is equipped to cope flourishing surge on buffet.
16 are students in order lachsbrötchen, tomatensuppe and süßes.
The Technical University braunschweig and of cars Volkswagen have invited the maschinenbau- and designstudenten to a workshop.
In a kind of ideenwettbewerb should they, together with vw-entwicklern on the car of the future jargon - and incidentally Volkswagen increase.
In the competition for the best brains are now many companies, as set in the nahkampf and VW, from casting on cooperation with the university.
Their mission: the most gifted students as early as possible to recruit in the hörsälen before they get to the labour market and be umworben by others.
And because the university not aufstellungen issue about the performance of their students, they are trying to tie the ausnahmetalente in praxisprojekten to spot and in itself.
On the second day of the workshops to do braunschweig refers the autokonzern about the talent.
A young lady from the pen, gummibärchen and mappen with vw-logo distributed human resources departments.
They told the hopeful jungtalenten of praktikumsprogrammen and studentenjobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico selle of the DO braunschweig care of the project with VW. from casting
He sees the benefits to both sides," the students are in contact with the industry and collect experiences."
"VW can get to know, at the same time students from casting interesting candidate closer angucken and think about who would be staff in question."
Such cooperation, selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that so aggressively to the students will gebuhlt.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical," says selle project.
The battle for the fresh graduierten will probably be even harder.
In many industries, the companies can choose their workers no longer from a large crowd of candidates.
But they must praise and specifically for highly skilled workers balzen.
Above all, graduates from the ingenieurdisziplinen are in an excellent negotiating position in this regard.
According to the Association of German engineers vdi remained in October about 40,000 ingenieurstellen are vacant.
And the so called ingenieurlücke, according to vdi-prognosen will increase.
For the wirtschaftsprüfungs- and consultant kpmg is novel dykta on the talentjagd.
He organised elaborate recruiting-events such as the kpmg-race, a kind of modern schnitzeljagd, in which the participants on the basis of gps-koordinaten need to find their way.
Eight promising students want to send the company in the next year, across the United States.
Incidentally can look at the participants kpmg-filialen and to know the company.
Who in May, will decide in two auswahlrunden in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of many candidates flies in the United States.
The they can and burning by the High potentials at the universities will be the geschütze according to dykta are growing.
"We want to be apart from the mass in the race."
"Just a simple segeltörn was not enough for us."
For talentjäger dykta seems to aufzugehen the bill.
"We have up to now contact with all the participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are in its final and want to apply soon with us," he says.
In addition to the direct court in the campus are especially of small and medium enterprises also very Classic in berufsmessen to the pirsch.
"We are trying to achieve graduates to fachmessen."
"around on the intersolar," reported sitha stübe, personalleiterin in solartechnikhersteller solarworld.
The Bonn company employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe know about the nachwuchsproblematik.
At present, advertised on the unternehmenswebsite 35,.
"It is very difficult to vakante to occupy positions."
"That takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on the uni-professoren.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities around the university in freiberg.
"The professors given indications that we can make work experience with us or its diplomarbeit letter."
Expensive werbeaktionen with the solarspezialisten are not needed.
For it with other advantages to promote the company is: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and light communication.
"That cannot offer a großkonzern often," says personalleiterin stübe.
Money is more in jobsuche far from the lead.
Flexible working hours, child care or good upward mobility were further crucial factors.
Solarworld documented in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute the 55th place among the 100 Best Employers of Germany.
The Institute produced an annual bestenliste of German employers.
It asked about IT staff how happy they are with their work and their jobumfeld and is looking to the framework for the employees.
Personalleiterin stübe advantages of the platzierung hopes in the jobsuchenden.
"I think that candidates look especially for external assessments about a potential employers," she says.
Wolf is pure kriegler from the German employer branding Academy is advising companies that with a long term strategy to build a good reputation as employers.
He advises its clients to more authenticity.
And that means, according to kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way, as employers to make attractive, is through own staff," he says.
In the branchenjargon says the internal employer branding, so arbeitgebermarkenbildung within its own employees.
"satisfied staff are the best Ambassador."
If we do unto his people are well and they identify with the company, they would completely from only with friends and known for their employers promote.
"This is like a game with gang," kriegler says.
Obama stop New ölbohrungen
Off the coast of the us-bundesstaats Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new ölbohrungen in the coming years.
The Government in Washington issued a similar ban - and so finally revoked their earlier plans.
Also remain above the Atlantic Coast new bohrungen banned for now.
This Interior Minister Ken excused Salazar on Wednesday said.
The catalyst for the strict ban, at least for the next five years, the explosion of bohrplattform should apply," deepwater horizon "in April.
Eleven workers lost their lives before the accident, and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama under pressure from the opposition and the industry had signaled its readiness to allow new bohrungen in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spills in the Gulf, is still not to come back to.
At the heart of the criticism, the energiekonzern BP of Britain, which is faced with milliardenforderungen.
A commission of inquiry in Obama's mission is to present in the course of the dezembers its results.
In October, Interior Minister Ken excused Salazar had lifted the bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
At the end have had several oil companies are immediately applications for new bohrvorhaben asked.
Stricter inspections and stricter safety regulations Obama and excused Salazar seeking to exclude a new disaster.
At the moment it is the competent supervisory authority after many of the corruption charges was discredited in the eyes, radically reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced to lucrative steuerschlupflöcher for the oil and gaskonzerne to close.
The industry warns now publicly before, that the fördermenge in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be much lower than in the past.
"The plans of the government are the largest barrier for the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent branchenumfrage by the association of consultants bdo - Before the bohrverbot of Wednesday.
The American energy alliance also complained to the insecurity in the industry: "No one knows what exactly with the regulation will change."
That investments in new projects would be postponed until further notice. At the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned off
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it, in the tankstelle: billion litres of ausgelaufenes crude oil have nature in the Nigerian ogoniland destroyed.
The people living on theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen.
Celestine akpobari believes it is a good thing.
"DO NOT BE has hit from," the ökoaktivist reassured the journalists: "You are still enough oil in the linse wars."
The 37-jährige Nigerians has monitored the attempt, a watenden young in water to the chest with the schlieren around him abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene of almost function.
That Brown rohölschwaden tops under the surface, is not to be seen.
Earlier have told you eimerweise shrimps gathered here, esther badom on the shores of the bodo-jetty-flusses.
But now is the lazy fluid waters completely dead.
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung quantities of crude oil in the huge river wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen bodo must now six hours row, to get to fischhaltige waters: that at the heart of the nigerdeltas to ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the trip by the flussläufen durchzogenen mangrovensümpfe is the full extent of the verheerung striking.
Instead of helles water wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe, into the water, its hands of who ölige fingers of humanity.
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen out of the ground, they can occasionally involved palmen their wedel hanging.
Vogelschwärme, as you are common in wetlands otherwise, is in vain: as soon as the außenborder remains silent is spreading in which, as a tankstelle sweep former paradise gespenstische calm.
"What is happening here is environmental warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy, "We are living in constant danger to the health."
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate.
The siedlungsgebiet of ogoni is a akin to disputed battlefield for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, organized here in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken saro-wiwa the first resistance, the shell-konzern 1993 has had to cease its production here, because it was too dangerous for its ölarbeiter.
Still denied today the company is the return to ogoniland, while from the whole of deltaregion Of the Triple size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 bohrquellen and 700 kilometres rohrleitungen pumped more than two million barrels a day of the black gold are the oil fields in the ogoniland, to the company have the situation is unstable.
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne gestelle as bizarre skulpturen out of the water," christbäumchen "are the heads of the bohrlöcher far too zärtlich mentioned.
They are up to 50 years old, the most korrodiert to the core.
Again and again breche such a bohrkopf apart, says akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water.
After more than two billion litres of are gone into the ecosystem of the delta expertenschätzungen in 50 years, like you, year after year the quantity of oil, in the accident of the supertankers "Exxon valdez '21 years ago into the sea before been Alaska drive - one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for were the continuing ultimate environmental catastrophe, that will be fought.
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl power, are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as main causes.
In Nigeria, shell develop far lower standards than usual else in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard, Steiner, the corporation in 2008: only the rate of defects in the pipes, was "to much higher than anywhere else."
In a place of from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte werkstatt looks in open air, there are from to make the mangroven: they are splitternackt and up to the neck ölverschmiert.
In one of the many of the fässer partly linked to röhren, partly arbitrarily scattered around are on site to identify, flackert a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie.
In the barrels of HEATED FOR several hours, the crude oil on the fire, said Michael, the leader of the group.
First insist petrol by the pipes in the auffangtopf, later tröpfelt issued at the end of the leadership finally, kerosene and diesel.
So produce Michael and four employees up to four fässer daily à 300 litres of diesel: "This brings us 34.000 naira A" - around 22 dollars.
The deltabewohner use the chronic treibstoffknappheit, in the biggest erdölstaat schwarzafrikas.
Nigeria has a single refinery.
The with less than 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculous low dieselpreis the illegal kocher can undercut: because their raw material, they get free.
It comes from "bunkerern," which are the pipelinenetz across ogoniland tap: this will leave the country, according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day.
Only a very small part of the zwischengelagerten provisionally raw material will, however, illegal veredelt: to fill the lion's share organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior soldiers belong to tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental disaster rather due to the umtrieben the population or lax production, considers that the activist akpobari for purely academic.
"The oil companies would not perceived as invaders and they would have the life of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage theft and illegal refineries."
Now is the ratio of ogoni, above all, to shell and destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group's question would be: 'may ask, of course, other nationalities as the Chinese as a better result."
This is Michael nervous.
"high time for her to disappear," says the muskulöse ölmann.
"Every minute, may be the soldiers."
Be caught the illegal ölveredler from the special forces, they are not arrest, but I think a painful schmiergeld.
Also the soldiers want originating mainly from the North, as all Nigerians, of the benefit of raw material.
"This downright stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," akpobari says.
Researchers discover dangerous baufehler in a380-triebwerken
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered in the investigation of a notgelandeten aircraft a possible baufehler, which could lead to a "catastrophic triebwerksausfall."
The airline qantas now wishes to the motorenhersteller of Justice.
The passengers of the notgelandeten qantas-airbus appears to be much more luck than at the beginning of November had so far known: the Australian luftsicherheitsbehörde has seen a major security problem in the triebwerken some of a380-maschinen in their investigation, and warns against a possible baufehler now.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in a ölschlauchverbindung he could ermüdungsrisse and produce a leak, it said in a statement published on this Thursday atsb the Authority.
This would have to "a katastrophalem triebwerksausfall can cause."
A380-reihe have been affected triebwerke produced by rolls-royce in 20 aircraft.
Including the qantas-airbus is, on the fourth of November in Singapore had to notlanden.
The Australian airline has now started legal proceedings against the British turbinenhersteller.
They tabled a klagebegründung in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allow him more legal actions against the companies.
Qantas-chef Alan Joyce said his airline will demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire on the motors had been solved, and share the wings damaged.
Rolls-royce made a ölbrand as the reason for the damage.
After the incident must now be up to 40 triebwerke replaced worldwide.
The Australian researchers announced that further sicherheitstests to carry out the superjumbos, which are equipped with the triebwerken concerned.
The sicherheitsempfehlung was the result of cooperation with rolls-royce, said atsb-sprecher Martin dolan.
The security problem has been thought to be sufficiently important, in order to inform all concerned.
After the notlandung the qantas-maschine, the airline kept its a380-flotte weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines was about three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa changed at an A380 as a precaution, the triebwerk.
The doppelstöckige flieger is the world's largest passagierflugzeug.

The German Bank wants to be separated from her wahrzeichen: according to a zeitungsbericht is seeking the geldhaus buyers for the two bürotürme its Frankfurt headquarters.

Thousands of grieve for dead mate
More than 10,000 people have in New Zealand after several explosions in a mine thought the buried miners, who were declared dead in.
Still could not be recovered the bodies, because of the security situation in the unglücksschacht remains precarious.
Barely two weeks ago, it was in the pike River mine near the town of greymouth reached a severe explosion.
29 bergarbeiter between the ages of 17 and 62 years old were buried under days.
A sonde was in the unglücksschacht hinabgelassen, but no sign of survivors had been discovered.
By virtue of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions could not rettungskräfte for security reasons hinabsteigen.
After the second heavy detonation gave the authorities and experts expected that there were no longer any chance of survival for the buddy.
The bodies have not been recovered.
Now have relatives and friends with a commemoration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered at radioactive sonnenschein in greymouth on the New Zealand südinsel.
You remained silent for two minutes.
In honour of the buried miners were 29 tische drawn up, on which helme light bulbs and the names of the mate were to see.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes, and surfbretter, found its place here.
Before the country's regierungsgebäuden wehten flags on halbmast.

To hell, warriors.
Does splatter suit the kunstkino?
The director Nicolas winding refn lotet to his kämpfer-epos walhalla rising "old genre-grenzen new."
To which public May the Danish director Nicolas winding refn have thought that as he has "walhalla rising" films?
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye - mads mikkelsen - freed themselves from his peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers by the dozen of his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like to the gedärme rough and Its Enemies already tötungsmethoden served time from the living is breaking limb, if he has bad humour.
On the other hand, einauge says as he actually is known, the whole film about not a word, and the other characters can be time to one or at most two sentences or a few painful todesschreien carried away.
Otherwise, remained silent and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of Scotland geschwelgt, which offers the wikingerwelt of around a thousand years ago the scene.
Ideal for adults cineasten with interest rather for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten.
Nice if a film several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive.
Director winding refn is since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses stoisch is his works with a little more humor the mainstream, or a little less brutality available to make the arthouse.
Most of the kunstkino-freunde should spritzenden around by the gehirnmasse and the gedärmen meant to deter them.
The action-fans, at least we will die before boredom, if einauge free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem, aufbricht trapped and an eternity in slump and fog, it seems, before the team arrives in America and there continue to remain silent.
No wonder, then, that "walhalla rising" in Germany had not found a kino-verleih and is now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images jammer, but also because, hiding behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, one that deserves some attention.
In this film is not about dialogues, or a stringent act, it is all feeling, a filmgewordener fiebertraum.
And from which there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn gönnt him very little in the moment of relaxation and undertakes him with its icy pictures and dark trance-artigen the throat to soundtrack very slowly, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred of him from the heart of the players runs.
Only a small blonder young, the side of the faithful to einauge is such a thing as innocence, retains, all the others will be driven by anger.
The vast majority of the einäugige hero, whose motives never said, but for the enemy and temporarily allies will at some point to the warriors from the hell is that it might be the Ambassador of the devil himself.
It means spoil, but perhaps only for the verdorbenen anyway.
"walhalla rising" is a more puzzling film, we hate and can admire, for upset, worked up and be surprised.
An experience.
Puzzling erdarbeiten
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country, refuses to comment on that, nor does it controls.
Launched against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli f-15 I fighter planes of a mysteriöses würfelförmiges buildings in Syria.
There lie is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 miles away, is dair as-saur.
Its name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA - when it comes to the reactor, the Syria said to have built with aid from North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley, which the electricity does not have.
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA from 2008, would be the end of April, under the name of the Middle ortschaft el-kibar have been geläufige reactor is a good way to produce plutonium - from which could build nuclear weapons.
Is the technology from the fifties are not against for other purposes.
The CIA conducted a videopräsentation before with unscharfen satellitenbildern.
By computeranimation blendete you, where the components of the reactor fell before the destruction due to be have been the copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum was yongbyon.
Also, it presented photos that show the building from the vicinity, or even the innenraum.
The reactor is just stood in front of the opening, it said, but still not have been with brennstäben apply.
Now, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known as it was then, the mystery have been increasing rather in time.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria is in el-kibar a reactor was built, but saw little evidence that there was "an active's nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some geheimdienstler In Europe there is cautious and preferred to talk only of a "Alleged reactor," even if you believe the cia-präsentation for "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how safe it is to have a reactor in front of them, said a high un-diplomat only briefly in the summer, the IAEA have "enough material in order to ask questions."
The rubble of supposed "lost militärgebäudes" created the Syrians in a hurry to one side and planierten the site thoroughly.
However, iaea-team took place in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar trace amounts of uranium, which was made by people.
Also received the IAEA on a Member State satellite commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which might be stronger than the presented by the CIA.
To get these recordings on the market are not, however, because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively.
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that never operated a clandestine nuclear program or to have built a reactor.
The uranium come by the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
But the, the IAEA according to analysis of the particles as unlikely back.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, just like on the satellite.
Also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ashes of the zerbombten building.
But Israel, too, is adamant.
"We will never comment on that," confirmed recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position.
So the investigation of the case since June 2008 schleppt out fruitless and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a high Western diplomat on the IAEA headquarters in Vienna for - it is a serious violation of the NPT in the room, watching over the the IAEA.
As a key to making progress on the information, the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, the need to be "in functional link" with the alleged reactor - and in a different way than this still exist.
In doing so, the UN weapons inspectors have not yet disclosed to the facilities that are involved, or what role they have or what they are suspicious can.
According to information provided by the süddeutschen newspaper they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah calls, in turn, derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington - isis - has identified these places and on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf tracked down, where it is most probably is one of the suspicious objects.
It is probably in or directly next to a base - just with Syria denied that argument the IAEA access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians who feared a fishing expedition, it states that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the United States so as militäranlagen auszuspähen.
Since the nukleardetektive were by a tipp of us-geheimdienste become aware of the institutions.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellitenfotos that lie between the three places and the quader on Euphrates material back and was moved.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the sites "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion" could stand.
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are needed to build nuclear weapons.
The reaktortyp will be pursued with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where it will have on the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these key issues, there are at most plausible conjecture.
What is also unclear is whether pieces of debris that could be the valuable traces Mountains have been stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappear from the ground, no one wants to have any information as to where the remaining rubble.
Which is only a few kilometres from el-kibar lie on the other side of the Euphrates to salzmine al-tibni, the Syria in 1998 on their competence as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely.
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor.
Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria is undertaking in the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large container distant, after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicions.
It is also in diplomatenkreisen, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to respect any militärgeheimnisse - alone shows how large the interest of the inspectors is the effort.
Damascus, however, bügelte this proposal as well.
Western diplomats in Vienna have had a year ago contained the reactor is destroyed, therefore have no high sense of urgency, brings about the matter us-botschafter Glyn Davies' sonder-inspektionen comes in for a few months, one of the strongest possible means, the Vienna atombehörde has to enforce controls.
Iaea-chef yukiya amano that inspections should propose that has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but he still is spoken.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand it needs to ensure a majority in the gouverneursrat of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries are represented there anything other than keen on an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in a time of war
Since angelina jolie in the summer, with the work on her still nameless regiedebüt has begun, there is trouble.
The scenario has you have written, a liebesgeschichte between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man.
Not much more we know about, but even that will be enough for concern.
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges, in their Serbian rapists.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately planned drehtage in Sarajevo, and some have been transferred to Hungary in the short term.
The film marginalised in Hungary and has now, in the postproduktion, but there will still be protested in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic by the Organisation of female casualties on the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR wrote to jolie and was seeking a meeting with the actress, has now a Bosnian newspaper reported, jolie is even Ambassador of un-flüchtlingshilfswerks.
Diplomatic, it is not, it has offered the women only weeks before a meeting in Hungary, but what the rejected.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, hasecic.
Liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps there have not been, and jolies attitude towards the victims will their enough about the scenario.
According to the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk, her organization has recommended that jolie as Ambassador to be released, The Guardian reported.
What, exactly, but has jolie for scenes written?
The Bosnian kulturministerium it scenario to read, after some up and has since granted a drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why jolie then, nevertheless, was not.
The jungautorin even claimed that they has no political intentions with your film, is said to be with a lot of trouble in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated, wanted to show the terrible consequences of war and all parties involved give a voice.
But it is vague the content.
So I have a second synopsis with film on the network, which then but rather different sounds: the loving knew that even before kriegsausbruch and meet again when they abducted, a Bosnian Muslim, in a Serbian camp will, in which he will work as a wake up.
What "sounds YES but far different from the way victims of rape verknallt in folterknecht."
That jolies film actually even before the war begins, that much is safe.
The pressure on you, jolie, was "unfair and process is based on misinformation."
Now she can only be nor the hackers of Hollywood peace: by the scenario, as has so many before they make, illegally put on the network.
Nothing like way here
On this evening is finally again right around for the Irish.
No trace of betrübnis.

The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than that of the United States.
At these results, the latinobarómetro-umfrage, carried out in 18 countries and exclusively in The Economist has been published.
This poll will be held regularly since 1995 and shows that the meinungswechsel in this region.
Fall two facts in this year's survey in September and October particularly in's eye.
First of all the good mood in Latin America
And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has increased greatly - S. Table 1 - the Democratic Movement.
In Peru, for instance, where the economy grows by around 6 percent each year since 2002, the number of demokratiebefürworter rose from 40% in the year 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy recover for the sharp drop in the last year, is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average -. diagramm 2 -.
Some 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. That is much as in the last year, but 25% - diagramm 3 - more than in the year 2001.
Some 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both figures are those of last year, but show a sharp increase in comparison with 2003 - 17% and 24% -.
A decade ago undermined Latin America's economic crisis the efforts to achieve more democracy.
That lasted during the Great Depression, this is probably due to the fact that the countries of Latin America saw only a brief rezessionsphase and a speedy recovery.
In addition, the poor by a stronger sozialnetz instead.
- according to reports of the un-wirtschaftskommission for Latin America by 2009 armutsrate in Latin America only slightly rose this week and has fallen by 32% in again this year. -
But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede -. diagramm 4 -.
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken.
Mount was in Mexico and Central America, where the recession and heinous crimes have increased, it is less the case.
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many asked in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than in the unemployment -. diagramm 5 -.
Around 31% to say that either themselves or a family member last year have been victims of a crime. but to reach 38% in the last year, dropped to the values and thus was the lowest since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the Greater support of the private and the market economy: around 71% of those surveyed überregional said that the private sector is vital for the development, there were 56% in the year 2007 -. diagramm 6 -.
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the surveyed in Venezuela this view - and 80% are in favour of a private sector - maintained, although their left president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized.
Brazil has according to 19% of the surveyed - 18% in the last year - the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States - 9%, unchanged since last year - and Venezuela - 9% in comparison with 11% last year -.
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, but this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua will be followed by Venezuela.
A wahlschlappe
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts, the fears of the polling stations, the aid to the troubled country eilten, by far.
's votes, wahlscheine overcrowded ballot boxes, on a number of occasions in the rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened stundenlanger late.
Many Haitians, many of which had become displaced by the earthquake in January, streiften umher in search of a choice.
Some fired, after all, is on.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged the country, as a result of alleged fraud demanded the lifting of the election results.
Across the country, there was some violent protests.
However, Edmund mulet, the head of the UN Mission in Haiti, the election "as quite well in many aspects."
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the caribbean Community "make these irregularities, they may be so serious, the process does not necessarily not valid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The wahlbehörde that supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, is to Jewish célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected stichwahl is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap-musiker Michel martelly and the former first-lady mirlande manigat, have withdrawn their initial ungültigkeitsklage.
If Jewish célestin, of the voters will have little or no backing, the wahlberhörde declared the winner of stichwahl, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera-epidemie and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, was a low turnout fears.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organisation.
Shortly before wahlbeginn, nearly 250, 000 cards are needed for election, were not distributed yet.
There is a great deal at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti's government.
The Haitians themselves are the same view.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández emerged a wave of sympathy that their beliebtheitsrate shoot upwards to more than 50% by 20 points. This is the highest level since its election in 2007.
Whether it to be a reelection next year will, however, depend on whether or not the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife, drew the economic policy, often budgets to are not fully take into account the tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the präsidentenpaar to spend the extraeinnahmen after its own views.
On paper, the fernández-regierung lost the majority in Congress in the last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack leading to further zerwürfnissen on October 27.
Some dissidents in the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings - in which a parliamentarian another in the face, and others, the government proposed the bribery bezichtigten - managed the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss this matter," the president.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President still has more opportunity to spend money to its own views.
The economy is hot: Probably it will increase by up to 9% in this year.
The official rate of inflation is z.z. 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions, are driving the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the post in 2003 when Argentina was ridden with economic crises, said to his main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung growth and poverty reduction.
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, singled out for the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and Census indec, which then the official inflationsstatistiken schönte.
Fernández can take a mäßigeren route now?
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements should be limited to 18% wage increases in the next year.
The high prices in Argentina's agricultural products have been a strong boost the economy.
But the inflation undermined the wachstumsschub by a great devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández For this reason, Argentina finanzwirtschaftlich probably wants to return to join in the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government is an agreement with wertpapierinhabern, which had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001.
Now appears Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to press, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as usual, always rejected elsewhere.
But last month, the economy minister amado boudou, announced that the Fund in the drafting of a new national index of consumer prices will make "technical assistance." It seems that this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the indec.
It is not known whether Fernández after ending its term of office, even without the support of her husband will be politically active.
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, most of which have enough from the kirchnerismus.
If the Argentines in March from their return to their summer holidays, will be the wave of sympatie, which has been shown to their abgeebbt.
If they win another election, they must decide whether they would like to many of her husband's political decisions quietly are lifted.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are coming to slow a closer link to the mainland.
What is Taiwan from its big brother across the straits?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible on, in order to choose the five Kardzhali mayor and councillors. This will be seen as a broad assessment of the President Ma ying-jeou.
Through the building groundbreaking business ties, einschl. of a partial free trade agreement, ma itself is a symbolfigur for the relations with the mainland. His policy, the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949 lasting changes.
Ma has passed the tests, but only just.
Even though his kuomintang-partei - KMT - three of the five mayor is, it received no majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party - DPP -, which received a more supports independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would mean that for MA problems.
Since his election two years ago, the support of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even in the councillors together with the KMT.
During the election, there was the usual events such as lastwagenkonvois with krawallmachern in Taiwan, flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and only sparsely clad tänzerinnen.
There were even the compulsory, mysterious mordversuch.
Sean lien, the son of lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT made a speech to a kmt-kandidaten, on the eve of the election
Lap when a man from the great deal of him in the eye. lien has been wounded and killed a umstehender spectators.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter lien killing or wanted to put an end to a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack, according to tsai has ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election affected and the DPP, which ended up in a bad light of the KMT has brought more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign.
Remarkably, was not addressed the relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese people love their de facto independence, and reject China's militärbedrohung.
For this reason, the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing do not like to the fore.
But this time also avoided the DPP, the anti-chinesischen feelings to stir up too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive.
Ma, for its part, wants to confirm, however, that the majority of the Taiwanese supported his policy towards China.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, zurückzulocken Taiwan with economic incentives in the community.
China sent immediately a negotiators to Taipei to prepare for a summit to investment and medical cooperation.
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first.
It is so that better until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has now reinvented.
Two years ago it was greatly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008, he strongly for the complete independence.
But under tais regentschaft has become a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the vote of working and the youth.
Tsai took place as präsidentschaftskandidatin the DPP much support, as Su tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party, now has done everything in order to show that they are in a position to do that, to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as kontaktpunkt between the DPP and China. However, this requires vorurteilsfreie discussions.
Tsai declared publicly that their party is a "trustworthy alternative" offer to Ma's vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
He said from his cell, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He urged the pragmatists su even to give up on the präsidentschaftskandidatur.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates.
The KMT will have to make a own selbstanalyse.
Ma's values are poorly, despite the rapid economic growth, but the kmt-kandidaten wanted to lead their campaigns without him.
The main reasons for his unbeliebtheit unemployment and the always seem to be further gap between rich and poor.
According to testimony of a kmt-sprechers is he going to reshape his cabinet as well as the local institutions.
A strong voice for the DPP supports Taiwan suggests that a rapprochement, if only restricted.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China, as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent kolumnisten," there is no going back."

Arsen-resistente mikrobe could allow new forms of life on the Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, including of arsenic can live, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth, and elsewhere.
Although this breakout bakterium here in the world's scientists discovered in their view, it is a sign that a life without the deemed vital elements is possible so far.
"This body has two options."
"Either phosphorus or arsenic he needs to grow."
This makes it into something very special," even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life," said Paul c.w. based Davies of the Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the journal Science.
So far, there have been six main elements are seen as vital - carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists herausfanden, increases the bakterium in California mono lake then, too, even further when it has replaced by arsenic.
"But as we wonder, what else is still possible," said the report's co-autor based Ariel that anbar from the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, as scientists need to live and see its forms, anbar.
The study is concerned with microbes that have been found in the world.
The announcement of a press conference to the discovery, in which no details were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life might be.
This is not the case.
The discovery of "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms can set in motion with the help of other elements biochemical processes and that the 'standardelemente' that, in our opinion, are absolutely essential, do not necessarily see set," said Charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the teams of researchers.
"This work is something new, because it shows that an element in basic biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," cockell added.
The discovery was not accidental.
Felisa wolfe-simon by the astrobiologischen Institute NASA, which led the study, chose the mono lake because of the high arsengehalts.
As arsenic and phosphorus chemical same, he took them to that microbes, both are exposed to, possibly even can replace an element by the other.
"The giftigkeit of arsens is first and foremost is that there is a chemically similar as phosphorus."
"By the organisms are finding it hard to distinguish an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different than phosphorus. It comes in the biochemisches system, where it almost everything verschmiert," anbar says.
The researchers, the bakterium gfaj-1 a rise in arsenkonzentration. It fit and grew.
Phosphorus better, but that they are also the mikrobe is growing in arsenic can survive, shows that a arsen-basierte way of living can happen, of course, either in the earth or on a different planet or moon on the arsenic frequently occurs.
According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for mikrobiologie at the University of Florida, the idea is that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. but so far, there was still no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more frequently, she says, That is why the science to expected that early life have used it.
"There is reason to believe that life also can have developed different than in the early erdzeitalter," forster, which is not a member in wolfe-simons was forschungsteam.
The research were supported by the NASA, the energieministerium and the national health authorities.

Police activities in China are soft
As a ausbildungsoffizier step tang shenbin through an urban square, revised with its nervous subordinates and placed in military authority and gedämpfter voice orders.
He wanted to see his female members of the chengguan - China's robust wächtern of urban order, feared and contempt for their arbitrary raids that impressed and their propensity for violence - the spectators.
"Are!"
"Look in front."
"Just goes to show you," he flüsterte them, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, very little in the teenager-alter grow out, with white handschuhen and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were closed.
Four pairs of black pumps were in gerader number.
Four proper hats were perfect with blau-weiß gestreiften held with hair.
"For me, you see an average from Mr tang contempt," acknowledged.
"models are nice."
Several governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's stadtinspektoren.
In a city of all new applicants must have a achieve tertiary qualifications.
The Guangdong province, instead of the graugrünen a leuchtend blue uniform.
Wuhan in mittel-china, violence by niederstarren, 2009, according to umkreisten reports 50 officials not properly imbisswagen and starrten set the operators until this after half an hour einpackte and left the place.
Xindu, a stadtbezirk in chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, wants to change the image radically.
Since 2003, 13 women enhance the city polizeistreifen. They were selected special because of their aussehens, their good character and their youth.
They should give a weicheren femininen aspect to the grobschlächtigen police.
But unfortunately there would also be scarlett johansson little hope, the bad image that the Chinese of these stadtkommandos have to improve.
With the right, so the critics.
Unlike the police these officials must enforce the urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008 beat to death for officials in the province of hubei a viewers, as the latter with his mobile phone filming, as a protest against a dustbin niederschlugen.
Last year, a schulungshandbuch of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It has described as criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.
In this year suffered a Shanghai wassermelonenhändler after a handgemenge with five officials gehirnverletzungen.
A from violence strotzendes videospiel that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in an attack on straßenhändler in China.
"chengguan power of the government fear," lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, to seek more controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate.
When the distrik sought in October by display eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing evening news asked the question of whether the women had real part, or only should serve as a optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to stellenanzeige were women between the ages of 18 and 22, with good character and "harmonious gesichtszügen" being sought.
They should be stronger than average large - on 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 customs.
The job of 26 lebensjahres achieve ends with.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 physically hard work.
"The most important thing is their image," was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, first depends on its external phenomenon, such as size, weight, gesichtszüge, and so on."
Will come temperament and "internal qualities."
"Female chengguan are like blumenvasen," he said and added, "In addition, however they still have other duties."
Zheng lihua, deputy head of the municipal council of the distrikts, would not agree with this description,
, but admitted that in China größenvorgaben in stellenanzeigen for both gender are not unusual.
The same is true for a steady gesichtszüge.
Whether this is tantamount to look good, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical detects corruption need not to apply.
"We can use, unfortunately, no lahmen or buckligen here," Mr Zheng.
"Its image would not be good."
Liu Yi, which is on the baoguang-platz close to a monastery of patroliert, 22, has apfelbäckchen and a well geformten mouths.
They empfindetes not as a sexist, that is placed great importance on their appearance.
"You find, I see in this uniform of sexy?" asks you with ironischem attention.
Her with the grübchen colleague, the 21-jährige Xu Yang, noted," We have the responsibility to represent, the image of the city."
According to their, do not regret the short attitude because they had more ambitious karrierepläne than simply traders scheuchen lost by the alleys, in order to prevent them on geschäftemachen.
Every morning, the streife deal with some 12 straßenhändler trying to as many as possible on foot or on the bicycle bread roll and to sell tofugerichte, before they are fortgejagt.
"Mr Wang, they disappear here, please."
"We have given them that has often said," frl said. Xu was a traders, fled on foot and in so doing his on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche had temporarily left out in the cold.
According to the women officials is the activity repeating monotonously rather than hard work.
"It almost every day is the same," said Huang jing, 20, who studied in the leisure vertriebswesen.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials, as their male colleagues, the dealers were not allowed to confiscate.
They criminals can only to threaten to report their male superiors.
That is supposed to protect them from public hostility, which are often exposed to officials in China.
Rioted outside hundreds of inhabitants of kunming during this year, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour kursierte chengguan-beamte had killed a traders.
More than a dozen police officers and chenguan-beamte were injured in the night of the incident, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge or undermined have been set on fire.
Xindu left untouched by such gewaltausschreitungen so far.
But unrest are not carried out.
Just two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz, the female official in this morning patroulierten, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had a use them seized the contrary to the rules on the pavement instead of in a werkstatt has been repaired.
The owner said zeter and mordio.
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten the officials with grimmigem face the path to their cars and went on with the use them and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male streife, he was back. It was his white namensschild, in order to remain anonymous.
As their colleagues to play the coordinators - men over 40 - purely a supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"But also often physically," says Mr Li austere.
"Most of the time people are starting with the dispute."
Senator ensign Public Prosecutor will not accusations
Prosecutors, the Ministry of Justice, Senator John ensign acquitted of the charges which, in his affaire with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to win a lobbying her husband, have been raised against him, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday were known.
This decision put an end to the most serious rechtsvorwurf against Senator ensign, the Republican from nevada. Until the scandal, a setback left the country for headlines, and his career, he was seen as a possible presidential candidate of Republicans for 2012.
As Senator ensigns Office announced, he was pleased with the verdict after a year of investigation "high."
The ethikkomitee of the Senate, however, could impose a disziplarstrafe.
According to the ensigns lawyers that they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator ensign have been cancelled and that further charges are not available in this matter.
The Justice Ministry wanted to speak about the case not.
The ruling was a surprise for many ethik-anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion that there was sufficient evidence that ensign has ignored the lobbying-verbot.
Interviews for the first time, emails and other documents, which were made public in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the suspicion that ensign Douglas hampton, one of its aid workers, helped to lucrative contracts to his silence on a affaire with hamptons wife cynthia to buy.
Cynthia hampton was during an election campaign ensigns act as a schatzmeisterin.
Ensign made contact with some political friends to, to give hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations took it after the end of hamptons lobbying for them.
As hampton recently in ensigns was wahlteam, it was he not lobbying for a year was allowed to assume responsibility for his former employers or the whole of the Senate.
According to statement of ethik-experten into the unusual agreement between ensign were friends and hampton which, before the affaire closely, known as against the ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie.
Under the published circumstantial evidence "Is this what it seems to be an agreement that has been reached and the violation of the drehtür-statuten," Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer, which has specialised in the defence of clients, which are in their sights of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice that it officially rejected, the reasons for the decision, said Mr fire to announce in the ensign-fall very careful notes and other ethikanwälten, the Department in political accusations to include a large number of failures, which were followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year that the charges against the former senator ted stevens because of irregularities to drop on the part of the public prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously schreckhaft," said melanie sloan, the leader of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington" - an organisation whose aim is the fight against corruption in parliamentary and government circles of the United States, stated a group of lawyers, the various accusations against Mr ensign has brought before the court.
"This means that hochstehende government officials now in general, be able to assume that the law did not apply to them," they added.
Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger what Mr ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had received a telefonanruf of a Public Prosecutor and another the next day, in which he has been told that no complaints against his clients will raise the Ministry.
Mr ensigns defenders had cooperate with the public prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated once again, has "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr coggins rejected it, the legal arguments that he had put forward to the public prosecutors to explain more closely.
"I am not aware of this, in the gesprächsdetails between the Ministry of Justice and I only to go. As far as I was saying: we believe to have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided to suspend the investigation because of a separate complaint by the Group on Ethics, according to which a payment of $96,000 of Mr ensigns parents have to abide by the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence given that the money would have been something else as a gift.
NV Energy, a major company in nevada, supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr hampton thanks to the help of Mr ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place.
An email from December 2008 shows that, after the company has moved Mr hampton as a lobbyist forward, Mr ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a talk with Mr hampton in which he informed him that he was the Interior Minister because of a cause," anklopfe."
Mr ensign was also with Mr hampton and another agreed customers from nevada, allegiant air, for lunch and asked the minister of transport to agree to a meeting on behalf of the airline, when that Mr hampton had stopped for the purpose of lobbying.
Than last year for the first time information on this affair, to apologize to the public Mr ensign with its voters and gave its position in the Senate, where he had been in the order of Republicans in fourth place.
After he was no longer have noticed many months, told Mr ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he envisage a third term in the Senate.
In an announcement that Mr ensign no longer be the aim of police investigation, said his pressesprecherin, jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that to give very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigation einstelle.
"Senator ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in nevada," she said.
Cheshire-berufung calls attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the court path.
In the minutentakt verschickten about Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies.
At the end, so the defense, there have been more than 140, 000 twitter-meldungen about the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the aufging on fire.
On Thursday, the process of Steven J. hayes, closely following the cheshire was accused of three members of a family, connecticut to have killed, a formal end to find, if the richterspruch has spoken out about the death sentence, which the jury, to do it.
But Mr hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in courts to explain the reasons for appeal and the courts will deal for years.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that as a result of the intensive coverage of the process, through the extensive use of twitter of durchschnittsreporter - a zirkusatmosphäre "and a" widespread, immediate penetration aufrührerischer details had come, so that the jury had been influenced by the public indignation in an improper manner.
This appeal the appelationsgerichte could lead to deal with the question of whether the new rules in the court needed to be new technologies.
"As I have seen it during this process, I believe, that there really is a danger if the entry of new technologies in the court each individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. ullman influenced, Mr hayes hauptverteidiger.
The presiding judge, jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected the applications last week by entscheid back In summary, when he said that the new media," would be carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was with safety is not the last word in this matter.
For decades, gerichtseinsprüche have ascertained that the coverage of famous cases can doubt on the fairness of the process.
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopathen from cleveland to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that lifted it because of the new media would have been a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the court,."
Some people believe that the fernsehserie and the spielfilm "on the run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that gerichtseinsprüche what Mr hayes conviction could look at half a century later, followed by the argument that new rules are necessary, for the kommunikationswege from the Court at the time of the case Dr sheppard were still inconceivable to regulate.
"There is a good reason for about the influence of the new media in processes that are pursued by the general public, to be concerned," said John J. donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, according to the death penalty in connecticut has investigated. His report, it will arbitrarily imposed.
Professor donohue said, some of appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction a prompt communications out of the court could make the processes fair.
The twitter-angelegenheit is just one of many that the lawyers of Mr hayes explain to delay for years to discuss, and therefore a conviction.
The defender, for example, claim that Mr hayes could already have been regarded with hostility under any circumstances, as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential juroren by granting them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed.
Some of the juroren said that photos of the victims, jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust.
The defenders say they would call into question the Constitution verfassungsmäßigkeit the death penalty, and argue that the judges a false juror have exchanged views, which would have been a critic of the Public Prosecutor's office, and that it is an improper manner would have exerted pressure on the ruling, when he had made the unusual decision to ask the panel to decide free over the weekend.
The juroren were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed coverage of the process is attracting perhaps the biggest interest.
In a urteilsanfechtung which they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in connecticut and during the election campaign for the position of governor and for the US Senate has been discussed by the candidates.
They argued that the new media constantly had reopened the flames of the emotions on the case.
"Such a equipped to cope daily surge of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the gerichtssaals," the lawyers wrote, "it has been previously seen in New Haven and perhaps even Nationwide has not yet."
Its focus to the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are aufwieglerischer than reports, which are reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher look is slowing, the reporting about future trials verarme.
But some lawyers said that appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical changes need the adaptation by the courts.
Mr hayers lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their appeal in relation to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new rules require new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can connect courtesy what divides us?
After a campaign of schimpfwörtern and negativität is little civility erupted in Washington this week.
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly return to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress, no breakthrough in the big issues, with one during the the "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a Government's policy, in no decisions had to be taken to deal more.
After all that is being said, it was not a polite debate between two different sides even a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns.
The President's public meeting of the defizitkommission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, can give a mutual respect, the ideological divide, which remains the members of separating, of concealment.
This is hardly enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation here.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in of one of the other sign of cooperation and calls for spirit of compromise, and we even tried to the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a resumption of parteienkriegsführung arbitration.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday were itself, and its assessment limited by the participants on a minimum level of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, to be a rapid change in the atmosphere, which has dominated over the past two years, might hope.
Regardless of whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart.
At last, the novemberwahl Washington at least mild voted for a short time.
"No question, the tone, a tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after the elections.
Elections give parteiliche passion, the die again.
And that is a good thing."
In some issues, particularly those who on the agenda of the "lame duck session" are Republicans and Democrats, no other choice than to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts, at the end of the year, and no one supports the end.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some, or even all, whether it is temporarily or permanently.
A compromise on the increased arbeitslosengelder is also expected to, if only because the Republicans cannot afford it, that people think that supported the tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to unemployed workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that it is in these issues during the "lame duck session" can ratify some while, at the same time, the new START Treaty.
But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a permanent cooperation between the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January.
Instead, he says, is a phase of nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, are done, this short psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical, and this skepticism is shared by many, leads the courtesy to real cooperation.
"I see a lot of things, what is happening as vorkampf from now on until 2012, or schattenboxen, for the hauptereignis by 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the teeparty-wählern, whose education were conducive.
How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they pokern too high, they know that they have to try to reduce their promises, the government's expenditure and to put the gesundheitsreform out of power, to be respected.
The parteilinien are already in The first reactions regarding the recommendations of the defizitkommission clearly what a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes and raising the retirement age and include the lowering of government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have taken over, according to their own assessment, so much insisted, the defizitfrage to the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 vote within the Commission, in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are fighting very, in order to come only in the vicinity of this number.
The biggest opposition is in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, at least today, only little room or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress is required.
The first battle will take place in the form of parteizusammenstößen next year, when the Republican challenge Obama in terms of staatshaushalts, taxes and of the health system, then followed by a period of more zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties are working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in, then both sides must carefully to ensure the public reaction.
Regardless of who is always doomed to lose, will have to change the course and try to find the compromise.
This may, in fact, be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization is now greater than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time the activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude for a 2012 in consequence of much larger election.
From that point of view, may the courtesy, which this week about the display will be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides, to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still be separated.
Durchgesickertes us-dokument portrayed the port of Moscow of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptokratie" and is a part of the schutzgeldes, which they einsammelt, bribes and on to the Kremlin. reported in February that the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.

He said a Russian television channels in September, when he was asked about a documentation that the suggested that he was corrupt," It is crazy, it is dreckig, it is dirty."
> an unbelievably large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys have shown.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the Ambassador, individuals are known, and It is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The government's direct link of Moscow with the crime has led to some described it as" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government seems more like a kleptokrat acts as a government," the memo.
"criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "- a term from the world of the criminal/the mafia, which means" roof "word for word or protection force, which is on the Police, State security - FSB -, the dienstaufsichtsbehörde - mvd - and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as well as in the whole of the Moscow regierungsbürokratie extend.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure in the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, mvd and the militia are on the second stage."
"least implications of the ordinären criminal AND THE CRIMINAL inspectors at the lowest level."
"This is a inkompetentes system in which the criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city no offers help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms from the police and the small business people arrested.
A source, as is," said that Moscow is geschäftsinhaber understand that it is best to get the protection of mvd and FSB - and not by organised crime -, because they have not only more weapons, resources and power as the criminal, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs no longer as asked as it used to be."
The memo pointed out that, while the collection of funds is comprehensive, not be to protect itself very modest; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested.
Do not pay the, the, find their business very quickly closed above - on the basis of one or two vorwands.
Medvedev has talked about the fighting corruption, has on several occasions but at the same time, noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men, who were with the likely with koffern, full of money, take in the Kremlin.
"in its fight against the corruption medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said georgy satarov, Director of by, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But it is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not a part of the political class, because of the political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, is estimated by the corruption Russia, will cost more than $300 billion a year.
The country is to place 154 a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the NGOs organization transparence international countries, will be of "the least corrupt - listed" to "most corrupt."
The unveiling of the memos the American Embassy, what happened after Moscow time late at night, is certain to cause offense in the Russian government, although Luzhkov, accused for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems löse.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente could be a forgery, and reacted furiously to the disclosure that American diplomats have called him batman and medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that we have to take the interaction, which is a key factor of domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this could be done with such an arrogance with such a pressure and with regard to such unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confrontation with the past
In a weak illuminated betonierten klassenraum reminded with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the anlong veng high school to the man who has built it, to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta mok.
"Everyone loves TA mok here."
"He was a good leader and he has been considering his people are," said sreng kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, known as "The schlachter ', then the commander in this remote former Rouge rouge-hochburg in northwest Cambodia's popular, where he built hospitals and bridges, which has developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still lives.
But this year, 12 years after the defeat of the Khmer Rouge to the Government, long supporters in anlong challenged veng.
In April a local truth and versöhnungsforum allowed the victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government a schulbuch, for the first time children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal the UN and Cambodia's for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former leader of the notorious Tuol are used sleng torture centres, kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the anxiety among the Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs overshadowed their efforts at reconciliation and Cambodia's reintegration into the society.
"There are still reject and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said chhang youk, head of the dokumentationszentrums of Cambodia's, an independent organisation, which studied the regime.
"For them, the Khmer Rouge's life was impressive, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is dividing even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, revision or from hunger.
When the Vietnamese, causing the pole pot-ied government in 1979, fled the remnant of the regime and its military, on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here widely used it to December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary strikes the guerrilla warfare by their base in the west of mountains and jungles of Cambodia, drew TA mok led the next generation in anlong veng approach.
But in the 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the United Nations in 1993, led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge militants began, the government joining what the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998, in 1996.
Pol Pot died in 1998, and a natural death of TA mok, who had not given in, was in the dangrek by government forces in 1999 mountains arrested.
He died in 2006 at the prison in Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial.
As their benefactors they no longer protected, fled the majority of rural Cambodia's former Khmer Rouge fighters in the zermürbende poverty and many held on to the movement in nostalgic memories.
Even if a few elite official of the Khmer Rouge retained their local government posts, because they niederlegten their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, ignorant farmers.
"These people have benefited only very little of the capitulation," said sok leang by the Center for justice and reconciliation, the throughout Cambodia, also in anlong veng, public forums,
"They are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime."
"They grew without any berufswissen to."
Sor Lim, 55 years, the 1974 had joined the rhmer Rouge as a teenager, fought in the jungle by anlang veng before he niederließ in 1998, to lead a life as poor reisbauer.
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"ta mok has given any something to eat."
"But life now is difficult, because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal also has concerns wachgerufen here.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister to put them on trial.
It is the task of the Court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, condemning, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond the four cases.
That has done little to the fears in anlong to alleviate veng.
Current medienspekulationen have focused on in the chaem, 64 years, that during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s, distriktchefin in the province of manteay had been meanchey.
In 2007, it was representative of the dokumentationszentrums of Cambodia told they have the construction of the trapeang thma damms director, a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern probably died.
On a hot evening came on the chaem of the work in the fields to their holzhaus to a dirty streets outside of anlong veng back.
As the sun casts long shadow over the desiccated grass raised more alien rejected in the chaem it, to talk about their past in the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court it flows, so it would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said.
"There would be no more prosecutions, would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the Court would be more suspicious accusations, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"A hole, Cambodia must dig and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said chhang youk from the dokumentationszentrum.
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten collect means the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to put these broken parts together, so that like Everything else can understand."
The center created the first schulbuch approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, the Democratic 75seitige 'history of Cambodia."
In June it distributed the book in anlong veng as the annex to the history book for the High School of bildungsministeriums, which contains less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge.
As so often in Cambodia know the young people in anlong veng only little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student at the anlong veng High School, said that the new schulbuch students will help to understand an important part of its history.
But his parents reacted sceptical when he brought home with the book, to read it.
"My family rejected many parts of the book, and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such a resistance that makes the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, said sok leang.
But the public forums, the schulbuch and get the court to and to influence," he said.
Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction.
Up in the dangrek mountains, a sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter route to a rechteck black soot, covered with a rostigen blechdach.
Pol Pot's body was been burnt after his death in 1998 on a reifenhaufen here.
Nuom sothea, 31 years, a handyverkäuferin on straßenrand, said she does not know a lot about the man, who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here, go to him in order to pray," she said.
It was nuom sotheas birthday and later in the day, it wanted to go to Pol Pot's last ruhestätte, where it is Bush a mature bananas for, in the hope that it brings its luck.
Belarus is no more waffenfähiges uranium anzusammeln agree,
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global securing nuclear material has the Government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton rodham with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional articles of the sicherheitsgipfels made known.
The US government had for years sought to convince, Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But the US administration official told the Washington Post that two geheimabkommen with Belarus have been taken in the last two months, to remove 187 pounds waffenfähiges uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt.
That was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the issue remains anonymous, approximately 500 pounds.
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Of the 47 nations" had excluded from April to be that of Belarus.
And it was obvious good enough to ensure the invitation for the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel - by 2012 -."
"That shows me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group to promote the nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, over a period of four years to ensure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government has six countries, helped to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear sicherheitsgipfel, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up their uranium.
"Keep as highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, what is essential waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make it dirty bombs and we will not sell it."
"We use it only for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus 1, however, a few months ago the United States than it an agreement's interest in the meeting.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the material easy was contaminated by radiation, official say.
It was in a spezialzug load, the more than 1,500 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal on, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the official.
The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money flows in the Belarussian research with depleted uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very cautious, coordinated and to build confidence," the Agreement, which was signed by Clinton, led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the energieministeriums, which is working on the global gefahrenreduzierung.
The James Martin nichtweiterzugebende Studies Centre estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Dissolve Belarus wants to be according to the common agreement camp by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, first of all because of lukashenkos harsh disregard for human rights.
However, Wednesday's statement suggested a possible rapprochement.
"The progress of these global security issues heißend welcome, the United States of America and Belarus know that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.

Party popular won 4 seats in the Congress in order to achieve this, and psc lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the pp could play a crucial role in the cities lérida, tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant stimmen- and abgeordnetenzuwachs in the last regional elections is the pp your eyes are already on the parliamentary elections - brought forward or not. your expectations are more than positive, because the votes, which the party achieved in these elections, which is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
As received the Catalan party 610.473 vote in the legislative elections in 2008, while this figure in the regional elections in the year 2006 only 316.222 fraud.
Last Sunday, the ppc reached 384.091 votes.
If these rising trend - result of the stimmenanteils diversion of psc and commitment on the part of the electorate of pp - should continue, the analysts of the project pp during the parliamentary elections that the ppc from 8 to 12 congressman could rise, while also ciu four - it now has 10 - before and the psc would lose at least 9 members - from 25 -.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for pp and psoe.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the erc a member, at present, it has three could maintain or a before - and icv their members.
However, the wahlkalender should be maintained, is the next date with the local elections in the May 2011. Then, too, can be the People's Party - pp - his tongue to tip the balance in order to put an end to the Socialist domination, and in four provinzhauptstädten emblematic and with their majority in the City Council, one of the local municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the psc the cities of Barcelona, tarragona lérida and gerona, in which the Socialists not get a majority or on its traditional allies - erc and icv - can turn, will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this Party of its mission in the local council emblematic in which they ought to be, will lose 5% of the votes.
The pp, on the other hand, recorded an increase of their stimmenanteils in the four provinzhauptstädten and could become a key force in Barcelona, lérida and tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that can play the lead in tarragonas change. There they had in the current mayor, Josep félix ballesteros, together with the pp ruled.
En lérida is the pp only 500 votes behind the psc. The mayor, àngel ros maintains good relations with mariano rajoy, during the recent election campaign, on a number of occasions.
Also in other important places, such as a significant increase in badalona castelldefels or reus has enabled the People's Party has been made.
Currently, the pp represented in 34 local municipalities of Catalonia and seeks the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
Thousands of reisepässen the Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven out of the police officers, the police geheimdienststelle emblematic arrested Pakistanis and the Nigerians constituted the run from Thailand from dschihadistische cell, the different by Al qaida-gruppen, including the "Movement for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam" - LTTE - and "laschkar e-taiba '- let - - the latter was author of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which 106 deaths, with passports supplied in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister to be of great importance, the investigation, which so far is that he assured that the "Operation kampai" had been the fälschungsapparat Al qaidas worldwide, "weakened" and "so their ability to act."
The researchers expect to be that, in the two years ago, in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports have been sent to Thailand, where these forged and then to the groups that make up the criminal galaxie Al Qaeda, have been sent to their "militants" with impunity would cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
Tendency to blame cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which has been active in Europe. Because of that apart from the Thai untersuchungsorganen, other European polizeieinheiten collaborated in the investigation. It is not unlikely that it is on the territory of the EU in the next couple of days for Similar atrocities such as the last Tuesday in Barcelona was carried out, will come from.
In coordination with this operation - the Pakistanis junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad Mohammad saddique Khan begum, tanveer arshad and the Nigerians babatunde agunbiade were arrested - was a further carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan ehsan butt as well as the thailänder sirikanlaya kijbumrung have been arrested.
They had of Bangkok from led the niedergelassene cell in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan Network, was a part of it was destroyed in the year 2009, notably steel tourists passports in accordance with the intention of what is known as the "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents in the name of men between the ages of 25 to 45 years had to be issued and would be valid several years; they were not permitted to visastempel levels.
In untersuchungskreisen in Catalonia is pointed out that so far, no links between the detainees and the attack in Mumbai, in spite of the fact that the author of this attack to be proven," laschkar e-taiba "was in Spain, one of the empfängergruppen of counterfeit passports stolen and then in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack by means of a geldtransfer-unternehmens from Catalonia had been sent out several thousand dollars, which have been in the purchase of prepaid-karten for mobile phones "invested," which later by the members of the "Commandos," that was an end to the lives of 106 people, have been used.
The police have seized an extensive documentation.

The future alliances that the regionalisten in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress, want to reply to depend on a possible Entente with the pp. The talks, which this at the moment as, however, with the rest of the parteichefs leads to Catalonia.

The altenpflegeheim reaffirmed that the deaths are not due to "lack of action"
The owner of the altenheims in olot do not rule out that their pfleger on 11 older people killed
The representatives of the altenpflegeheims la caritat in olot - gerona - gave a press conference yesterday, in which it pointed out, What harm the criminal acts, Joan vila dilmés - the pfleger, who during his work at least 11 had, for which he was responsible, killed old people, the institution had caused.
The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, by his lawyer, Joan cañada, went to court and announced," La caritat would like to denounce the leaders - for those deaths -," but "the right and our haftungspflicht oblige us to accept the process and the civil liability."
To accept the establishment of a social ansehensverlust must not only because they had the criminal acts of the pflegers not found in time, but now pay a high entschädigungssumme, which is calculated by the rechtsvertretern of the families of the victims.
Joan vila dilmé confessed that the first crime go back to August 2009 and that he murdered have since continued.
The judge ordered the exhumierung, former patients of eight bodies of altenpflegeheims - to, because he was suspected, the late personally that no doctor examined by telephone, but the formalities because of their age and disease have been phased out.
The head of the caritat verneinte this point crystal and said that "lack of adequate measures keinerzeit might have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La caritat added that "in the legal dispute there is no evidence for a person other than the accused were negligent actions."
The already getaufte confessed to the day before yesterday as "todesengel '11 murders and explained that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second to have murdered old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose insulin, as opposed to the first crime, in which he had used a mix of various palliatives.
The head of the caritat said that the access of staff to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulinspritzen and the beruhigungsmittelcocktail, the pfleger in six of the nine crimes committed, in order to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory analysis will tell whether vila is lying and for his first victims in fact, he chose a less cruel death or whether this ausbrannte from within, by showing them bleichlauge verabreichte, as he had done it according to the confession in three women, which he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat to you believe the statements made by the pflegers No, not even in terms of the number of the gestandenen murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified that vila very different had made statements in court and that there is no point would like to change his approach after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say, they made it is for this reason, and in order to clarify the scope of these incidents available to the judiciary.
The European Central Bank drohgebärden - ECB -
Yesterday the investors reacted strongly to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaktionsvermögen."

The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which in the degree to which he collapses recover, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not lose its fear for a long time to come.
Today a month ago, the European Central Bank invited us to our liquiditätmsaßnahmen to reverse that the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably has to make a number of times, taking a step backwards in the future.
The Bundesbank, called for the beendung of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. It should only be a einwöchiger of permanent access will be maintained.
After the irland-krise, we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quartalsende to ensure liquidity be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the programme to buy securities and spend a stärkendes signal will be continued.
When the expectations are not met, created the excellent response of the markets of yesterday back and if halstarrig insisted that we will withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen, only God can help us.
As well as ezb-sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed, the purchase of staatschuldpapieren do not need to be considered and the markets then collapsed, this story could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB has to be credible and persistent.
In May, it bought the teeth, and on Wednesday, she said, already much to have what they provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of a year of staatstiteln rather weak in Portugal.
To 5,28% from the State. Asset management was only 500 million, compared to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction.
But the interest rates in Portugal fall by 30 basis points in the whole curve and reflected this a wahrnehmungsveränderung of markets according to the words of Trichet's.
In Ireland, the figures from the schuldenlochs allied and Bank of Ireland. Published
The sum is estimated at around 10 million in the short term and possibility of another 15 thousand. There is time to February, in order to obtain private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has totally lost its credibility after it had failed to recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers are within the framework of the rettungsplans acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must on Tuesday given the parliamentary approval of his new budget next year. as it is still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland also continue to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has their discourse with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December moderate made. There is political unity required to show that, together, we play the same partitur.
Wagner The problem is that Germany wants to play and the other countries the ninth sinfonie Beethoven's.
Before the Spanish regierungspräsident presented yesterday the plan of action, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalization, privatization, and arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahmen. Measures, the sound like vivaldis four seasons in the ears of the investors.
The doppeleffekt Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish Stock Exchange has appreciated by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to the February was the response of the government and the Bank of Spain and convincing, and we will benefit from the überraschungseffekt quickly.
Today there is a major auction a three years of staatsanleihe, will hold the advantage of the trichet-effekt. That is why we are taking out a strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit.
A selbstaufopferung for Spain would be the applying for a hilfsplans.
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has at its disposal, three times as much as 40 billion euros in March. the interest rates are extremely expensive and terminate would without any notice of the access to the markets closed.
Nonetheless, our strategy should comply with the slogan, cäsars MRS: "Now is not the only, but also the measure."
Go to it, we can do it!

Red bull Triumphs in the f1 with a geheimwaffe of Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time.
Since red bull 2004 in the world of Formula 1 eindrang, is their history in this distinguished universe, the speed of surprises and be marked.
Initially, no one did the neuling attention to and, despite its sharply rising background during the last saisons fixed in the endspurt all last November to the victory of the ferraris of Fernando alonso.
Without the ability of the German pilot and weltmeisters sebastian vettel or the motors of Renault want is going to reduce the leistungsstärke of "geheimwaffe" that the multinational firm Siemens red bull in their hands, and this has created a siegerteam, have become a legend.
In fact, is a powerful software to simulation processes which the German company for purposes, which do not have to do with autorennen in 2007, putting on the market.
This was described as plm informatikprogramm for the development of montageketten used in factories all over the world, energiewerken and precise instruments.
Aim for a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this really is to be built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft of sukhoi and of the most famous commercial vehicles of nissan easier.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung of Siemens, said that with the use of these software in the red bull "formula 1 - factory in a few hours, almost in real time" the amendments and improvements, the design on the race and be found in the tests, and can carry out.
Russwurm leads from that in 1992 in the rennställen an average of ten technicians were working, in a season only three or four could introduce improvements.
Over 180 highly qualified young people today work in red bulls team. They lead with powerful edv-anlagen analyses and all possible changes to the rennwagen through.
The siemens-manager said that the plm-software is in a position to all parts of rennwagen of red bull to analyse and to improve, with the exception of the motors, responsible for the only Renault said.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamik and the safety elements will be changed.
The changes can thanks to advanced production facilities and hightech-autoklaven within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of simulators be transferred in the reality of the situation.
The only border this insane technical perfektionismus is set, the $40 million, a Formula 1 - team can spend on his race in a season.
Red bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen built in a remote place 50 kilometres from London.
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly from journalists - are severely circumscribed.
All what is happening there is top secret.
The workforce, covering 580 people, including the two pilots, The World Champion vettel and Mark webber.
But red bulls true Formula 1 - hero is zweifelslos the latest world champion sebastian vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources, the energy-drink-hersteller in the service of his participation in the rennstrecken is, there are other protagonists, whose support is priceless and their bekanntheit zero.
The technologichef the site, Steve nevey, said that five years ago still one could say that the progress made in the field of R&D for rennwagen by 50 percent to win contributed and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the anteilswerte changed. the technology makes 85 per cent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that vettel and webber can never be replaced by edv, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiatoren."

Sabadell wants to steal his rival in three years, a million customers "
The Managing Director of banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that for the banks will be a tough year in 2001, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and initially predicted the end of the schuldenkriegs.
Nevertheless, it is a collapse in the zinsspannen advance, the banks with increases of the charges and offset the price of loans to try.
Sabadell expected in three years to existing reached a million retail customers' - a still.
Sabadell has found the way to use the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank 2011 will introduce a new dreijahresleitplan.
The objective is not only to survive without the use of public support from the frob, but also the market share for a million retail customers, 700 000, if YOU WILL LOSE withdraws the clients, the bank - to increase. This is the great challenge before this bank, up to now, it has its geschäftskunden more attention than their users.
Earlier this year, they 250, 000 users and 50, 000 companies dollars. To
The market share in retail is 3.5%, while the geschäftskunden account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the geschäftsplans 2011-2013 is to increase productivity, read austerität, kostenreduktion. The challenges facing the Bank so that it will, together with jahresabschlussbericht imagine.
Only a few banks dare set objectives in these difficult times and to publish, as all plans of the banks have been confused by the financial crisis in the world.
Sabadell will set out in this year its four years ago leitplan conclude optima. It was initially to three years, but it was as a result of the market interpreted extended for a financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks, are the main aim of the bank.
In a breakfast stressed guardiola, organised by the apie 2011 would be a "difficult year" "With great scope."
The managers is on that Spain would only "slowly" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to be created in two or three years' work, "crucial to the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war of liabilities, the zinsmargen punished - wane, the risikozuschläge, the banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity as compensation for reduction of profit margins are already on the price to lend themselves.
"The issues of liquidity and funding are structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We don't have the Hahn marginalised, but the zinsdifferenziale are very high," was guardiola.
Banesto was already on Thursday the order of their filialnetz from the allocation of long term loans to limit and to increase the zinsdifferenziale - vgl. cinco días of 22 and 27 November -.
The managers, also a, the banks, the stategie At present," The charges to increase," but "within a framework of competition obedience."
Sabadells leitplan is based on organic growth, even if the group does not rule out, as always, corporate business.
Not for nothing, he assured that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "highly," and does not exclude the possibility that some of the Spanish financial institutions in red triggered figures decline.
He is of the opinion that the frob could replace in kaptitalaufstockungen the monetary market.
After he assured that sabadell can survive a temporary closure of the markets, it weakens the argument of some bankers, which are already a new liquidity crisis predict.
He stressed that nothing can be put in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, we can achieve short term financing of repogeschäfte and to deal with the crisis.
Ceca excludes the possibility of a second wave of mergers of Savings Banks
The Director General of the ceca, José Antonio olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday the possibility that it might come to a wave of mergers of Savings Banks and said the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
As the konzentrationsprozess of Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks to not participating in the first phase. they retained the second round.
On the other hand, assured the Director General of the Spanish sparkassenverbandes - ceca -, José Antonio olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the biggest part of the merger is completed. The inclusion of cajasol into the group banca cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it was, in fact, adjustments."
"The biggest part is completed. It may be that we have instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all of the key processes are already complete. they were of banco de españa, has strongly supported the all transactions, controls."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of the directors and managers aragoniens - adea - led olavarrieta made from that of the konzentrationsprozess' as soon as possible, and that we have to be satisfied with the after time, which expired in ancient times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with banco de españa been defined," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 thousand million vermögensbestand to 17 with the 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process. The number of financial institutions was reduced by 62 percent, and they are now very much bigger, what we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "There was a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slow pace of the trial, the unseriösität and absurdity of revealed," because "banco de españa warned us to close before the end of this year on time."
The Director General of the ceca, José Antonio olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain is one of the rigorosesten finanzierungssysteme Europe and "perhaps" all over the world and added that those who have the anzweifeltenn "without deeper knowledge of" would do.
The managers said that we are in the current wirtschaftskonjunktur "not worried" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks must make a "very important" konzentrationsprozess have gone through, the "will happen as soon as possible."
He also pointed out that the Spanish banks the stress tests, the ECB held in July, had passed very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line Germany
Berlin has opted for the beibehalt of the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension in the markets have sparked a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero put forward new adaptation measures, starting with steuerermäßigungen for small and micro, the regulation of the zeitarbeitsunternehmen or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefits concern, through to the privatization of 49 percent of aena, the management of airports barajas and El prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the Deputy regierungschefin, Mrs salgado, with the help of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible herausbeschwört have the current crisis.
How are these events to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
It is Germany a fundamental new perspective to shape our future, the clashes with the maintenance of the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of the opposition in Europe one begins in Germany to spekuliern about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: the return of the German mark - although it sounds currently more to science fiction -, supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50 percent of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. It means that more macroeconomic control and strict management; punishment of the countries that the targets; some countries möglichereweise zahlungseinstellung broken, and the extension of the cost of possible adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and saw the beginning of has for some time. This is why there are no excuses.
First 2009, as both the IMF as well as the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government will come up with a constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016.
It was the first sign of the auseinanderdriften between what Germany for necessary - Strict steuerpläne and stable public finances - and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign, the Central European country, as Merkel the decision to rescue of Greece hinausschob painful.
Back then, it was. But the fact is that severely criticized the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were totally opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel is in the last oktobertagen again with a clear position clear. It calls for a review of the agreement of the European Union, in order to allow for the rescue of a country and at the same time to hold private darlehensgeber On a bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as antieuropäisch, since they irlandkrise and the following on everything.
But her proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been approved. In the next few months, we will be on the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures as of 2013, participate.
Germany has drawn a red line, the intends not to exceed it.
Says it all that, even if unpopular measures must be taken now - from that date to the old functioning of the euro, there will be no more.
2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries will be severely punished, can be forced to do so, to explain to go bankrupt and in this case the private sector must play a part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard wachstumskurs, with high savings and investitionsraten moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade salden.
The other option, which is based on debt and construction industry with huge löchern in the balance of payments, as it has been mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad, not to understand it.
It is not just a question of the deficit by the year 2013 to three percent runterzufahren.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do is to deceive ourselves in these conditions.
Move I hope that the current turmoil in more calm.
And that we have the capability of the US will be offered, will use by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double Announcement - The promised reforms, after the meeting, with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday - points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, to create order in our own house, their way has caused.
But the Red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look so that would change anything in this.
Among the damaged options is that we take into consideration the with little serious countries fully leave gestopften euro area that should not be ruled out.
In this case, Germany still tell us, it could have warned us.
Sport and regelumgehung
Tricks, like those of alonso and Ramos in the game against the ajax show erfindungsgeist, but not the will to avoid a penalty.
The Real Madrid - xabi supposedly of two players of the alonso and Sergio Ramos - has instigated exclusion a term in the game of 23 November against the ajax in the Champions League result, that has been shed much ink about whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether any both players of the UEFA should be sanctioned.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende - their team had already clearly won - time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would give his group, the two players will meet the next ligaspiel mandatory sanction against the auxerre and embark on the next spielphase without cards.
Finally, the disziplinarkommitee the UEFA the coach of the clubs, José mourinho and the players with different amount of money involved, with two to play.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport befolgten rules.
Part of that debate about the case is to set forth suggestions that a team of the club Real Madrid - the claims in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions, his players for similar incidents had played the lead role, and it - on the dramatisierung punished by mourinho an episode has added to its long history more than theatralischer and provozierender engineers.
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes action contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. In fact, this course of action is to avoid the Statute of the sport, but whose sense seem to.
In this matter, the damage caused will lose the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sport spirit, defended the physical integrity of the counterpart, an aspect by these actions were not at risk because it was not aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefit from the gegenteam. It did not happen.
The paradox of activity of the Real Madrid player is that it does not coincide with what we usually mean by falschspiel or regelumgehung made, because the avoidance of the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be so long as possible so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players from the penalty, happily waited.
Another question is what kind of advantage the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls Drew.
It should be pointed out that the rival either in a less favourable position was still benefits for the gespielte game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that one's own team with less players had to continue to play.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have this players.
Obviously, the advantage is that the next spielphase of Champions League without the players cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game, begin.
But it is a long, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, given that the team could eventually leave. Moreover, it will the players with this kind of approach a penalty and go on in the second kartenzyklus, in which it because of kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle of retirement.
That means that it is not as clear, whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately do not against such incidents will lose the sporting spirit, belong to the strategic decisions, in order to benefit from the provisions of the broadest possible.
In this case, wanted to avoid the players not a sanction - that would be a clear case of regelumgehung real - rather, they wanted to choose when they undergo this.
It took a strategic decision to flee without a penalty to avoid or before her.
Although blur the line between imagination and regelumgebung is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of imagination.
I have the impression that the dispute has arisen as a result of two factors: because it came to two selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of provoking regelübertragung.
The damage was done, the principles of the sport by these acts, is less ethical rather than aesthetic.
Angebotoffensive the kundenfang for gruppen-weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the kalenders leaves an avalanche of this year reservierungen fall on the days 16 and 17 December.

Among the six gruppenmenüs was a weihnachtsmenü for 30 euros or more than preishit added. there is a feeling that the clients are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year, in return for more details, such as cava wish.
Also in some firms, you can see green sprossen sprießen, which is why the employees will be invited again. This gives the impression that the gruppenessen are on the rise again.
From the dachverbands fecasarm - with associations such as the kneipen-, restaurant- and freizeitverband of Barcelona, stated the Deputy Chairman, enric familiar gomà, which we need to see the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservierungen as a whole are right "lively," although the customers' a maximum herausschlagen.

In addition, it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations sexual abuse, which the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark stephens," the police knew where and how they could make contact with Mr assange."
The international police office based in Lyon was already on 20 - France - at the request of Sweden the order from, but it was until yesterday after receiving power by the Swedish authorities have not made known.
As the issue is. The 188 interpol-länder need to identify and locate assange," to be temporarily to arrest and hand over it."
Although not issue orders of Interpol's arrest of a affected by a red warning individual can take many Member States, according to the organization, the red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - which must be carried out by the National Police, especially if they are on a bilateral extradition treaty, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where assange likely present.
The action taken by Europe is outraged assanges lawyers, the gestures published a letter in which they informed about the fact that the 39-year-old, founder of WikiLeaks is prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that assange exit from Sweden, and the staatsanwältin connected to the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich beria sicherheitschef of Stalin, compared to the corresponding received approval.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal pursuit," is charged in the letter.
While the world is seeking it, and his mother thinks of Australia, from the innocence of its sohns claimed - assange to an unknown location, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the leader of the magazine time via Skype of an undetermined location from an interview. during the conversation he requested the resignation of the staatssekretärin, Hillary Clinton of the United States.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the order North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus have violated international agreements signed by the United States, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned by the pressesekretär of the White House, Robert gibbs, yesterday, of the request for resignation described as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we should attach importance to the views of a type with a website," he told the station CNN.
Obama himself has a high responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf, rusell travers, charged with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen.
The attempt by the spokesman of the präsidenden Barack Obama, assange less attention, is in contrast to proclaim the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in the next few days.
The congressman Peter King, from January will lead the chair in the national sicherheitskommitee of the House of Representatives, called on the staatsabteilung, has the opportunity to investigate WikiLeaks to put on the list of terrorist organisations," in order to seize and any support of the Commission, whose money or makes a contribution to pursue."
Tom flanagan, Advisor of the Canadian President Stephen harper was actually went even further, and he had to, assange must be "murdered" revoked his statement.
"Obama would need to turn it into a target and a not bemanntes plane or what use."
Who is not apologizing, Mike huckabee, was baptistischer Minister, former Governor of arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it has always been, the information in the government durchsickern left, he is guilty of treason and all what is no execution is eiine Fox to mild punishment," he told the station.
Puigcercós addiction to the carod close with a augenzwinkern peace in the erc
The Republican leaders would allow the party a secret VOTE ON HIS continuity in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for an internal turmoil in the ranks of this is the umpteenth time after the loss of 11 members and the half of the popular vote richtungslosen erc from the way to go.
The party's leader is aware that its rücktrittsdrohung the close of former parteiführers Josep lluís carod-rovira is not enough. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is so weakened as he does not bring the same worried about themselves and their mentor, as other former trends.
Therefore, the leader of esquerra seeks new critics to win with a augenzwinkern, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning announced yesterday that the more than 200 Regional Council members of erc secret for his stay in office could answer.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the carodisten miss the präsidenen a parking ticket wanted to, they could do this without reprisals should fear.
Indeed, the head of both the impression of division and would also like to avoid the submission under his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed he would feel with the half of the votes, plus a not confirmed, and he added without giving any of prozentwerten, a result of "in the Bulgarian style" will not be good.
The carod close are asking the President to offer more than just the party office. An insufficient gesture, since puigcercós the supreme body of the kongresse controlled.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to forcierung resignations, they will be compatible with the board a vorgehensplan from now until May.
For that, they expect to the drafting of the document on strategic umorientierung that the management will be put to the vote on the 18th of the Council is to be able to participate.
Their intention is to guarantee puigcercós. In return, these promises, the Congress should be brought forward in the autumn in 2011, which thinks the parteispitze already is a fact.
The leader of the erc is of the opinion that the "polyphonie" Pity the Stability and he wants to create a once and for all of the organisation to be brought into the situation, to launder their dirty related money behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, the incumbent conseller Josep huguet in his blog, symptomatic.
In view of this," the puigcercós an ideologue, the owner of innovació thought it is a fact that the party's leader "will be based in exchange for different goals."
He was five, two of which are at the forefront.
First of all, the "restructuring" of the vorstands, in order for this represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is the inclusion of new faces from carods environment.
The second could be the major news.
Huguet proposes that erc should the vollversammlungsprinzip when functioning finally give up.
It verfechtet him a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to the kongresse with elected representatives.
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells, an exception in the Spanish parteiensystem - is puigcercós' team, which has been in the last two kongressen had fought for the way.
Indeed, on the bebenden Assembly of the party leadership with the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips at a congress in 2008, which should deal with the reform of the Statute, was put in charge.
This deadline is yet to come, as infogle the internal aufruhe of recent years to address that this matter was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lauer are, might be the time to take up the matter again and for ever to be completed.

Luisa valenzuela read a text which he dedicated Gonzalo celorio, and the shultz then as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in and is the first person a champion, which is at the search to find out what is a "wound," and of doctor to a doctor, of which they did not answer, but receives indications to guide their narrative.

At the end, after a frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, the her on the way the efforts raubte, and the middle of it but said that the wound was not a scientific concept enthült of psychoanalytiker is the secret," the wound is this really open, the symbolic is the narbe."
The hauptfigur of narrative seufzt easier and does, which they only learned of the wound," that this really is open and does not exist." but it is convinced that the desire of the language and their fall blurred.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
From the nicaraguaner Sergio ramírez asked a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise of the invention', and in the the finger in the wound not mentioned, but is discovered.
With STATEMENTS OF THE magic realism, he is telling the clouds of a famous zauberin, covered, as well gereiste men zurückbrachte or the of a girl lost virtue wiederherstellte. The narrative, a turnaround and reported by America, the great novel, it from the start, not of his own lack of chronisten, and he quoted bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, - the writer - invited all of us, spottete the mock witnesses the set forth in the AS True Stories appeared, but in a different way would be the history of America's never been told was losing, with einbildungskraft, even the shame."

"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and the reality of the situation, we must define: and define often means to put the nail in the head and to harass those who feel much more comfortable if it in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without trouble nuances thinking, and also the powerful, the einzuteilen prefer the world in black and white said he and invited to do so to rediscover the meaning of the letter.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano is looking back at three defeats in endspielen, he has had to and ABS in his career, and three times he played crucial games.
The match between Santos laguna and Monterrey in the end game are also two different styles, from their respective coaches indicated to, and their meeting marked by gegensätzen is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano is looking back at three defeats in endspielen, he has had to and ABS in his career, but three times he has kept crucial games, and so far, it has been good, why this opportunity is very important for him.
The Argentinean has with the coin on the second champion coverage, it is a step behind the winners and surprisingly, he fought with the same team consecutive endspiele lagging behind.
The santistische stratege reached the first end game as coach in the 'torneo apertura 2002', as the Del morelia more of a free hand, with whom he had against toluca with 4-2 learnt a great defeat; later, with the 'clausura 2003', he received the decisive match that it, too, with 3-1 lost to rayados.
With Santos laguna already on the 'torneo bicentenario 2010," in which they played against Los diablos, rubén again had to share a setback, because the game with 2-2 against Los choriceros to take 210 spielminuten undecided began, but the penalty kick he came with 3-1 forward and received two ways of losing his name, but ultimately unsuccessful three of his players the eleven steps and the game did to a 4-3.
Rubén had already two endspiele with the diablos rojos and one with Monterrey, its great rival, lost. so he would not be persecuted by the accident again and to free themselves from the evil zauber, to be able to celebrate for the first time, a title, even though it confirmed that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I do not want to break statistics, that is for a club, for my affection, which I hingebe come to see me, and that is why the title, but what happened is the most important thing," commented on the steuermann previously, when he was asked about the lost endspiele.
The last end game is still remained strong in the memory, he assured him to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from this is that until the referee not to celebrate the end of Act, we cannot prepared, we are in line with the players, because the last time we were already prepared to auszuscheiden with two elfmetern, and I believe that this is a lesson to the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series could be resolved by means of elfmeterschießen do not concern it, because he trusts his players," you never want to arrive at the elfmeterschießen, we would like to conclude the regular spielzeit, but sometimes, there is no alternative and we need to be prepared, we were prepared in the previous tournee, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of anxiety or to intense desire to keep the title already in the hands that left us with something for this end game, and we hope that this time it will not come to this."
It is in romanso power, not just to be second champion and the glory to bring costs, the title for the first time.

Hydro-québec has by mutual agreement projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the wasserkraftprojekt eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the companies bpr, dessau, Groupe sm and axor, of which the most important part, which is the projektleitung a sum of $295 million without tender has been given.
This consortium, known as the 'énergie gérance," as a corollary of the decision of hydro-québec in 2004, was broken their responsibility, this important, hydroelectric project in the private sector to überantworten, formed a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there would have been a public tender.
For the parti québécois resorting to unternehmenskonsortien poses a serious ethical problem, that the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung, as well as an increase in prices evokes.
"This is a new way of a abgekarteten game and refuted the competition."
"This means that we now instead of fix games instead of in a secret way in an open form is carrying out," said sylvain yesterday simard, a member of the pq, at the press conference.
On early morning simard had raised the question before the French National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand him, as the public's interest in this way, can be served.

The model of the consortium is a global practice.
It is usually a temporary such temporary alliance, which allows it two or more companies to their expertise known on a necessity in a bid for a complex project to be expanded.
"The eastmain project" has a high komplexitätsniveau relating to its arbeitsausmaßes.
The bauverfahren is in progress, and should be drawn up by 2012.
But it was awarded the Treaty, and without a competition had given; it had already negotiations can take place.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec even in relatively simple projects by no means an exception. More
As noted the newspaper "Le devoir 'last week, is it in the area of the bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied the subject of regierungsermittlungen model of the consortium.
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows it to more than 200 consortia to appoint, some of which appear to be of consistent duration.
Working in this way, for example, the company dessau in partnership with the majority of their kernkonkurrenten, which cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin, Roche and tecsult count, which together.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, brings back to one and the same legal person, to dessau.
What the consortium 'énergie gérance concerned," Minister normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the baie James is subject to a special arbeitskräftedynamik since the 1970s, and that hydro-québec this fact gives into account in particular way."
Réal laporte, the major employer of Société d énergie de la baie James - sebj -, has issued a statement, which had over the fact rümpfen indicate that the Treaty on the projektleitung After agreement has been agreed.
"If you a tender power and there are only a few candidates, are your prices to soar."
"You have two options: Either you nimmst people, which are on this mart And you say to yourself. we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, that is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," laporte reiterated.
This the consortium "énergie gérance" APPROVED Treaty is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 of the parti québécois received$.
The contracts were either by the hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
After a review, the newspaper Le devoir "was more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the firms or their branches, including, in particular have been allowed ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010.
Snc-lavalin had received 22 contracts to gerafft, génivar had 16, tecsult 14 and dessau 10 here, without the participation of "énergie counting gérance."
All these contracts are negotiated.
You in the entire amount to $449 783 344, including the treaty with "énergie gérance 'on $295 131 564.
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four companies, which form the consortium - bpr, dessau, Groupe sm and axor - the "parti libéral you québec are well known."

Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not inspire me with confidence
Green, but am sceptical.
The quebecer consumer has little confidence to the key players of the sustainable growth, however, nor to the brand names or the öko-kennzeichnungen, characterised the taxes to his election.
Pity, although it in a media universe are where it of information for one of verantwortungsbewußteren consumption only as if, the barometer responsible consumption has led to a lack of credible information, a deficiency that the brakes on his commitment kenntlich power, as was the first reading, which was held yesterday.
Although they the use of what is known as the socially responsible have pushed products in the year 2010, the quebecer seem however, those who are trying to sell it to give little credit.
Two thirds of the quebecer population, to, in fact, the umweltengagement of firms to pay little believe, as the Greens unternehmenswerbung so betrays the from the verbraucherzentrum responsible of the University sherbrooke sophisticated administrative tool.
A out other findings: half of the consumers, doubts the trustworthiness of the official to the supposedly fair products angefügten certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which umweltbewußt declare, so the barometer.
For equal patterns, the discourse of the politicians to this issue of just 14.6% of the quebecer people seriously.
The information about responsible consumption appears, however, important to stimulation this konsumsegments, which currently out of approximately only a third of the quebecer crowded will consumers.
In fact, dämpften empty and dubious character of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second after the higher price of the products, from the barometer identified brake.
Moreover, a third of the quebecer is of the performance of the green products and services, which one is trying to put you in the hand, with mistrust.
According to a different communication had already over half of the consumers in the year 2010 changed their habits and predominantly changed the brand of one or more products, in order to give her conviction expression.
According to barometers they were preferred to 61% purchases dealers of their stadtviertels and encourages the purchase of food crops cultivated in their region.
Green and responsible. This year, the index had the umweltbewußten consumption in achieved a 100 64 of the maximalwertes - the homo consumus of Quebec loves it, to present itself as a king of the recycling, which is seeking to reduce its environment left traces, by he takes care of the welfare.
But the social and environmental awareness seems yet to make just before his car, so the barometer, just 28% of the quebecer have stated, in 2010 or to have preferred the mitfahrzentrale used public transport, to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The zufußgehen and the cycling have also been endorsed by 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage, the klischeevorstellungen sources.
Staatsanleihe for the takeover of excentris
The quebecer Government, which has been called on by the parallèle Société angus, as well as the company, is financially in the takeover of the kinokomplexes to take part excentris, says with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The entwicklergesellschaft angus, as well as the company parallèle, a donation to the tune of 7 million dollars from the kultusministerium for the adoption of the kinokomplexes belonging Daniel langlois excentris on the boulevard saint-laurent had hoped to have this back to his normal cineastischen function, do not appear to überantworten given what they have asked.
Although the government has accepted to involve in this matter, but on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation offers the quebecer government but a bond in less than the amount, initially hoped for the benefit of a viable solution to conditions to launch could, at least in the opinion from the gerüchteküche State entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the bittgesuch, since the revised downwards summenmäßig once again.
A proposal, along with an action plan has been made by the President of the "Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles' - sodec - François macerola, st-pierre sent to Minister, who is leading the acts excentris.
Several days ago, he had given her a last sachbericht.
The gegenvorschlag of cabinet was sent to the sodec, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and angus now have time to 31 December, to respond to this.
In any case the premise of the staatsspende seems genuinely been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft the cinema and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition in support of the takeover of excentris aufgelehnt had, by the argument on, the culture minister did not provide financial aid to immobilienprojekte there to send, which he does not have other kinosälen.
Several other market participants of the segment, however, in contrast, substantial economic aid.
Following the kinochef Daniel langlois had eigenfinanzierten cinema construction of the for more than ten years with great difficulties, the autorenkino presented in the premises of his kinokomplexes, which could justify the's unique position from the Treasury.
The lack of kinosälen, the independent films show, is more than evident in Montreal, and excentris knew his clients want to keep on board.
The Société angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top, taxes, for its part, a privately funded campagne, of which they hoped for a sum of 700 000$ to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009 only a single screen so that continues to show films in excentris, namely Le parallèle.
Aim of the future erwerber is, the three kinosäle on 27 February next year with the exhibition of the very successful film of Mr beauvois "of reopening of the dieux 'Hommes et.
Christian yaccarini but the newspaper Le devoir 'has not removed, and you ignored what he and his group think of the proposals to the bottom respectively, which it has made them.
Secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks were spread that reveal the secret about what the United Nations under The inferiority complex of Canadians; they, but with the same blow against the Americans consider the überlegenheitsgefühl Canada open to letztgenannter.
As a result, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters in the round has not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to impose its budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, were publicly circulated yesterday, provide even more pikante details as the very substantial content, in which it has to knabbern.
The 22 September 2008, a link, that is, in the period in which the federal wahlkampage was in full swing befindlich, writing about this, from what point the United Nations no longer participate in its political leaders are discussing the operations.
To the great surprise of David wilkins of the used in Ottawa, American ambassador.
Mr wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation.
"The kanadiern almost led innewohnender inferiority complex, perhaps the Canadian, political leaders are much more to do so to speak of internal discussions of daily life, as the United States in this election the buck - as in 1988 in the campaign on the free trade - of course," he describes.
The United Nations, he schlußfolgert, thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipräsent but potentially threatening, in order to speak of him."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less so, as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Naturally," he evaluated, "The ability of a candidate, a party and it should be much more of a parteichefs to lead such an essential relationship, which has the voters to the polls as a key factor in the sense."
The other expression of this sense of importance in the reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry breese, geschäftsträger in Ottawa, gesendeten communication, the President Barack Obama is supposed to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their trip will help the continued existence of the government to ensure in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, in Canada, his first deficit will be clear after more than a decade, on the basis of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars has been created," describes breese.
Nowhere he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent the Parliament would and that so conditional toppled by the coalition of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms persist.
Another, from January 2008, and on the part of the Ambassador wilkins wrote communication informed Washington of increasing negative image that the broadcast on cbc spread, dramatic series of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and h2o, in which you little subtle statements to Maher arar, or abführungen for the purposes of the "no-fly-list" by muskelprotze can monitor the CIA conducted examinations.
A different communication spoke in detail about how Hillary clinten again in its French counterpart Bernard Kouchner have asked in their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe is prepared to accept some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is alleged to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual decision "case by case."
àm at the end of the meeting, the staatsekretärin a piece of paper," he has described in terms of Omar khadr, handed out a 15 years of Muslims Canadian origin."
"The staatssekretärin has promised that the acts durchzusehen again."
Finally we realise that people. Getting worked WikiLeaks emotions on the website, in
Tom flanagan, an old and Stephen harper very closely of related advisers, had on cbc stated that those responsible for this massive leakage "should be killed."
Referiert he was here to Mike huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, yesterday in Cancun Trade and Industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in the treibhausgases - CFC - Proposed, which is nearly a third of the additional reduction, which must be carried out in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes his position in the steps of the specific implement big projects of the UN in Cancun hopes, in order to compensate for the absence of forced reduktionsverpflichtungen of developed countries.
According to the plan expressed yesterday would - gt - the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes of because of the lighting of the Earth are cast be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly on the market are from 50 to 70%, by fluoreszierende or better yet, would be replaced by leuchtdioden - led -.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This represents an equivalent of 70% of the smoke of the global fleets.
In Copenhagen had last year the large abgasemittenten, like the United States, China, Europe and others, including those from Canada, was voluntary reduktionsplänen committed itself to ensuring that the global fckw-emissionen of 53 gt to 49 gt should herunterschrauben.
Pull out of this assessment, it would, however, still 5 gt today by the year 2020, in order to stabilize the klimaanstieg by 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this spiral out of control.
In the weißglühenden pears entweicht 95% of energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption reduced by 75%, with the new led-glühbirnen to this once again in the double energy demand.
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new led-glühbirnen, such as those to the manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week, this society has also took part in the uno-studie - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume less energy than a weißglühende pears 80%, which is a suggestion ways to make the savings of auswechselungsplanes provides that should be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new incandescent light bulbs, they can also make very little heat with a regelwiderstand work.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have pointed out that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves in, because they contain mercury and that they are so as to sondermüll dump what in the developing world is not always possible, except for the producers are available to bring centre.
The main source of quecksilberemissionen on the planet, according to the report, however, does not represent the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit much more mercury, by the weißglühenden pears wasted to produce electricity.
In the United States alone push this coal plants 25,000 tonnes of mercury from every year.
The report sets out in detail the profits thanks to this international programmes, which each country would generate.
Indonesia, this would, for example, a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2 that means an equivalent of 3.5 kohlekraftwerken whose erbauung Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Criticism of Ivory Coast expected the announcement of the election results

Around forty minutes before fristablauf, the President of the cei was the television confirmed that the Commission would "go on with the work," in order to announce the results.
There are many calls from all over the world on Wednesday, has become the cei may at last the name of victory in the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and its opponents of the Office alassane declare ouattara.
However, the gbagbo-lager counts with the cancellation of 'rogue' votes in the north by with a constitutional council, the forces nouvelles - fn - by the ex-rebellenlager during the failed putsches have been achieved in September 2002.
Pascal affi n 'guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that on the part of the fn's manoeuvres to deter intimidation of voters in the north of the country to the supporters of the president had to go out and vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo on with a constitutional council will be taken into account.
However, the gbagbo-kontrahenten are now more of the view that the country's High Court of Justice is not neutral, because he by Paul Yao n 'dré is structured, a politically closely related to Gbagbo.
Alassane ouattara, man of the north, which has any link to the ex-rebellen denies that the delay in the announcement of the election results and asked Gbagbo judged as "unacceptable," to respect them, even if he did not go so far is to ask for the victory.
Reiterate its bündnisparter, Gbagbo blockiere with regard to the publication of the results, because he knows that he had lost; and, to submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after it prevented the Electoral Commission have to publish the results, seie illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were thought to be the crowning glory of of association and versöhnungsprozesses in a country, which for years, was divided into two parts.
The United Nations had the politicians of the Ivory Coast on Wednesday warned that it could be kept in the event of possible riots responsible for this.

Affaire clotilde reiss: the elysée-palast exaggerates its mittlerfunktion for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 by May 2010, held the fate of clotilde reiss, a young French forscherin, who was detained for 'spying' in Iran, the French public in breath, left the diplomacy in alarmbereitschaft and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the thoughtful look of the diplomats of the United States.
The and received by WikiLeaks of the newspaper "Le Monde" durchgesehenen American documents be some price behind this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had declared his strategy which went as far as to the Americans, this advice to deal with their own crisis of 'taking of hostages' in Iran - a small group of wanderern - to give.
They show on, such as the French players have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young französin not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and held captive by the American justice system as a result of trade in materials in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes iraners sought to have gegeleistung.
After all, they are the way in which the French Bureau to manipulate the media to the purposes, has tried to make this the idea to credible, the Syrian president bachar al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of clotilde reiss played, in a harsh light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A redigiertes in Paris on 12 August 2009 diplomatentelegramm is entitled "Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with the taking of hostages."
François richier, had a elysée-berater in strategiefragen, is accompanied by patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomatin kathleen allegrone.
They declared her French method.
The advised the Americans to do all we can to their own nationals rückzuführen, which would forcibly detained in Iran.
"makes noise," they said, 'articulated loudly and clearly and without unterlass "the words" grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence, "" immediate release "in the media.
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in a predicament, respects the very sensitive to his image.
"This is all the more so because, as you ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because the 'silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche on on unauffälligem way, the Iranians are "masters in ausweichmanövern."
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners was a "geläufige Iranian tactics": "taking hostages for the purposes of political blackmail."
He has announced in, the release of clotilde reiss from the prison - the on 16 August should be reached on the days, in which it is in the French Embassy vanishes - "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' - 230,000 euro bail -.
And he is telling state that the Elysée antizipiere Further taking of hostages, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future a different about arrest 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde reiss is 12 days ago has been released from prison, however, is still held in Iran.
An information has been in circulation. the Iranians Majid kakavand whose extradition to the United States because illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran are calling for is to entscheid of a judge in Paris has been released from detention.
The American message is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing koinzidenz.
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the purchases of the material is scheduled for the nuclear programme, represents the release of Majid khakavand bad news.
France has taken a horse trading on board?
The liberation of the iraners against the party of the französin?
At a meeting with kathleen again allegrone on 4 September François richier assured me that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was "totally surprised by the decision of a judge," but I have also tried to aufzulehnen against this.
"It has been a frequent exchanges between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" - now michèle alliot-marie -, but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he said.
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
Of the elysée-berater adopted a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomatin, the Iranians "would have been, at present in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the gewahrsams clotilde reiss care not to use statements by the Elysée its efforts in Iran and organised by the media "to make fluchtversuche" Believe that the Syrian president bachar al-Assad games a "significant" and "important mittlerrolle."
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony and say that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several articles reflect the official French version.
A on 25 August 2009 datierendes telegramm invites "the medienblitz of the French authorities."
What is based as much "dankesbezeugung" to Mr Assad asks the Paris message.
"Despite their statements, the French authorities secretly to be full of lobpreis that they have only a vague idea of what the syrier actually have done."
The document, then deal with the reasons that have led the Elysée that this fiction to collapse.
The intensive kommunikationsbemühungen "aims to Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria to confirm," he analysis.
A policy launched in 2008," at the time of many kritikerstimmen in France and abroad was perceived as premature and unverdient."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria, to see the experiments to lead to what we can achieve belobigung by being plays a constructive role in the region."
Goal, it is also "to sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American message knows this from good source.
On 11 August, François richier had entrusted to her: "Of course, we do not know whether the syrier which have always done."
"But we have in spite of everything, thanks for you."
"This should at least cause confusion on the Iranians."
Clotilde reiss go back to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a message he thanks to the President of Brazil, from Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
No internet gambling for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law, known as the "the aschenbrödel," which it will ban the young people, to play after midnight online-games by the blocking access, as implied regierungsverantwortliche to it to them.
A law that is to call upon the online-spiele-betreiber, young people under the age of 16 after midnight for denying access to these games, which will be presented to Parliament in December, schilderten representatives from education and familienministerien.
"Many children these games play all night long and then have difficulty in learning in the school, and that, too, during the day to lead a normal life."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo rin, with this bill betrauter ministerialbeauftragter of the French press agency agence France Press.
The online-games were then again from 6 a.m. to access.
The herstellergesellschaften would have time to prepare for the application of the law for a year, so to specify it.
To ask the government fasser as well in the eye, the producer, the time limit provided a day for access to these games those young people respectively, whose parents ask, added the person responsible.
He will also make them available to those people who want it to happen, gratisprogramme, which will make it possible to limit the spending time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most often "network" countries, and the newspapers regularly reports by various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in world online-game-wettbewerben.
In November, South Korea with 58 other nations had four goldmedaillen in the world cyber war games won.
World Cup 2018-2022: the FIFA will appoint the ausrichterland
In bright excitement because of korruptionsverdacht will appoint the exekutivkomitee by FIFA on Thursday ausrichterländer of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the rangeln for influence and threaten to push it was lobbying the technical criteria in the background.
But one thing is certain: the issue 2018 the königsdisziplin of the FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional hochburg - the 4 candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, the niederlande-belgien -.
The issue then 2022 is something; the International Football Federation hopes to be exotic new territories after the premiere on the African continent in the year 2010 - Qatar, Australia - to be able to win, or its branch in the United States or in the far east - Japan and South Korea - to pursue.
The list of figures, part of the delegation - David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of State, Zidane, beckham, the cruyff - is the degree of economic and political use of a World Cup.
So the actions behind the scenes threaten stopping until the last minute.
Otherwise difficult to set up a hierarchy of the candidates.
After the evaluationsbericht by FIFA, provide the English, spanisch-portugiesische - 2018 - and American - 2022 - acts bessseren arguments than that of its competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees on the hour of the election will not be so important.
The Sunday Times, which provoke the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees - reynald temarii and Amos Adamu - of the beginning of the revelations, and would have been just as well the opportunities for their own country can ruin, cradle of football, which was allowed to fight the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC had given the breeding ground again on Monday, saying it had a broadcast dokumentarbericht, the three senior members of the kommitees, Ricardo teixeira, Nicolas leoz and issa hayatou is under attack.
Reason enough to irritate the FIFA and the English leaders in embarrassment to bring, in the first place, with David Cameron in these last few weeks had conducted an intensive was lobbying.
The Head of Government hopes for a resumption of the successful schachzuges by his predecessor Tony Blair, which in 2005 had made the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
This intensive use would be enough to enhance the image of England before the kommitee again?
Nothing is less safe because the duo spanien-portugal there is no shortage of trümpfen with its already finished stages, his expertise - 82 in Spain in Barcelona Olympic Games 92, World Cup and Euro 2004 in Portugal - and its fußballkultur.
But the two countries' economic and financial dark side could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal which make the opportunities of Russia, despite its shortcomings in the dossier - stadiums, hotels, transport - has become the important outsider rise.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to unumwundenen allusion to the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the kommiteemitglieder denounced.
"It bewirft them with dirt, you try to compromise," Putin lashed out.
For 2022, the United States, bolstered by the experience of 1994, to be the logical favoriten.
First economic world power, headquarters of the fifa-hauptsponsoren, the country yielded seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very beautiful project separately.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries which had the mitorganisiert competitions in 2002.
Another threat, the FIFA's hot desired approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities in 2022 will lapse.
With Australia and Qatar, the aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had drawn, the FIFA is all the stops, however, their expansion in the direction of new areas, that pose a risk, because these two countries certainty.
Australia could as well as Japan and South Korea under the from the European countries - because of the zeitverschiebung - akquittierten weakness of television rights have to suffer the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle was really gestutzt.
Mitterrand, allow them to believe that he stutze.
Mr Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac were not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next get them.
The current head of state will be so candidate in the year 2012.
But the offenkundigkeit is the side of the mysteriums that accompanies the präsidentschaftsfunktion, not good to face.
We therefore need to act as if the doubts in future would be.
In one, as well as in the other way.
2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac against, and a third mandate is not ruled out, without even to believe that.
On 15 November assured in ernstem Nicolas Sarkozy tone "at some point in the autumn of the year 2011," his decision to take.
That he on the ump-parlamentariern on dienstagabend in the Elysée the prospect of "two mandates" full capacity would bring, therefore had a little fieberhaftigkeit widespread.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The President was just to remind that the amendments to the Constitution from 2008, the number of all five years of terms to just two.
A statement he has made no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meeting in a humorous tone.
"You have, at worst, seven and a half years with me, or, at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "does not believe that I do not think about over the period later."
His words from the day before yesterday make it no longer the candidates than the previous day, but no less.
Should they create comments, then for a dual reason.
The acceleration of wettlaufes about the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy is to expose about it.
On the contrary, it is an obvious candidacy in 2012, the number of Members of the PS early than anticipated to challenge call.
The poor polls on the other side.
Together for the first time would the voters the right a candidacy of François Fillon, the of Nicolas Sarkozy - 46% against 44%, according to the survey of the bva-l 'express - prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there are careful with the ump no discussions about that," responded immediately and the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he would not candidate," Mr Raffarin agrees with.
"He will always believe to be able to win," Alain juppé, which has gone along with the offenkundigkeit corrected.
Euro, the ECB is forced to maintain their ankäufe of staatspapieren
The ECB last year's final assembly of the zentralbankrats should provide an opportunity possibilities to show how you get out of the crisis, or at least the order of a large number of using unconventional measures of monetary policy to declare the end of the year, to reach its conclusion.
The crisis of the European public debt to the central bank in Frankfurt, It can definitely not afford, even today, more than verwirken tense situation on the European bond markets in order to provoke not the deterioration.
The political cost it would be far too high.
The French finanzministerin Christine lagarde had yesterday during a press conference held by the ECB, active role in favour of the resolution of the staatshaushaltsverschuldung Europe welcomes.
It has not dared to say whether it was of the opinion that the central bank can still do more, for example, by boosting their programme of the ankäufe of government bonds.
"I do my reasons for my European trading partner before -... -."
Mr Trichet, President of the ECB had the previous day in Brussels, at his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs not shown very redegewandt about his projects, but instead, pointed out that the programme of the purchases of staatspapieren content on the secondary market "weiterbetrieben" and that we in the Assembly on Thursday would be "will see how the decisions."
Only certainty, the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009 historically.
In practice, the obligationskäufe of schatzkammer last week by the ECB doubled to about 1,35 billion euros.
And according to leaks of some traders, they have made new purchases to Irish and Portuguese staatspapieren yesterday.
Overall, the central banks of the euro system made since May 2010 purchases to the tune of 67 billion euros.
Among the traders is certainly not in doubt for the anticipation of a weiterverfolgens of kaufkurses - see side 29 -.
The volkswirte expect has no more remarkable change of course.
If the anleihengeschäfte of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB will be, will be the latter still in full geldmittelreserven to freigiebige way to create, and over a period of a week for up to three months.
The volkswirte are already taken today to point that this measure is still will extend for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme to substantial kind."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk to provoke new tensions in the short term," suspected Michael schubert, volkswirt of the commerzbank.
"for the course of the first quarter 2011 anticipates the progressive exit seems to me more likely,," for its part, Norbert bräms, volkswirt in sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of intervention in the market of the public debt," the ECB should such a kaufvolumen of securities aufrechthalten, that the sluggish market crowded," adds Norbert bräms added.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks to the markets of the public debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no other choice but to keep their presence on the market.
"It needs to the lack of any price to the steller investors on the market and such action to enter the hasty enthusiasm on the returns to prevent paid to the most vulnerable states," bezeugte yesterday an important obligationeninhaber.
Because if the interest rates on the boom, the States would be prevented from more, to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is in Italy to meet
After a worrying wochenanfang for Italy, the situation yesterday with the decline in the eckzinsen to 10 years, a little relaxed.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti had the situation as "unentzifferbar" qualify and have it with a "unvorhersagbaren" weekend they immediately, however, expect to hear what.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the German interest rates would have his record of 210 basispunkten achieved, and the prices of the Treaties to meet the konkursrisikos were increased to 263 points, which had caused a certain kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates is around 400 basispunkten.
His right hand, gianni letta, however, had as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible danger from the Ireland said.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, not as Greece and Ireland is."
"The bad news is that Italy as Portugal is," Irwin said stelzer, volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, that may be problem is the absenz of economic growth and the associated schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge, which the state put in danger, its financing needs no longer able to meet.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future an Italian growth of 1.1 percent in 2011 and will of 1.4% in the year 2012 expected... although the, from the Senate to test this haushaltsbudget with 1.3% and 2% counts.
On this basis, the EU Commission, calculated the fiscal deficit in the next year will still 4.3% of GDP - contrary to the projected by the governments 3.9% - and - instead of 2.7% - 3.5% in the year 2012.
That, as a result, the turmoil for a new haushaltskollektiv, that is after the feiertagen could be used to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new tightening measures must be taken," says Auditors Olli Rehn.
On the hour receives Italy, the help of international institutions.
"The very foundations of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are settled, the again assured we have known for a long time," arrigo sadun, Italian Trustees of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"At the moment there is no problem, either in short term, in the long term, it is from Italy, despite its high levels of debt - 119,2% of GDP in the year 2011, A. D. R. - calling for lower stabilisationsfortschritte than other countries," observed Pier Carlo padoan chef-volkswirt the OECD.
The question of political unstetigkeit remains.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi are faced with a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the elections are already brought forward could be organized at the end of March.
So it is a little bit favourable period for a decision with regard to a serious crisis before.
Europeans think about the development of the antikrisenmaßnahmen after
Christine lagarde, it had only within the framework of a press conference in Paris yesterday stress: "I believe that it was proved to it on the sonntagnachmittag, as well as on the evening: the Europeans think clearly together, we are ready and committed to defend its currency and right of the area."
Although absolutely relatively - the withdrawal in the zinsfüßen registered yesterday of the European staatsobligationen was water on the wheels of governments and the European Central Bank.
Talk about a normalisierungsbeginn, however, cannot be.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could be most effective for the schuldenvermerk of Portugal, the target of speculators nowadays, lower.
"As in May is a reeller lack of clarity and political visibility for the most rests on the banking systems," the opinion of the volkswirte the exane GNP paribas.
Above all, especially since "The political time passes much more slowly than the markets."
The European countries, which are both this gap and are aware of the danger, which is hiding in it, well, are stepping up the discussions on strengthening the already existing antikrisenmaßnahmen.
The informal consultation between the most directly affected the G20 Finance Ministers and, by extension, with its opposite numbers are progressing well.
And this in regard to the meetings of eurogroupe and ECOFIN early next week.
The ECB meets today.
Of the plan is the lot of using unconventional measures to rückenstärkung the countries in the euro area in the markets - see the bottom - fadenkreuz.
With regard to the eu-stabilitätsfonds, whose executive director Klaus regling has already started on Tuesday in singapour its asien-tour to investors in the Far East to inform you about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not express fundraising, he is certainly this on the ground.
The first werpapierausgaben on the part of the eu-stabilitätsfonds is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official of American representative of the agency entrusted to Reuters, the United States supported a possible rise in the mobilized by the additional direct engagement of the IMF fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, in which, for its part, is preparing to structural reforms, particularly in the area of arbeitsmarktorganisation to take on.
Reforms to the austerity are added, but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid, take a different road, as Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one, and the other is at any price to avoid it, have to ask for international help, before they set up their own budgetkorrektive and on essential structural reforms decided not to have them the confidence again in the long term.
The European Capital providers, in turn, have with regard to the available options to speed up the normalization process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was in Paris on November 24 on the movement, as the first created by the idea that if the 750 had mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund billion euros would not be enough, so the Union would not hesitate to attack again in their own pockets.
The volkswirte barclays capital, in terms of the market of the European public debt at the forefront of related player, judge, an increase of about 100 billion euro would be enough," preferably "in the form of a direct liquiditätsspritze.
This means there is: the European mechanism dotierter finanzstabilisierung, which currently stands at 60 billion euros.
A forum, where all the opportunities has to be carefully considered in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions worse.
Snow and glatteis: 24 departments in alarmstufe orange
The schnee-episoden still draw verkehrsschwierigkeiten, especially in the secondary transport networks in the Brittany and threaten to affect different economic activities.
Twenty four departments are now in alarmstufe orange because of the threat of a schnee- and glatteisrisikos.
The regions your, eure-et-loir, deux-sèvres and vienne are those already in alarmstufe orange 20; 18, since mittwochnachmittag joined departments, and two, which is currently the dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to météo France, touch the intensive schneeschauer the Gironde north and the charentes, it schneit easy on the ET ile-de-france.
In the departments concerned will be schneedecken from 2 to 5 feet in some places, also, as well as 1 expected from 7 to 10 cm to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
These are the regions charente, charente-maritime côtes d armor, finistère, Gironde, dordogne, poitou and the regions basse-normandie, ile-de-france and limousin.
The snowfall early are remarkably enough in order to provoke verkehrsbehinderungen and certain economic activities to affect, says météo ahead of France.
In the region côtes d armor, several regionalstrassen are closed to the schwerverkehr of more than 7.5 tons, including the transport axes guingamp-lannion and saint-brieuc-loudéac.
The transport situation of secondary roads in Brittany, according to the verkehrspolizisten advise against it, to use its own vehicle only in the notfalle, very difficult, and the use of certain ter-reisebusse has been withdrawn on the whole day.
In the picardie the schulverkehr on Thursday was lifted.
Planned for schwerverkehr, on Wednesday evening were no specific restrictive measures.
The prefect's institution 'calls for the drivers to the utmost caution on the roads and the corresponding adjustment of its fahrverhaltens on."
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation - dgac - called on the airlines to 25% of its from the airport in Paris on Thursday roissy and 10% of the orly be removed from startenden flights because of the expected strong snowfall early.
The dgab recommends that the flugpassagieren to contact their airline.
The airports in South London Gatwick, as well as the airport closed in Edinburgh, Scotland, have until Thursday morning.
Métro grand Paris: first financial skizzen
On the ile-de-france for the debate on the modernization of the transport industry is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
We call on referring in particular the 23 billion for the underground Grand Paris in memory, which the Société you grand Paris is being built.
In order to guide the baubeginn of the sgp under way, the state has declared a kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros.
In theoretical consideration, this is the amount of money, which would then allow the sgp, on a part of the finanzsumme on her double to give the markets.
Today, it is first projections come trends, after all.
The ergänzungshaushalt by 2010, this morning studied by the finanzkommission, contains the measures provided for the National Assembly, to raise the first part of this money.
It is one of two measures: the creation of a special tariff to erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices at the ile-de France.
The former, you remove Article 15 of the gesetzesentwurfes, goes in favour of the public broadcasting center Société du grand Paris'."
Puts: 'This is the product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Zweitere is a renewal of existing corporate income tax: "in order to have this modernise, in order to increase the resulting from their product and the increase of the Société you to überantworten grand Paris."
How much would bring the?
A mystery.
This amount is not quantified in the text.
Far removed from the 4 billion is one.
"It is said that the fiscal resources be added to the 4 billion euros of kapitaldotation, be found by the State and the Société du Grand Paris to be done for the project and after," is to come from the explanatory set out.
In the sgp can you find this system does not offensive.
"Since the moment in which they scored Revenue - The two taxes, that R. -, one can cover the projektierung on for three years and then only from the 4 billion, 'it will draw said.
"This is going to be listed in the budget and deducted after."
The sgp estimates that 2013, will be started to note the 4 billion for the budget in 2014.
This measure, 4 promised billion of which one can still seek long will provoke, is in danger, a right, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
The Wikileaks affaire has a double meaning.
On one side, it has, a scandal, the emerging as obvious scandal is just a scandal in sinner hypocrisy, which ruled the beziehunge between the states, the people and the press.
On the other hand, it has announced to extensive changes at international level, and is a taste of the dominated by recession future.
But let us take one thing at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file prepared by a Secret Service - of any nation - exclusively made up of zeitungsausschnitten.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw from no more than what you to read for months - in any case in any old journal had - except for those whose owner was Berlusconi - and the shocking karikaturierte face gaddafis offered kabarettkünstlern already substance for their sketche for a long time.
The rule, after the secret files should only from, is already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library, which covers esotherischen publications, they will discover that every plant - about the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler - exactly a repetition of what has already been written in previous works.
This is therefore not alone, that the author will not publish research okkulter texts - yet, therefore, that he does not know where to find news on the nicht-existierende would be -, but because those who are the okkultismus to think of nothing different from what you already know, and confirmed what you already have learned.
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown.
As the geheimakten.
The informer is wrong, and lazy - or limited spirit - is also the head of the Secret Service - he could otherwise be whatever libération - editor, for example, the only deemed to be true what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the staatsdezernat were the same as those who newsweek already had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss over the revelations that dossiers made?
On one side, is this what each educated person already know, that the messages, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then, the government can take each other could appeal or an aircraft, in order to make up for the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren.
All of ermittlungsfilmen old viewers know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should do to ignore this.
Still, the fact that it publicly to repeat, violates the task of hypocrisy and is used to set the American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers can tap the geheimsten SECRETS OF THE most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats.
Furthermore, rather than the victims,, the scandal brings the "scharfrichter in trouble."
But we are giving the deep nature of what has happened.
Former to combine Orwell times, it was all power as a Big Brother, the every gesture of his subjects controlled.
Orwell's prediction would be able to turn out to be quite right since then, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction made the hotel, visited the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would be in a total victims of auges of power.
However, what if we introduce, what is going on today that even the secret krypten of power can no longer the control of a hackers escape, it is said to be directed the kontrollgang to unilaterally and will zirkelförmig.
The power to monitor all citizens, but every citizen, or at least the hackers, erwählt than vindicator of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience.
But how can keep a power, which is no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets?
It is true, Georg simmel said earlier that A real secret is an empty secret - and an open secret can never be reveals -; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's, in fact, is free of geheimis a secret, since it reveal the public sphere; but the styles of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meant to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither he nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama against it.
What will be the consequences of this violation, such a huge power has been done?
It is obvious that the States will make in future no reserved more online information - that would be a on the street corner angeklebten amount to aushang.
But it is also clear that it with the latest technologies in vain is hoped to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than moved to find out if and when a Head of State in a plane has contacted and one of his colleagues.
How could be private and only for some ears certain relations in the future?
I am well aware that my prediction after science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but at the moment I am compelled to present the regierungsagenten, in a secret way preoccupied to uncontrollable marschrouten moving, order with their communications anywhere else, than the mere memory, and also the few written information they have, in the schuhabsatz verbergend.
The information would be stored in single copy in closed existence: In fact, the Watergate spionageversuch had less success has been made, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write the technology today as a cancer is moving ahead, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized communications, a telegrafen reconstructed the Internet with - Telephone - draht.
The - analogue - videokassetten had allowed the filmforschern, a film volume for volume auszukundschaften by one from behind forward spulen and was able to reveal all of the secrets of the montage while the - numerical - CDs today allow nothing other than to jump chapter by chapter, which is in makroportionen.
With the fast trains going one within three hours by air from Rome to Milan, while this including the umsteigens requires three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional return to car and horse that politics and communication technology.
A final observation.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what kind of secrets between the embassies were forged.
At present, it is the messages, call for the confidential information provided by the press.
Climate: as France its finanzversprechen schönredet
A year after the Copenhagen, it is time to compliance with the Treaty quickly dissolved finanzierungsversprechen - also known as "almost start" or premature Finance - to investigate the developing countries have been dealt with.
And the rough French schönredereien are exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed to allocate $30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France - which is 420 million per year - 1.26 billion euros.
At the opening of the cop16, the EU held all the stops in order to convince its partners from the fact their commitment with regard to the fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer, large nebenevents, broschürenverteilung vorgehensbericht of its Member States, press conference.
The operation transparency is remarkable and extent of its real value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would like to see all developed countries on the same präzisionsniveau made the same.
The EU announced to have released 2.2 billion euros in the year 2010, what you are on the right way to respektbezollung brings its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012.
But if you looking into the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new, and an additional," in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without be to the detriment of the official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what means "new and an additional."
While the EU Commission had recommended a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which it regards as best.
The EU Commission has, for example, a benchmark for those of the year 2009 for: the international finance are maintained, and is within the framework of the funding," fast-start "About 150 million for three years to do so.
Other countries have similar guidelines, either in terms elected year or about conditions at the level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France was of the opinion that the funding of 'new projects "in the year 2010 are" new and an additional."
In other words, there are no guidelines on the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of official development assistance.
In practical terms, the total value of the French support the developing countries can remain stable - or even decline - - France is pretending to comply with its commitment with regard to the "new and additional funding."
Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still not rule, and each elects its rechenmodus about it.
Some, such as France, for example, are 1 lend _ as equivalent with 1 donated _.
This is apparently only it is hard to support them: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment - often projects that are based on effektivster technology - allied to the emissionseindämmung can be justified, it is misleading, to present the euro, and we as a word for a Euro donated... should also captured only the cost of loan for the kapitalgeberland than commitment - that is to say the equivalent of interest rate - to be counted.
But France has nothing different in the sense than the following reasons: it '"respect its commitment of 420 million euros, making it 91,5% loans begin - 389,8 million euro - and 8.5% accorded - 36,1 million euro - -, see the EU documents in order to convince themselves.
France is the only country of the EU that loans up on a large scale.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia - among other things - follow up their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to meet their commitments, France just 10 cents and understands including a similar efforts.
A hokuspokus.
All in all, France in its fast-start-finanzierung operates with a double fraud: to be part of a weiterentwicklkung of the action at the time, and the other part with the reality of the financial contributions.
France will be able to let it, believe that it 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promise and saves it 36,1 million euros.
The manipulation of Ministry of Finance - as it was in fact it seems that bercy to have carried out the arbitrage - could lead to a negative effect twice; even eu-intern - why the other Member States with the donations will continue, but if there is enough to lend? - and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not fully be fooled...
The chapter of the premature finance only a small problem in a relatively short period of time in comparison to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the scale of the unfccc machine.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As it always was, it is vital to its lesson to learn from this first year verfrühter finance.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its verbuchungsart for the 2011 to 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could make progress on the discussions on the long term streitgegenstand Finance - another, decisive and currently discussed subject -: you escapes the issue of "Not verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart of its loans.
France could change its position, in order to be equally ahead of the curve on the disputes, as is the case for other things.
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister kosciusko-morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans would naturally is necessary for The International Trust to raise the place for further discussion.
Sounding the alarm - of children's pesticides
A child of 10 years, takes on the day 81 different chemical substances, as a this Wednesday of the Association of générations futures - former movement for the protection of human rights and the respect of future generations - published study.
The association, which stated that its results "in view of the small number of reflect analyzed samples of No statistically significant value, but illustrationscharakter of issue be handled" between July and September had the usually over a period of four to the meals food consumed by a nearly 10 years child plus a zwischenmahlzeit bought in the supermarkets in oise and Paris.
The typical meals,, including official recommendations from five obstteilen and fresh frucht- three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, as well as naschereien from laboratories in the search for chemical substances have been investigated, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The tellerbilanz is stunning, 81 chemical substances, including 42 as potentially or likely carcinogenic that and five karziogen as safe klassifizierte, as well as 37 substances with endokrinin-störfaktor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International krebsforschungszentrum.
"Even if in the annähernden all the cases in the legal limits for any chemical substance is not be exceeded held individually, you remove this collection is very good, that is the reality, in which the consumer or substances with endokrinin-störfaktor carcinogenic substances may be suspended, is cause for concern," said the association.
Only the butter and already included in the breakfast of tea with milk already more than ten of potentially carcinogenic remnants and three as carcinogenic proven safe, as well as more than 20 residues, which can affect the hormonsystem.
The apple imported from Brazil, as zwischenmahlzeit planned for the study, has traces of six on chemical substances, including a banned in France fungizid.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including in the lunch, in which the study has found traces of a banned insektizids strong in the EU.
In addition, were the hacksteak, the tuna from the Pandora, even the baguette and packed the kaugummi of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the leitungswasser, the analyses the presence of nitrates and chloroform brought to light.
At the dinner was the lachssteak with 34 identified chemical residues on "richest," and even the To Do the meal plastikteller was not used in the mikrowelle unencumbered.
The schlußendliche risk this "schadstoffcocktails" for the consumers' will probably undervalued, "the study.
For its part, the 'Alliance Europe ecologie-les verts' - ee-lv - has "given the urgency of the situation," proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop the "increase in diseases of civilisation."
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority - EFSA - about the presence of arrears 365 of various identified, identified in fruit and vegetables pesticides, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in getreiden.
