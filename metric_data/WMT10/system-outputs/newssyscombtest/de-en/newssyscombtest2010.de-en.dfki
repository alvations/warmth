Snow mangle on the mountains torments the hotel proprietors
Scneelose runways do not do only the giant mountain residents Sorgenn.
Lack of deters the people also from order of the ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore one can still receive Christmas and New Year's Eve in giant mountains including free room for all.
To our pages people go frequently.
The people go through the offers, state the prices, but meanwhile they are afraid, to order obligatorily.
And if they call us, they ask whether in our this year's will be on snow or "on slush" immediately the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, mentioned.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay exactly in the spindle mill after his ideas should not hesitate anymore with the order.
Who the saving comes with preference and at that the quality of the mission only in second, that one can attempt, a few more wait.
Meanwhile the spindle mill hotel proprietors mainly offer only week stays for the New Year's Eve day.
I think that they will long make an effort for selling these another time, but then also they must give, and pay attention to are, for a.
And then the free will fade away quickly, Jandura estimated.
Be the always offers Ingtours free beds at all winter appointments in Vrchlabi.
Now the Christmas week which meanwhile is not yet sold out interests us the most.
In our offer half of the places is for instance still free.
Therefore we prepared already some more economical Christmas stays for the last, the director of the travel agency of Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, mentioned.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also still offer the New Year's Eve day in giant mountains, but here there is less free.
Good sale find the first fourteen days in, the rest are sold average.
This year the interest is for the winter stays also through that negatively influenced that in giant mountains is still no lies.
The people wait, whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without.
If the runways should be snow-covered within a week this too will be sold out, thinks Schiefert.
Reverse and a little better when in last year it succeeds, to fill the rooms in the horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We lie for instance about five percent better than in the.
On New Year's Eve day and for Christmas we have only a few.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in the, and in the business will work also well, the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel of Rada, informed.
To 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays also the is busy near the central parking place in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand even half of the keeps free for Christmas in the latest hotel in.
Pleasantly January for which we are busy at this time already to around 60 surprised us this year.
The is a little weaker meanwhile, however in the moment if the snow comes climbs determined also the interest at the periods spent in, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, mentioned.
Meanwhile the giant mountain hotel proprietors wait for a greater snow distribution of presents.
On Thursday it should cool off and if it results in fallouts, that should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warming is supposed to come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Meteorological Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Mother of the cleverness is repetition
It is almost funny, with which Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question that he held even for the most stupid.
When he sweated out finally his Afghanistan doctrine in a longing way expected, it was proved, that it copied these about the copying paper from the Busch-Irak-Szenariovor three years.
Not only, that he uses the phrase "so in the text "as in " even repeatedly, he has even the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own: Used "new forward path" without hesitating.
In this case he himself criticized the Bush - idea - to send out fresh troop contingents into the Iraq tormented by the civil war - three years ago as a decision irresponsible and karastrophische in their inferences.
Following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy taking of the as a basis the only possible one and in so far as was very successful, that one does not talk about Iraq anymore at all today in the news.
The call of Bushs improved through that not, because objectively he has his successor a much more thankful initial situation rear - calm, than it was to be expected.
In the Afghanistan Barack Obama hopes for the miracle being repeated.
Around increase of the troop contingent asked it renewed the militaries, particularly the upper commander of the Afghanistan operation general Stanley McCristal that criticized the hesitating shooters even in spite of the subordination habits in the in a hard way.
It claimed 40 000 in order to be able to reverse the situation to the better one.
The president hesitated three months, is but to no better did not come and so he deceived the general wenistens around 10 000.
From Europe he pressed the promise for wider 5.000 even if initially at least he himself reckoned 10.000.
Highly problematic at all this his intention already in 18 months to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan, and to finish this process within three years is. The whole Obama - doctrine leaves behind more questions than.
Some doubt about the halved increase bringing the same as the action in.
Also in spite of the fratricidal war of recent the Iraq - society is relatively well structured, their leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is shaped by the contraindication - one can not rely on Anybody and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions it is heavy to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to change every day their opinion.
The political institutions even if they were founded formally correctly only appearance constructions stay behind which the patriarchal tribe relationships will keep on proliferating there.
The reconciliation of interests between the various ethnic is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the relations that complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences still further.
Also the build of a "state authorized to act" which is the minimum objective of the whole is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama - strategy astonished by his voluntarism
Over the last eight the situation worsened in Afghanistan only further and now it is on the fringe of the.
Only a really romantic soul which can not be impressed from facts can believe in the small soldiers who burst out in the war cry about the "morning homecoming" getting a miracle here.
From the political the date settlement is pure irresponsibility for the troop withdrawal because the Taliban will understand that as the indirect confession of American.
The last NATO - peak showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combats in Afghanistan for the end goes.
Europe's politician can and do not want to declare their voters either in the way in which the security of Germany or Italy is associated with the war in the Hindukusch-Gebirgsvorland.
A further possible factor which can influence the situation radically is the development of in.
The situation would keep on should worsen and not to work the increased onto the Iranians, a very difficult question whether the problem is not to be solved with troops turns out for the United States.
This question must be answered in the period, in America after Obama to the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan strides.
Every solution will mean, however, also a dramatic turn of the Afghan.
The single comfort plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that another three years stay up to the president choice, and thus this remains fallls still enough time so that he can reach for a different than total breakdown would prove.
The managers of the do not receive any Prämienboni anymore in cash
The leading managers of the American do not receive this year any Prämienboni anymore in cash.
That announced the company which reacts to the sharp criticism of their in this way.
A group of 30 top managers receives instead of the money stocks which one, however, may not sell before in five years.
In addition the stocks can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they act riskily excessively.
Goldman Sachs positions himself so next to the forefront of according to the agency of Reuters, to unite the Prämieboni the rampart Street with long-term achievement.
I believe, the former banker of the society JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, mentioned that the rampart Street about the direction going on in which it has to go is conscious.
The problem lies in the details, it added.
Goldman Sachs turned itself into the target of after she had put aside almost 17 billion dollars for the first three quarters of this for Prämienboni.
The total height of the Prämienboni in during the this Jahra will probably exceed 20 billion dollars after the agency of Reuters also in spite of the today indicated measure.
The high Prämienboni in the became the most controversial political with beginning of the financial crisis in a whole from Länders.
Great Britain told on that intends to burden the Boni of the bankers that exceed 25 thousand with a tax of 50 percent uniquely.
Also France prepares similar steps.
This year women gained the Nobel prizes in all departments, excluded in physics.
Five record women have today desKönigs of Swede Carl XVI in from the. Gustaf the this year's Nobel prizes in the compartment categories and for literature taken over.
Next to the four Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was under the German under that.
The Nobel prize for medicine kept for two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for the research in the.

The only compartment category in which this year no woman received a Nobel prize was physics.
The scientists suffered this price today Charles Kao for the research in the and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD Chip invention, that the basis of all, fax machines or astronomical telescopes is.
Each of these winners received the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certification of the acquisition of the.
That one is in every category ten million Swedish crowns.
If there are several winners in every category, the cash price under them is divided up.
Tradition - Appropriately the American president, Barak Obama, received the most expected peace Nobel prize already today afternoon in Oslo.
He acknowledged the Kontrovere of his appointment in his speech because he is first at the beginning of his, and in addition stands at the top of the country that leads two wars - in and in Afghanistan.

President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday early the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his remaining in the government, because it is with the carrying out of the state budget for next year in the, as this through the Assembly was released on was cleared, not einverstanden.
It is accepted that the budget and maybe also the remaining of Janota will be the topics of the Friday meeting in the.
The budget is criticized also by Klaus.
According to it the budget deficit is too high, which keeps on deepening also the crisis of public.
The president speaker, Radim Ochvat, informed of the concurrence.
Janota wants to negotiate about his further staying in his function on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer.
After the Budget-Gesetz,das now Klaus for the signature keeps, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 should manage.
In the parliament the left-wing party proposals for on the were voted on, however, on and the money for the civil servant salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of the farmers increases.
The government objected to the proposals of the, that it screens the budget deficit increase.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political arose therefore, because of that the question mark about the further work of the arises, on whose organization the ODS, CSSD and Green Party member party in the agreed.
Critics say that the budget the way it was accepted by the parliament practically liquidates the parcel of the economy measures which were put through on the part of the fisherman - government in the, and that is supposed to end the state indebtedness according to their sense.
Klaus, who can sign the law about the state budget, however, not must have neglected, declared today during the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs, that the politicians the "serious problem" that represents "the untenable deficit" of public the longer.
In his opinion there is not today not a good.
An improvement could bring only a strong government which for this purpose could still build on a broader consensus of the political.
The ODS chairperson, Mirek Topolanek, performed, that the budget is horrible, and the government should consider their continued.
The ODS putting - chairperson, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the draft of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and greens party does not function obviously anymore.
Prime minister fisherman described in the editorial staff similar words as "strong sayings".
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek words, that the budget deficit is horrible, that had prepared the former government of Topolanek for this year, and that crosses 200 billion crowns.
Already on the CSSD interpreted the approval of the as success for the next year.
Also the people's party was satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new by Clint Eastwood from Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim, that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The unbeaten one" of the world a lot of the country shows, of whose fight and victories in spite of some criticisms, that the title role was filled by an American.
The history tells about sport, race relations and above Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid form of government in the South African Republic as well as their first black, Nelson Mandela,stellt in his biography the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman, dar.
It said to Freeman that he was asked by the ninety-one year old Mandela whether it could represent it in the Eastwood- film.
A further meaningful role takes over check mate Damon.
I said to him: "If I will play you, I must meet you.
The seventy-two year old actor, that the price for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box field "Million dollar baby" had kept, represented already the leader of the movement for of the movement towards the from which became at the to the slave holder, a fictitious USA president, dar and also God in "Evan Allmächtig", however only rarely somebody that still lives and is as important for many people as Mandela.
The former südafrikanischeStaatsmann was 27 years long for his active activity during the termination of the apartheid in the South African Republic in the prison.
It was put in 1990 on free foot undfür four years it became of the.
In the year 1993 it was marked with the Nobel peace prize.
" Invictus " is the roman word for " unbeaten ", and simultaneously that is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley which was published in the year 1875.
The requirement was how it to speak
The film describes a true event in the case of which Nelson Mandela joined his strengths with the captain of the South African Rugby Team, Francois Pienaar, in order to unite the country. The new president Mandela knows that his nation keeps on still race - moderately as well as economically being divided also according to apartheid.
He believes that it can unite his nation through the sport, therefore he decides to unite the rugby players who belong to the mavericks worldwide.
Finally the South African Team climbs up until the World Cup of the year 1995.
Freeman worked several years on in order to bring the Mandela - history onto the cinema canvas.
He did not have no objective other than to play this role so in order to conform these to the reality too as closely as possibly, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge was as a matter of course to speak so as it was.
The actor said if it and the world politician would be in the same it would attempt, to meet Mandela, to eat with it to evening and to be before his speech behind the scenes.
The most important was for it to joggle Mandela the hand.
I found, if I joggle you the hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know which you feel, he said.
For me it is important to have become one other.
Check mate Damon sets in the, captain of the national dar, in which the white have predominated.
The actor said that he had six months of time for the role in the hard rugby world prepare.
It was a great for it when it hit for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang onto the door-bell that it opened and was the first thing that I said to François Pienaar in my life: 'In the film I look much taller'.
In spite of the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual, he has under the orders of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" positive reviews receive and one speaks also of a prospect of.
The film critic of the leaf Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in following words: "That was very good, very good exported film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
Light secret solved above Norway: The Russians tested a missile
Above Norway a special light effect of unknown origin was to be observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defense added only yesterday that close to of the Norwegian an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The start was not successful again, however, and the missile referred to as a type " Bulava " that the pride should be to the pride of the Russian initially will become slow for the nightmare of the Russian Generalität as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the.
Bulava was not started mostly at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian one writes already about " Bulava " than more than one "missile, that" does not " fly ".
A missile which does not fly, however, shines
This already 13th attempt, ran in an at the beginning normal way.
First at the end of the in turn technical occurred at the missile.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third.
This time " Bulava " set off from the atomic - submarine Dmitrij Donskij which drove under the water of in the.
This missile type facilitates the shooting from the submarine.
Therefore the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object is likely in fact about north ways to be the damaged " Bulava ".
Furthermore the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment about it being a question of a Russian.
The Generalität verwahrt diesesmal against that and said that one can not speak of a failure unequivocally.
First two stages of the did not turn out and from the accident first the third stage was affected.
In the previous the engines were damaged now in the first.
Even if no test start without errors occurred, the management of the holds only six of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost fifty per cent success gives therefore optimism to the Generalität and so it keeps on being said that the " Bulava " will fly once without problems and will support even to ten hypersound nuclear warheads with a total weight from Max. 1.15.

Because of overtime arranged frequently the trade union announced on Monday the strike willingness.
The speaker of the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek, confirmed that.
The management still wants to agree, however, on a Saturday shift with the trade unionists in this week.
We must not give up our production plan, that one is a basic principle, therefore became on Saturday, the 19th December, suggested voluntary overtime proposed for the, that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.

Czech discovery: a substance, that also at ´gestaehlten ´ HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German tests new connections that are supposed to stop the spreading of HIV viruses in the.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it works also with the viruses which are resistant already against medicines.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage, that the connection does not act on usual virus variants so strongly, as one of the existing.
The AIDS illness can not be cured yet.
The medicine compilation can prolong, however, the patients the life and prevent the increase of the in the.
Your taking is accompanied, however, from a whole of side effects.
The development sg has incomplete suppression of the virus - increase furthermore. Resistant viruses for the consequence against which no drugs anymore are effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the academy of the sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical - technological college) Prague as well as from the university in opens the way one can deal with the virus resistance.
You proved that the materials referred to as Metalokarborane act on the protein which is responsible for increase of the HIV-Viruses.
The Metalokarborane are connections of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block the virus - increase in another manner as all today used drugs, therefore they can overcome the resistance - problem.
In their work the scientists reach too new ´verbesserten ´ connections that were prepared for the virus protein on basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their link.
The Metalokarborane have a unique tridimensional structure: two vielfächige cages which consist of boron, hydrogen and carbon - atoms and are coupled through a metal - atom, in this case cobalt.
And constant
HIV-Protease is protein of the which is vital for the life cycle of the.
Without the HIV - Virus - split caused through the HIV-Protease tyres could not would arise.
If we scolded the HIV-Protease, we switch off also call on the expansion of the in the body of the, declare the scientists in the press report which was handed over by the for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the academy of the sciences CR.
In the work that in the science newspaper journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published the scientists describe whole series of, in which two pairs of the cages (see table) coupled through a short organic are, that then is changed systematically further.
A little weaker, but more reliable
Tested the effect of this row of materials against the HIV-Protease wurdne in the, also against their continuous (resistant) variants that were gained by HIV-infizierten patients.
The effect of the Metalokarborane onto the usual enzyme variant is not so strong, as near the clinically used drugs, however, she does not lose their effect on the resistant variants against which the used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism as well as their further characteristics, such as biological and chemical, low toxicity and possibility wider chemical organizations, the Metalokarboranen turns into interesting connection for wider focused on the development of effective against HIV research, Pavlina Rezacova says, head of the laboratory for the for organic and biochemistry's and the institute's for molecular genetics of the academy of the sciences.
Quarrel because of budget. ODS went for fishermen, that one defends himself
The chairperson of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as " horrible " and the government of prime minister of Jan Fischer should consider their continued in his opinion.
By the referred to the comment of the ODS as "strong sayings".
Time is let supposedly for the analysis.
The deputy ODS - chairperson, Petr Necas, said that the draft of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and greens party does not function obviously anymore.
According to Necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to count on the minority in the parliament if it is a question of the fight against the rising, or whether it is a question of his remaining for him in the office with the aid of the parliament left wingers.
The approaching of the and the social democrats onto the issue of public is diametral deviating, Necas referred to that.
The parliament has on the budget for the year 2010 angenommen,allerdings with link party amendments above more than 12 billion crowns.
The parliament increased the money onto the farmers for civil servant salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments.
The government objected to the proposals put forward by the, that it screens the budget deficit increase.
Czechia should manage with a backlog of 163.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so it complied with the wish of the, because also the changed budget is only one little bad variant of the. not clear
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, talked about his disappointment and a feeling of the senselessness against which prime minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government still judges the current.
Necas is convinced, that, if Janota would have threatened with his resignation seriously for the case, that the proposals for alteration would be accepted, the situation different would look.
According to the Czech television Janota enrolled itself for Monday to the government business with the prime minister.
It pointed out, that it considers his further remaining in the office.
Reason for that is his disappointment over the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent Fischer speaks out for the further fight with the budget - deficit, the Nominanten of the social democracy (CSSD) which the changes in the had put through in the government do not have to do anything in this way according to Necas.
The prime minister should say that he will resign if the parliament accepts laws keeping on deficit - increasing also clear for example to affect that one, that one sick pay and pensions or the service law novelette.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
That is thing of the prime minister of fishermen and the whole.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any errors, emphasized Topolanek in a text message from the USA.
Mentioned that in deputy function people that stand up for TOP 09 that voted against the budget are in some ministries.
Necas stressed, that, if fisherman darür decides, to renounce the fight against the deficit height of public, "it is completely logical and correct that it is based on the link majority that currently is in the ".
Then it supposedly with the support and tolerance of the not can reckon.
I did not think about that, and if that will be current, I will occupy myself with that then, said the defense minister Martin Bartak nominated by the civil democrats to the journalists in the parliament.
Prime minister fisherman flew in the afternoon onto the meeting of the European Council in.
The ODS went down at the request of the
Necas stressed simultaneously that the ODS would probably vote against the changed budget on Wednesday in the if the prime minister asked expressly the members of the for their facilitating the adoption of the.
We do not occur to ourselves as orphans, we are not small, so it reacted then to the question whether the ODS was not zurückgedrängt about the budget by absence of the party chairperson during the political negotiations in the parliament as well as in the Czech Republic.
I did not notice that my voice would be missing.
Already when I renounced the mandate, I knew, that it would be a question particularly of Bolschewisierung of the parliament and destruction of everything for positives in next months, reacted Topolanek itself.
After the new timetable of records (Czech railways) less trains go for approximately the same fare.
Ended The Czech Railroad or restricted from 13th December little unites occupied quickness and local trains, on the other hand other connections are intensified.
The entire traffic extent is lowered from the validity day of new in comparison with today at 2.
Most rates including base and customer going - rates does not change.
For instance, are receiving the inhabitants of the receive several connection possibilities into the capital, the railroad uses trains of the type Pendolino for this stretch.
The express train will not go anymore to Bratislava (Bratislava).
Less express trains will drive Budweis also on the stretch - in principle -, fundamentally the direct connections are reduced by Prague according to Letohrad.
The railroad plans the greatest reduction in the district Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz) as a whole, to an 8, on the other hand Prague and surroundings can look forward to a rise.
Are canceled also two night trains on the stretch Prague - Tabor - of Budweis and onto some days weekdays the company of some express trains is reduced on the stretch Prague - Pisek - of Budweis.
For the greatest the introduction of the new belongs from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants must change from Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is a question of the fifteenth traffic route of the suburban traffic system Esko whose opening is possible thanks to the railroad electrification from Lysa nad Labem according to Milovice.
The distance reaching - stretches into the capital become in the Prague target station - central station end.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive in the from two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers can not go since 13th December to Bratislava anymore.
This year's bill for regional railroad: Rise around 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid by the, in total the railroad for the settlement receives of the so-called liquidity loss' into that one next year four billion Kronen,genaus as in this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they pay for that in next year eight billion crowns at which the state fires three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains the railroad signed a ten year contract again, until now the contract was always signed only for a year.
The railroad praises the system, maybe she did not reach also therefore for the price increase with the great majority of the.
To changes CD Net comes it only near one-day net tickets and near favorable internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card the CD price is increased to Net from 450 crowns on 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will depend then on the driven Stecke, until now it was homogeneous for the journey between arbitrary district cities and it tasted 160 crowns.

Against Michal Hasek from the south Moravia district, Radko Martinek from the district Pardubice and the conductor of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty - minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is connected with the effort of the to practice the regional rail traffic in some districts.
Finally all regions signed, however, the long-term contracts with that one of Czech Railroad.
All three conductors attack us and say, that we remove the raisins, at how it was agreed on with them we presented the offer only about the extent.
You say that we are expensive as the Czech Railroad because we would know the prices of the which were finished former week.
So nothing else remains for us than to defend oneself.
Because of this defamation of student Agency, Jancura said to the radio journal.
Simultaneously he mentioned that he has proofs from all districts that they did their steps in agreement with the Europe right.
Therefore we prepare an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the collection of the for the further continuation of the Medialshow of Jancura which serves it for his society as well as for its own as free advertising.
I am to defend my good name as well as the good name of my readily as a matter of course, and I call also further conductors for that.
I accept that also with this matter it will become clear that it is Jancura which manipulates the public in the thing of the regional unity railway traffic and uses false arguments and untrue, said Hasek.
Jancura told already last week that he invested several millions of crowns in the advertising which will refer to the harmful step the.
He said to the radio journal that it suspends the campaign after Christmas, and wants to carry on these after New Year.

The campaign discharged Jancura after the districts agreed on operation of the regional rail traffic with the Czech Railroad and for the remit at a high ones had not written out any announcements around 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura one such is illegally and in conflict with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism at criticism of the movement of trains in the already a member of the threatened him, according to Jancura.

Inoculation against Pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual thing.
They is supposed to be when first for the families free and voluntary.
But already now voices announce to themselves that the duty - inoculation would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against culminate.
The medicine institute sets already the maximum prices of the vaccines which must pay the health insurances.
The experts realize also the inoculation procedure.
New inoculation
Vaccines free for August children
From January children can be vaccinated freely against Pneumokokken, that on 2nd August of last year and late were given birth.
The condition st that they did not receive yet any vaccinating - dose.
Who with the inoculation already in last year or formerly has begun, also weitereWiederholungsimpfung herself must pay.
The first vaccinating - dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th life month of the.
Already former year a quarter of the made vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the recent four cans are necessary.
As a whole, the experts reckon that the health insurances spend 300, 000 to 450, 000 per for the vaccinating - cans.
You save, however, during the treatment which the children without would need.
Until now the state issued approx. 500.000 for all face inoculations of the children per annum.
The duty inoculation was introduced with that so-called Janota parcel.
Pneumokokken cause inflammation of the middle ear, however also difficult infections including meningitises and blood poisoning.
Through Pneumokokkeninfektionen up to 28 children die with us after in hospitals per in the age to 10 years.
Outside of Czechia the duty - inoculation of the children was introduced against in some 40.
Will the inoculation be duty?
Simultaneously it is said that this inoculation could be duty in the future.
From January should these of the insurances pays and to be voluntary.
The head of the mentioned example - wisely that the duty inoculation would be better near, Rudolf Kalovsky, read.
His union advertises the Pneumokokken - inoculation already on a long-term basis.
The specialists on the international conference at which our union was shared were not very satisfied with our having voluntary inoculation.
That is not very ideal.
On the Other Hand we are glad that we succeeded in putting that through at least.
I believe, Kalovsky mentioned that is the way that we must go now.
The Department of Health, Education and Welfare does not want to change, however, the vaccinating - procedure against Pneumokokken.
Right Now we do not consider that at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary inoculation has their disadvantages, say the doctors.
The chairperson of the compartment society of practical child specialists, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary has their disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think then about the decrease of the "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive we understand the political, that this inoculation was started than voluntary", allerdingst Cabrnochova says.
The experts expect that more than 80 % of make their babies be vaccinated against Pneumokokken off next year.
The inoculation against Pneumokokken is epoch-making also in that, that this is paid as first face inoculation of the health insurances and not of by the.
The insurances should spend the money for the prevention, they economize on that for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
In this way is, however, united a worry of the practical that affects the purchase of.
According to the original the vaccines should be bought through the insurances and to keep the doctors these then on the same, as also others of the state onto them distributed vaccines.
Unites representative feared, however, that the insurances so "the money from that one could Health Insurance - Lead.
Therefore the doctors will buy and will maintain will have the vaccines themselves until these pay them the insurances.
After the estimates the single practical doctors monthly will have to invest 40 000, which is a significant.
That will not become simple at all, says Cabrnochova.

Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and in a secular.
In a time in which Swiss voters voted for a construction prohibition for minarets and the concern is widespread about the alleged islamisation of John Bowen an American, wrote a thorough and well-considered about that, whether Muslims into one can be integrated the erklärtermassen säkularisiertesten societies Europe's - and are integrated.
Some readers become This new from admiration for the final document of the: "Why the French do not love any head scarves" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) read, a study of a dispute that divided the country over one and a half decades and that employed and their effects are to be perceived also today still elegant and arguing thickly.
Bowens newest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist he would only not like to know what the politicians and the media say about the Islam in France but what really happens on the field.
He transferred months into mosques, schools and Instituten, that now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen names "Islamic open spaces" offer.
He is a good, he expresses debates between teachers and on the which worry her the most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be informed of evolution and rights of the homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a, a non-Muslim,?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest - oriented banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly more down-to-earth, he says, that define the daily life, completely unlike the political dramas that employ the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a names, possibly except for Tarik Ramadan, an Arabian - Muslim scholar born in The and academic.
This new generation attempts on the one hand to be a good and, on the other hand, a good in a modern secular to open up the debate above that how it is possible.
You do not have all arguments on their page.
The conservatives are mistrustful of the idea of a French or European.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen consulted are mostly uneins with their Salafi counterparts - advocates of the purist sunnitischen Islam that is connected to Saudi Arabia - that nowadays show a small, but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an accord requires a giving and taking on both pages.
He sets into consideration, to what extent French political (and the intellectual elite, guarded the so passionate one the separation from church and state) the pluralism obliged really feel.
It points out that Muslims find out possibly a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews that had to do their historical compromise with the secular republic aniseed pulp for her part.
He rather recognizes a "sharpening of the value screws" than a growing.
Can the Islam be French? After the reading of this one is inclined say "Really, but not yet".

Pakistan government representatives uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistan authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy that it aimed at that to send five men from north Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope, this case could help dabei to uncover an extensive terrorist recruiters that search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Observers said that they had searched a devious insurgent, confessed as Saifullah, that had invited the men to Pakistan after it had made it ausfindig because comments agreeing to one of them on the internet video page YouTube on terrorist attacks had given.
Saifullah became according to their arrival in Pakistan of the leader of this and attempted to help them with reaching the remote field in Pakistan's tribe belts, that the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist is.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service which was informed about the matter said on Saturday Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida-Führer of the men not being a part of a CIA - conspiracy for to infiltrate the terrorist.
As a consequence they were held over days in the eastern part of the, far from the inhospitable mountains in the which became a terrorist refuge place.
You were looked as a part of one concealed operation.
Therefore they were refused, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to of the sensitivity of the.

Demanding tens of thousands demonstrators in Copenhagen Klima-"Action"
Tens of thousands demonstrators marched here through the streets on and demanded bolder action from the agents in the Bella congress center of the city with the climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100 000 had followed the event wohingegen the police estimates rather of about 25.000 went out.
The event proceeded relatively peacefully although a handful of activists dressed up ignited small exploding - bodies near of some government buildings in the.
On a day, when at the climate negotiations supported by the UNO little happened, thousands of activists with banners wandered through the city, on which in English stood "It does not add any planet" and one in Spanish, that declared "The earth says " Enough ".
Some stars followed the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen that said that the journeys do to her consciously to Peru, the birth country of their mother, which heartbreaking problems the country has to fight with due to the already perceptible effects of the climate change.
That is of the why I decided to participate in the major - in order to pass on the word and, to appeal to the world leaders to achieve a fair, ambitious and binding, she said.
It is not an easy, but it must be done now and it more that led round for that does not give any way.
The police kept the demonstrators from that, too to approach near at the Bella center and it mainly said they would have arrested 19 persons due to the fact that they were either dressed up or carried along jackknives.
According to Danish law these actions are prohibited in the case of demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named since it is involved in the climate negotiations demonstrators dressed up ignited several exploding - bodies in black clothing near the Copenhagen primary channel in whose proximity there are several ministries.

But the protest has the awareness of the, as Su As, China's chief climate agents, not reached apparently.
When it was asked, he replied to English whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive effect on the international: "That is something, whose I was me" not at all conscious".
He went on then with Mandarin and said: "Because the place of event is big, I can not hear what happens outside".
He stated that it depends on the perspective of the whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the concentration of the general and of various onto the topic of the climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they interrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other ".
Examination data show stubborn race fissure
The reports to the mathematics achievement were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington district lies still far behind the schools of the that produce maximum performances, the reports show, that the Fourth- and Achtklässler into that one last two years faster progress than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York did.
What, however, in the latest figures from the of the education progress' (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) included is, the persistent is between Afro-American and white pupils, both on local, as also nationally a level.
The average dot number of the white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. increased to both years in the last ones to 270 from 262 (on a scale of 500), which climbed to their Afro-American of the same age however only around three points of 209 on 212.
The achievement fissure climbed in reality from 53 onto 58 points in between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American Achtklässler remained basically now, it fell around a statistically negligible point on 244 from 245.
The average dot number of white pupils was not received into the test datum since the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six season room is not also encouraging.
The fissure, the white and black Viertklässler 2003 separated when the first NAEP was understood in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the dot number which of both achieved in this time span grew the difference with now has hardly been reduced 58 was hardly reduced.
Some education proponents of the district expressed last week their concern on the results which were celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty to for the most being driven forward by white pupils who are in any case already efficient children.
This which is problematic and difficult points out that we raised the total evaluation through the treatment of those ones at the top end of the said Jeff Smith of the board of. Voice a voluntary, that for the education equality in Washington D.C. kicks in.
I do not jump for a gap from two or three points and, said the democratic Washington town council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton elementary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee who is a message of the, said that the secondary schools need urgent attention to the require attention urgently.
One would like to see the positive natural, I respect that.
What frightens me, however, is, that we not approximating the time and to spend energy that we would have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue finding better ways in order to be raked to the needs of the inefficient pupils.
In this fall for example, a number are trained in using a new reading curriculum, the Wilson - vintage - system, that is aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, did not master at the start of its and that dates back significantly behind their classmates of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum which moves games and lifelike experiences into the foreground from the kindergarten up to the sixth was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey and some of the NAEP - progress which were told last week are ascribed to this curriculum.
I think that we keep on having to work on making the best measures to lie under the note level benefit the pupils, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight it the question whether Rhee can leave with that to correct the performance of the economy of the and in this case furthermore the additional money and the resources for the inefficient schools availably can put, that are notwenig in order to reduce the fissure.
This is a serious for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor, for education at the University of California in Berkeley who examines urban examination results.
The conventional remedy consists in focusing his resources and management reforms on the schools that in the poorest areas of. are.
The aim could cause political after-effects which work against this important.
The weak point is natural, as with other urban, that she attempts to hold the white and black middle class.
Our focus consists in guaranteeing that we establish a system of great.
We must fortify our schools in the quarters, in this way all families, independent of that, where they live to be able to be, secure that their children can receive an excellent public.
Janey who now is a school inspector in Newark said this week, said in an that one of the most significant elements for the closure of the consists in prolonging the traditional public school year which is currently 180 days in Washington in order to compete with the charter - schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 in order to have the power to said Janey that came to an agreement with his teacher trade union last year over 185 days per annum that he considers as "a milestone" on the way for a greater increase in the next.

Until recently also Graciela who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale had never put a foot on a college - campus.
Your attitude and that of the other Achtklässler of the group that Gettysburg, where the teaching per costs 38.690 dollars find out was rather that of a reverential visitor, when that of an enthusiastic future.
"Yes! Here I" will soon " be "! Graciela called who would like to study medicine gladly when the leader announced that they had entered the building now for natural sciences.
"Wow, really"? she said thoughtfully when the low Professor-zu-Studenten-Verhaeltnis of the school was told to her.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which the children visited on their three day long tour and now they completely incorporated the intended message: The question is not, whether one goes auf's college.
The question is, where.
On the one hand a wachsende concern exists about the great number of the children of hispanischer immigrants that do not end the Highschool or become pregnant as teenagers born in the USA, on the other hand there are, however, also Hunderttausende that receive the college training that is necessary in order to climb up into the middle class.
In truth the college closes to one from five of this "second generation" from Hispanoamerikaner - what a remarkable achievement is, there many of their immigrated parents, to have closed mostly from Mexico or Zentralamerika into which USA came without the Highschool.
Your success histories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation which will play a major with the workforce of the.
Those ones who examine efficient children say these have often a natural affinity for the school and a drive being inherent in them to the success.
Many of them have also parents that set their children high objectives and find ways in order to compensate their lack of familiarity with American.
But consultation programs play also play a major, when they Graciela and millions of children as they help with coming to in the especially if these efforts live on over long periods.
To help them through the system, when one considers income - weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills, during the way search, then a single measure to some time or another will not solve the problem either, Patricia Gándara, researcher, said at the University of California in Davis that examined hispanoamerikanische students.
We must think about that, for these children a supporting network of the preschool to provide through the Highschool.
The federal program that Gracielas had financed college - tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - to shift up A Walk - and that one provides more than 300 million dollars per annum for local educational systems in order to start college preparation programs to begin if income - weak pupils are in the middle school and weiterlaufen until they finished the Highschool.
According to the US Department of the program has helped since 1999 to more than 10 million pupils from which more than 60 % went onto in the.
Iraqi oil ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign
In spite of objections because of power and political instability it had been able to bring the Iraqi government for this purpose in the case of two auctions finished on Saturday larger oil societies to reconstruct his damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts of the Iraqi signed with foreign oil societies advise that China, Russia and European oil enterprises are ready to play an important role during the renovation of Iraqi that is paralyzed by war and economic sanctions since decades.
American enterprises could credit only parts of two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American enterprises had paid for the participation in the second that began on Friday.
The only enterprise which gave a commandment pulled the shorter one.
Two American enterprises could sign contracts for fields auctioned in.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multis during the opening up of the Iraqi surprised the analysts.
Iraq opened war final after 6 years his gates and instead of US enterprises Asiatic give and European the way before, Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news agency, said.
There will not be long no further in.
Security objection, that were still underlined by massive coordinated bombardments on and said American oil societies probably kept the political instability through the withdrawal of the from that, so analysts, to commit oneself more strongly in the Iraq that has the third - biggest proved crude oil reserves of the world.
US companies were in some cases put at a disadvantage because competitors, particularly the and other from a government viewpoint controlled energy enterprises, have significantly lower and rather accept risks because they must lay down stockholders do not.
Exxon - Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. the single American enterprises that could sign contracts with the ministry were.
Greater US enterprises, as chevron and ConocoPhillips that maintain narrow relationships with the Iraqi and stood in the last years with technical council to the page ended emptily.
The Russian enterprises Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists at two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state China National petroleum corporation offered for more contracts, as any other and could go with big parcels at for two major home.
We know all, the speaker of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, said that China is on the way to become one of the large ones of the as well as a technology power.
We are convinced, that the Chinese can compete against his Mitbietern and will fulfill its obligations with regard to.
Enterprises elected for the commandment delivery gave commandments that then were compared with the fee per barrel oil that the ministry was ready to pay in order to increase the output of every Felds beyond the current.

US Verteidigungsminister Gates: Iran must reckon additional sanctions
It told defense minister Robert M. Gates Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in conversations about his atomic plans.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 during a 7 - day long journey through the war fields in Afghanistan and in north Iraq and played the prospect onto a military action against the Islamische Republik Iran.
In Iran no good are selectable, he said with regard to the probability of such in response to the question of.
"The Unvorhersagbarkeit, typical of the war, is one of the things which suit to me on the soul if we learned something in the last six from the. "
The Obama - government takes a sanction parcel which is aimed at the military and political elite of into consideration, but Gates announced that a number could affect also affect the.
He said that a "parcel at positive and negative " is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with in fact less", because "their nation" suffers " enormous " under the sanctions.
On Friday the American followed the European top politicians in a comment from the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, in the warning, that Iran must reckon " plausible " consequences if it does not follow the requirements of the and his atomic supervision organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with his atomic program.
Iran keeps on saying that Iran continues to claim that the is supposed to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In the case of conversations in Geneva on 1st October of said that it would resume the conversations for on restriction of its and would renounce a significant part of their at enriched uranium in the exchange for urgently needed nuclear combustible for his medical.
The US government insisted on this kind from agreement in order to establish the confidence between the two and to win time for negotiations.
Iran seems to have quit, however the negotiations on the subject of the interim since this time - partially, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is uneins over whether they should sign up opposite the United States.
That Iran made the international community with respect to some proposals which they had already agreed to at the beginning of October simply stand has, openly said, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way said gates.
President Obama set the 31 as a period of time for Iran, to weiterverfolgen onto these proposals to react before he mentioned other options " sanctions " overwhelming " the exterior minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once, including those ones, becomes.
In a comment given in New York the Iranian representation condemned near the United Nations what she mentioned on Thursday and said "unfathomable and unsound claims" of some Security Council members for the Iranian that they are ready to continue the conversations with the United States and five other "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term ".
Gates, who should return to Washington on last Friday, met at the morning the Iraqi prime minister Nuri al-Maliki before he flew into the oil - rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authority representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in keep on being high, in the special one with respect to borders, owner permission and because of the distribution of public.
Gates pushed both pages, the conflict potential to lower, in order to prevent delays of the US plans to lower the American force level from 115.000 until end August on 50.000.
Gates also attempted to disperse the Kurdish concern about the imminent troop withdrawal. US representatives quoted Gates, who said Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish, too: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a United.
We will not leave you."
A course change in the China getting older
Wang Weijia and their husband grew up surroundedly from propaganda posters that held lectures for them that "Mutter Erde is too tired, in order to maintain further children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
They learned these lessons so well, that, to change the course as government officials in Shanghai that began through the low and the population getting older in this summer suddenly and young pairs encouraged their answer to having more than one immediately and finally was: " in No Case".
We invested already all our and energy in a child.
For a second nothing is more remaining, a personnel head with an 8 - month said to Wang, 31, old son.
A population crisis pulls up more than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child - politics to China which produced two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled only children who are mentioned lovedly "small emperors" in the.
The average birth rate is onto 1,8 children per compared to 6 at the moment of when this politics came into force, fallen the UNO- sets
Department of population questions firm, during the number of the of 60 years and older in the year 2020 of 16,7 percent of the population up to the year 2050 on 31,1 percent explosive is supposed to go up. This lies far about the global average of around 20.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coast cities with formed population, as Shanghai.
Last year formed 60 - year and older people almost 22 percent of the announced inhabitants of Shanghai while the birth rate was lying under a child per pair.
Xie Lingli, head of the Stadtbevölkerungs- and Familienplanungskomission said that pairs must agree with babies in the procreative age in order to help "with lowering the relation of the population parts becoming older and easing the Labour shortage to alleviate the ".
Shanghai "is not" soon "so old, however, - so rich - "as the industrialized countries, as Japan and Sweden,", she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Anchored in the constitution of the in 1978, China's one - child - politics might be presumably the most controversial decree to be introduced by the ruling Communist party until today.
Married couples that offend against this politics must reckon enormous fines - up to its triple salary in some - and with in their.
Chinese state representatives ascribed to this politics that the critical demand of natural could be avoided against which human rights representatives condemned abuses during the implementation of.
In rural regions some officials have to drive away pregnant ones who had already a child, forced.
Many pairs which an unnaturally high relation of men to women arose through had made carry out in addition sex - selective abortions.
In the last years government representatives weakened their attitude for the one - child - politics for population in a step by step way.
In 2004 they approved more exceptions to the - including city-dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases, in which both husband, than was also wife Einzelkinder - and in 2007 the tone of many hard was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the institute for population research of the Peking university said that government representatives discussed even about more radical changes recently for example, to allow pairs two children, at which a partner Einzelkind is.
Shanghai became in the first Chinese city to start an aggressive campaign to from more births.
Posters that families informed of having only to have a were replaced almost overnight from guidelines that describe who comes for a second into consideration and how one can apply for the permission detailed.
The municipal administration sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning in order to consult pairs at home and to durchschieben information leaves among the doors.
She asked also for providing psychological and financial consultation for those ones that has more than a.
The reaction was just not encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials said from a rural small town in the external areas of Shanghai that an upswing is to be recognized with the requests of pairs that want a second after the launch of the urban districts want to speak against it do not announce any change.
Near the municipality Huinan with a number of inhabitants of 115.000 only four or five enter as example still monthly.
Disappointed Shanghaier officials say that one will still be near approx. 165.000 for number of the births expected in 2010 in the city in spite of the - a little higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
It said to Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghaier Gemeinde Caolu, that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
You want to give their First the best thing, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would have two children gladly and this is also legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only an insignificant sick person and life insurance of the.
Without a safety, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
In the interpret the one - child - politics as a human being legal question wrongly, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is full of their first in the seventh.
Yes, one robs us of the possibility to have more than one.
The problem does simply not lie, however, in a politics.
The problem is money.
Other pairs indicate for psychological reasons give your.
Wang, the personnel head, said she would like just a because she was also an only child. "We were the centre of the and lived, that everyone took care of us.
We are not accustomed it, to see to others and do not want this either really."
Chen Zijian, a 42 - year long one which a translation enterprise belongs to said it more bluntly.
For parents from the middle class with double career through which the birth rate sinks, he said, it is about that successfully be and for that one must be egoistic.
The age-group of the ones today 20- to 39 - year long increased, to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese and they do not want as a under any circumstances for themselves, he said.
He said, also a single child, makes gigantic requirements on the time of.
A mother must give up their social life at least for two years.
Then there is the room question - "One must rebuild his apartment" - and the life planning - "If the child is 9 months old, must one already a course of life for the best ready have."
Most of his friends are ready, this to carry on a time, Chen said, however not two times.
Our generation is the First to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to bring too many.
UNO - group projects plan for the emission reduction
The climate conference supported through the UNO - that was characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations until now - set on Friday with the publication of a again an emphasis that records for next 40 an ambitious lowering of the hothouse gases in the case of which the industry nations would have to shoulder the biggest loads in the near future.
The text showed that could supply the basis for a final political agreement for the regulation of the hothouse gases both the remaining, how well as the forward shown.
However it was regarded as an important progress in some negotiations that runs out of the time there next week more than 100 leaders from all over the world in Copenhagen will arrive.
The text that was formulated by a UN team especially created for that remains silent about the money supply, the rich countries should give to the poor should give, in this way these short- and to be able to master the global warming on a long-term basis.
He offers also a palette for the key questions at options, including how Industry- and to be able to confine big newly industrialized countries their carbon output and as highly the upper limit value of global should be that the political would bear.
A great deal is given to the process, according to John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who projected which has given them six pages, reached one 180 pages put together negotiation text in order to put what the leading climate protection representative of the UNO, Yvo de Bör, referred to as "the great whole" into the center.
It shows the outline of a possible descendant with whom the industry nations would lower their emissions together by between 25 % and 45 to 2020, in comparison with the limit values of 1990, while bigger developing countries were reducing their emissions by 15 to 30 in the same period.
Together the countries could lower the emissions by 50 % and 95 to 2050.
The European Community gave an impetus to the conversations furthermore on Friday through their assertion, to provide over the next three years 3,6 billion United States dollars per annum in order to support poorer countries in adapting oneself to the effects of the climate change - of the Master the floods' and droughts' to avoid the deforestation.
The Friday brought in spite of that the same verbal fireworks which had determined the conversations in the last week.
The American climate sonder representative Todd Stern refused formulations, that obligatory lowerings of the hothouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for bigger newly industrialized countries, demand if these are not financed by the industry nations.
This train announced that the Obama - government drives a tougher line with than representatives of the Bush administration is not more than two did.
The United States will not sign any agreement without larger newly industrialized countries getting up and without their taking measures so star that complained also about that, that the text goes not far enough, to guarantee that the lowerings could be confirmed also by external.
Star gave his comment an hour according to the declaration of the Chinese, that one said that the leading American climate agent lacks "the reason" either or it was "highly irresponsibly" from it that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help financially China with mastering the global warming.
Through the future economic direction of the major standing on the game have themselves both within the industry nations, than found to edge lines also between the industry nations and the newly industrialized countries.
The current fight refers equally to the rescue of individual, than also onto the rescue of the planet near which China and the United States feud because of their respective while poorer countries are claiming that the two dozen most influential countries the scientific would ignore, to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegatee from Costa Rica, even said that it is not surprising that the major fight for who should bear the costs for the slowing down of the there affected countries for this purpose are passed, more aggressively at making the countries with very high hothouse gas delivery for their actions responsible to go on.
This is very clearly a game which a new economic will develop from, according to Ulate which people are active in Mexico and Central America also as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International.
Some of the countries which are exposed to the effects of climate change are the most declared that they would keep on fighting for a legally binding treaty would fight in although the leading participants say that the talks in the best will lead to a political.
The alliance of the small developing island countries with 43 members presented at the start a 24 - sided contract draft.
"Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international for the European Commission, said" that the offensive of the small "exerts political pressure on the entire political in part therefore because they are now united and demand measures from the newly industrialized countries, as China and India.
The conversations got a new when the delegatees concentrated on the fact that most open questions must still be clarified before the arrival of the in order to come for an agreement.
Hochrangige representatives, as the Indian environmental minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese entstiegen their airplanes and rest through the walks of the Bella center to meetings behind shut doors and press conferences in order to mark out claims that are discussed during the next.
Sheer scale of the - 13 000 enter daily in the and from, guitar - playing activists organize nocturnal shows, in which they do over the countries merry, that to betray oneself in their opinion and to sell, and to become contract drafts from hand to hand instead of passed on by E-Mail - already passed - represents a represents.
The intensity just establishes itself first: all the important are now here and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to proceed to the, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president, for global politics of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights come.
Great Britain's first 225 k.p.h. fast train defines the Monday feeling again
At 5 p.m. on Monday morning 13 will penetrate a whistle the darkness in order to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in the traffic in Great Britain.
The first high speed commuter train in the will reach k.p.h. during his flash journey of Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, lady of Kelly Holmes will go then from London on board of the first.
He hopes, that the new service Great Britain end - finally will connect to an international railway system of fast, reliable trains and will tie up the major the Midlands, of the and Scotland's at London.
The neglected province could become live commuter city, work journey times would be reduced radically and the change of airplane and car to the railways would reduce the national carbon emissions and the jams on the streets.
In the theory the three main believe in this vision.
But the many billions British pound, that are necessary for the construction of a new national, the unavoidable and apprehensions above environmental damage could still grow the brake near the British high speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), an enterprise based in that is supposed to present a feasibility study to the government, lord of Adonis will present the report according to the Times on 30th December.
Through that he receives a detailed stretch card of the next planned stage of the high speed railway system.
The new railroad line, that London with the west Midlands is supposed to unite, will move past with a margin of five urban fields and places, where the effects on the environment are controversial.
In the free ground the plan will show the draft within a distance of 25 metres from the final.
HS2 is supposed to create also for also three for a high speed railway system bigger, leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will react in the to that.
The preferred suggested option is a Y - shaped routing, at which a single high speed stretch would lead to the west Midlands.
The stretch would split in or near of Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"Being the option functioning best seems", said a railroad - insider.
After the finishing the travel time would be reduced between London and to two 40 minutes.
The first stage not to be opened before 2025 would make it for the travellers possible, the stretch of in 49, to be compared with today, to go a little more than an, to put back.
The drafts would offer the trains the possibility to go from 400 k.p.h. with a speed through which that the British would become the fastest Europe's.
The first stretch was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity can drive from 1.100 persons on that.
To 18 could be London-Birmingham in operation per hour on the stretch.
This would mean in turn that in London a terminal on which 20 000 could be attended to per hour was necessary.
Faced with of the space limitations in the it is expected that an existing railway station would be extended in order to put the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce, whether this plan should be continued in his opinion or not, to mean, however, the laborious public consultation and planning measures that a final decision will not be made before after the parliament choices.
But even if it gets the wheels going, the railway system must be built in sections.
The trains would have to change first onto existing rail stretches from the high speed stretches in the from Birmingham, through which the travel time would keep on being near over three between London and Scotland.
This is regarded as a decisive crack point so that a change can be guaranteed by from air to a beacon for the.

When an activist dug protest in Duncans lawns a hole in the form of a after it had become known that he had demanded 4 000 pound (4 500 Euro) over three years.
When it was questioned last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was both of the Fees Office, as also following of Legg for on the approved."
He still added: No debate exists about elusiveness and winding or a buckling of the rules or Similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves severely within the rules, is approved and everything.

Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very known in In the.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, on a few days in front of her death in operates, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine in which he practised to this time.
In 2007 he had operated in the same way on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, to resorb in order to a brain bleeding.
He is, however, also a doctor with doubtful call, that already repeatedly due to unsuccessful operations and not to forget, because of Steuerhinterzug and fraud, was condemned.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical association, called him "a man without scruples who has to justify himself " regularly " to the chamber executive board and is "everything else than recommendable".
After a few days of Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a declaration on Friday over his attorney, Me David Koubbi.
This declared the intervention would have proceeded perfectly and the post-functional investigations would have been " normal ".
The operation did not "cause any bleedings and no drainage requires therefore", he added.

The party alliance UDF (Union for the French democracy) becomes vigorous and asks the party Nouveau Centre not to use their seal anymore
The party alliance that party MoDem is controlled by François Bayrou's reacted on Friday onto a takeover attempt of the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, vonseiten of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, hard and asked it on penalty of a judicial not to use this seal on any document more.
His intention announces to Hervé Morin in public to take over this UDF - seal since he thinks that François Bayrou would not be worthy.
The defense minister whose party partner is the UMP wanted after all this strategy on Saturday in front of the national council of the NC to confirm.
For the emphasis of his efforts he had kept the support of the representative Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC), that raises a claim to the property of the, there it when first this brand 2004 near the " institute " has applied "national de la propriété industrial".
However the business place broke of the of François Bayrous's friends controlled party alliance's UDF the silence and made understand clearly, not to use this seal more and to assign her the property rights of the, that they could not be expropriated and set the minister as well as the members under the threat of a judicial a period of time.
You gave in the last a number of, that you would suggest to your political movement, that writings signed to UDF-Siegelzu +übernehmen+, the centrist wrote in one, by 19 of the 24, under that François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem as well as the senator Jean Arthuis of the zentristischen alliance.
You also believed presumably, you would have to make the right, the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + the present UDF +, on their political as well as on the start page of your web site be printed.
As you know, you do not have any right to use this, the Secretariat of the declared and the party NC asks, "immediately the mention of the name UDF of all material as well as of to remove (theirs) Website".
In addition one demanded of Hervé de Charette ", To Claim - Entitle the property rights of the at their legal transfer".
If you refuse this, we will raise complaint against you, in order to provide the law respect and in order to defend the legitimate rights of the, the signatories warned.
In their writing they stress, that "UDF "since in 1978 a genuine political movement is and remind of that, that morin and his friends "the choice struck these 2007 have to leave in order to base a competing as it others 2002 had already done in order to found the party " UMP ".
The Nouveau centre party used therefore, according to the signatories, no rights, the UDF seal (pour la démocratie française).
You keep on reminding, that the last congress of the UDF 2007 the three year long entry to the as well as the foundation of an office to the defense of "the material and moral interchimneys" of the movement based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, said goodbye has.
Concerned something Hervé de Charette, the office continues so, "it was at the moment of, than he applied for the brand name, already since three years no more member of the " but the UMP.
He profits in scandalous and fraudulent way, of the absence of the storing of the acronym UDF, in order to carry this out for himself.
You keep on giving to consider that this thoughtlessness is on the best to change into a crime, and ionize the strategy of the: Nevertheless it seems more dignified to us in the politics as also in the life to make a name instead of attempting to come from the anonymity when one acquires, in fraudulent way a name, onto which one any legal claims" does not " have ".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is condemned because of exploitation of weakness
The court of justice of Nanterre decided on Friday on judging the artist François-Marie Banier in order to find out whether he used a weak moment of the, claimed as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, around themselves one of their erschleichen.
The maximum of three old photographer that is known to his star photos, becomes at the 15th and must account for 16th April 2010 because of weakness in of a crime that is avenged with a prison sentence of at the most three years and a fine of 375.000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this Affaire that is worthy of the saga of one of the richest families of France in which mother and daughter fetzen and to have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal simultaneously in the hand.
In the same way, however, the 15th punishment chamber ordered a medical investigation of the 87 - year old Liliane Bettencourt which is carried out together by three doctors.
The heiress and main stockholder of L'Oréal refused up to now to subject oneself to such an particularly not under that, during the investigations of the prosecution of conditions presented to Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are still supposed to present before the 10th March 2010 a report in which you announce clearly whether and at which times Liliane Bettencourt can have been in a state of.
I think she will subject herself to these investigations.
I will speak with it, declared the attorney of Ms Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiations.
What the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, concerned Me Olivier Metzner, it is very satisfied with the decision of the.
This is an excellent piece of news (.) . The expert opinion will prove, he confirmed that it (Banier) manipulated this old lady that one must protect.
Since two years the only has initiated a legal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkuenstler, from Liliane Bettencourt and accuses him, to have exploited the weakness of their mother for years in order to erschleichen donations of in total a billion euros in the form of bank drafts, insurance policies or paintings.
For your part having been manipulated by the photographer who she regards as a long-standing friend had always proved Liliane Bettencourt wrong.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the complaint initiated by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the attorneys led on Friday to a large.
So the attorney appointed himself letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote from Liliane Bettencourt on three ones sent by his client onto their notary that she distrusts the husband of.
According to their attorney Liliane Bettencourt added following: you " could " declare "please to my daughter, that I have written fifteen years long, once or twice daily at Banier.
I" have never again "been able" to speak "Françoise since their marriage.
The prosecution of Nanterre is renewed the opinion that the complainant did not have any right to react so particularly, because a guardianship judge refused their request in the last days, a judicial protection procedure against their mother to introduce.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully having legal capacity, does not stand under protection and does not have any guardian.
Nobody has the right to act at their place", confirmed the representative of the prosecution, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court decided now on giving a judgment after the process for to the admissibility of occurred.
Manager - revolution or the end of the?
If nothing is changed at the leadership the large French's enterprise was our fight for nothing for the development of the economic...
Since over a, the attitude of the administration of great enterprises with respect to his employees, the consumer said to the position of the vis-à-vis before the marketing revolution: It is for the personnel join " Evaluates " determines the best, to cover as it formerly was open the consumer products' of the technicians in the forms.
When you the marketing revolution gave the strategies of the conquest of the markets to the customers into the centre of the in the place. although the authoritarian products separated factors preferences of the cover again regular!
A demobilization of the employees can lead to a deadly.
Only the spitzes of a much greater phenomenon which affects in particular the employees are the suicides with France Telecom, PSA or Renault.
This demobilization affects negatively the development of all intellectual functions of the, in particular onto those ones of F&Eund, what is even more decisive, onto those ones of the economic.
In Fact the IE demands (Intelligence Economique = economical intelligence) "of all the parties (.) a proactive and a forward-looking demands from the employees a use that the instructions of the authoritarian completely contradict.
Therefore we demand a company internal revolution which would consist in putting the employees into denMittelpunkt of the concerns of the equally next to the customers.
Very conditional use opinion polls internally
Will the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire which Orange presented to his wage earners stimulate this revolution with respect to the management - practice?
I fear, unfortunately not.
At first, because I could state that finally the entire structure arrives faced with of a new situation following many in this case major that to tun,...was it always has done.
Also because of the increases - one of the Pathologien the power- proportionally to the importance of his own.
And finally, because most managers have a strongly simplified idea of human.
Followed from the big schools of engineering your interpretation of the is mechanistic.
You take over the old behaviorist theory which recently was reactivated from the US American " neurosciences " and spread comprehensively unknowingly of research institutes and through the media through intellectual comfort.
Thus and when it suggests that it is possible to control the " levers " (sic) for on the involvement of, an aktüllein Le Figaro.fr confirms appeared inquiry of Ipsos the managers in an attitude for a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today ’ s.
The mobilization factors identify and measure
Instead of this a company internal revolution, necessary for the proper functioning of the modern, presupposes the assumption of a final view of human.
It consists in integrating a fundamental into every consideration or practice of the control: for the wage earners the engagement is only then possible for the enterprise if it appears unequivocal as a means in order to realize a part of their dreams, their ambition and their intentions.
Currently the studies only take over this conception of the motivation of the from the multifunctional.
These studies showed that they judge their enterprise on the basis of a set Doxa which allows them through their perceived picture of the to estimate what offers it to them for the realization of their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this the managers of can control their "social achievement", to predict and to anticipate and to seat their Human resource again management at the right.
So they create a fertile ground which is favorable to the synchronized development of a robust and efficient economic.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" is Obama Lob worth from the right

The conservatives that had mocked the allotment of the price at Obama on 9th October applauded of the speech by the this time, the example of the former vicepremiership candidate at the elections in 2008 following.
I liked what he said, declared Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican party in the daily paper of USA Today and added that she herself brought up the topic of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensöben published memoirs.
The war is as a matter of course the last thing which I think that the Americans want to do it of, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists there below, she says.
Obama that inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in and in Afghanistan, made an effort on Thursday in for justifying the use of; a kind and manner, to declare his Entscheidungvon nine days ago to send 30.000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion the Präsdent achieved "very good work" in Oslo.
I thought that the speech was really very good, of the former president of the House of rejoiced, that especially the reference to "the existence of evil in the " in the words Obamas recognized.
Felt in some parts habeich this speech absolutely as historical, Ginrich declared that was consulted in the radio transmission "The Takeaway".
The previous representative that is regarded as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012 by some said it is delighted to have seen a "president of the left wingers" that reminded the members of the of that they "are "not free and could hand over a price to pay for not, if the use of power did not exist".
Obama held "a very American speech" for Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and in the meantime editor near the Washington mail.
Besides, that it than " cosmopolite " represents that" the Europeans "as in a security bubble live that did not create it themselves and for whose protection they" do not " do " much how it always makes it, it spoke as an American when it referred to that so Gerson.
Among the few ones, the former UNO ambassador John Bolton described to not convinced rights, a falcon of the era Bush, the speech on the website of the review Online as "boring, bombastic and inspiration - free ".
To the left one of the democratic shows himself worried about that, defended as Barack Obama the going back onto the armed forces.
One packs the war under the guise of, the massacre can very simply be justified at the innocents, it warns.
The press of the moderates keeps on remaining, however, praisingly at the side of the.
The Los Angeles Times that still thinks that the Nobel prize was assigned to Obama anticipated described the address even for a speaker as it that is known to his talent, as "Monumental work".
The speech in Oslo the Californian daily paper "offers a flowchart to the control of the international decisions against the conflicts, the poverty and the suppression," enthusiastically so.
The New York Times is of the, that Obama "the necessary announced" and "his speech refers to it as dark and exemplary at the same time".

"We oppose the closure of the on principle.
That does not solve the problems, according to energy minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening which was supported by the government", according to the political market observer Ahmet Insel.

New Silicon-Valley
Long years it was valid as a secret city, inaccessible for western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the Moscow capital, was in the Soviet Union a severely guarded location for secret armament research.
Today the commune with their 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers of the Moscow center away, is regarded as "Russian silicon Valley".
Significant research and production places for Micro- and to nanoelectronics suit here.
Already since September 2008 representatives Selenograds had linked contacts to the Frankfurter science location reed mountain - with the uni-institutes and the companies of the Frankfurter innovation center (FIZ).
There were a number of mutual and on now signed Selenograd and reed mountain in Frankfurt some "protocols for on closer ".
The Moscow vice-mayor Juri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian, for Frankfurt planning departmental head Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010 representatives of the and small and middle enterprises of the scientific Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar for will travel.
Scientific exchange
It is a question of a continuous scientific.
But it is a question also of economical relationships.
It is made for of the possible to grab feet on the growing Russian.
Reversed Russian science companies tasks want to get in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of significant Russian research institute and enterprise.
To that appertain for instance the Moscow Institute for, the large company groups Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The commune had been set up in 1958 as " a " so-called " socialist " plan city" for the armament research.
Selenograd (literally "green city" translates) received his name of the wooded hill landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake block
Of the stuttgart 21 is not let at all highly to apply enough.
For those in favour of the it is a question in a simple way and simply of "the new heart of Europe".
Rake so. much more is S21 as the Depression bag a railway station's, more than one monstrous project that will fling the town of the Baden-Wurtemberg capital into utter construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails that end right in of the were regarded then as call processing Fossilien of the 19th century that worked as brake blocks of a modern since it needed a lot of time once enormously to convert according to from behind in front.
Come in, shortly hold, keep on going - to go so soll´s.
And therefore the terminals should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passage railway station that for instance lies on half stretch of the trans-European rail Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is started now in fact although the visions of the eighties are not compatible with the reality anymore for a long time.
Even very much ambitious planners recognized that it is almost exorbitantly expensive in the Hessian one and the Bavarian city that bag Depression move.
Terminals do not have, however, also any one and exit problem anymore since there are modern push-pull trains with urge vehicles and control trailers at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 with the ICE new building stretch to Ulm is asked now.
Country and local politicians put it through.
The railways join in, also because the risks of the greatest infrastructure Einzelprojekts of the Republic of the carries and not the state company group.
City - Structurally the intention makes still quite justify.
It new city room arises that - one believes the computer - generated graphics of the planners - green is endowed with a lot.
For the transportation system rail S21 is harmful.
The through station and the stretch expansion are thought for the passenger traffic, that one ascribed - typical 80th years - gigantic growth.
Then there was not the competition of the yet.
It must be, however, a question first of starching regard to the since the transportation is considerably more environment-friendly on the rail than by on the for modern transportation policy.
Nevertheless the new building stretch is not worth because of vehement gradients for freight trains.
It is still much more serious that S21 affects also many other rail projects indirectly.
Good six billion euros are supposed to become in the Schwäbischen verbuddelt.
That is the official.
Experts hold ten for realistic to 15 billion.
Celebration stands, in the next the money will be missing at other junctions and in the.
In total sixty greater projects stand on the list of the.
One of the most important is the expansion well that one 180 kilometers long stretch through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the route is built in the slow motion speed.
Urgently necessary to press onto the tube here correctly would be.
However S21 works as a brake block.
The Rhine valley stretch becomes the bottle-neck for the international freight traffic: right in the.
Government examines on the
The central government left open in the Wiesbadener landtag whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian administrative court yard (VGH) for to banning.
The CDU / FDP - coalition charged experts to make around the VGH - judgment containing more than 400 be examined juridically, said minister for economic affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had established at the these days' written, that the country must control the night flight prohibition again in the case of the construction of the planned north-west landing strip in the Frankfurter airport.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5, how it plans the central government, is not to be arranged with the by law offered protection of the population against noise at night.
The coalition must decide until 4th January whether it goes into revision against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and closed in on the representatives of the, to renounce a revision with the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
CDU and FDP asked SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel to return to a night flight prohibition again for their promises done before the choice. Otherwise this is to be evaluated as "a breach of promise".
It is condemnedly heavy, if one may hold his word, greens - leader Tarek Al-Wazir said in allusion to the FDP choice slogan "We hold word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of, the central government attempts nevertheless still to come to their night flights with "Rechtsverdreherei and Trickserei".
Precise legal needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a right - secure Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The way it represents the opposition the statements of its group never to banning have never been.

It then nevertheless everything worked more quickly than thoughtly.
Hardly two weeks after the ZDF administration council had pushed the editor-in-chief of the from the office, the sender can present a successor.
Yesterday evening the committee wanted to vote on the Personalie.
Peter Frey, conductor of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was regarded as a favorite.
There was not a confirmation from the sender for that, however - official, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However also played a might have played, the ZDF commissary not to keep on damaging Markus Schächter, also this proposal should not come through with the administration council.
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14.
The result of the was not yet certain with copy deadline of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter had failed with his proposal to extend the contract with Santa Claus Brender around further five years in on the.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against it. Brenders Abwahl was a bitter defeat for Schächter, an one erwartbare, however.
Because the union majority in the administration council not to want to confirm Brender in the office had signaled already weeks before the choice.
The Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized The organised resistance against the.
With the argument under Brender the news of the would have lost audience ratings he refused a further term of office of the chief editor highly looked at.
To shortly before the choice there were therefore protests in which the political influence it was castigated.
Last even 35 Staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate, that the procedure of Kochs than unconstitutionally assessed.
It did not use anything.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on the 4th in 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
After that it worked with the southwest radio and the Frankfurter panorama.
In 1983 Frey to the ZDF changed, at first to the " heute-journal ".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal spoke of the; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; to 1998 conductors and presenter of the "morning magazine"; to 2001 conductors of the; since then conductor of the.
The greens announced after the Abwahl a constitution complaint to Brenders who was still elected as of the year was elected on from the branch leaf medium magazine.
Kochs opponent in the, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared in the last, the countries should change the ZDF state contract so that personnel proposals of the commissary can not be blocked through a politically motivated.
Also Beck excluded a departure of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of, however.
Brenders probable successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Management Board with a bold - when it criticized the committee hard immediately after the Brender Abwahl for that.
Thanks to this proof's journalistischer independence could it both to nominate Schächter without face loss for the post of the chief editor as also the administration council choose without coming into the suspicion to heave a Parteigänger into the office.
In the party arithmetic Frey is assigned anyhow to the link liberals.
Study is cleared
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike the culture ministers of the gave in on Thursday at last: At a meeting of cult minister and college rector conference both pages agreed on wanting to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and master.
The students should be future in the situation to also be able to overcome their study.
In detail they agreed upon reducing the examination loads: Fundamentally every study module is only still supposed to close with a single.
Furthermore should the work load of the studying ones checks and to be guaranteed "a realistic and justifiable measure".
Politics and colleges want to simplify furthermore the recognition of between the colleges within and outside of Germany.
The countries committed themselves to arranging common structure handicaps more flexibly for Bachelor- and master courses of studies.
There are in addition not supposed to be country regulations differing from that.
Few examinations'
Since beginning of the student protests in cult ministers and uni-rectors wear the winged word from the ' better in the.
Now it was filled for the first time with a specific.
The so-called accreditation council decided on reducing the number of the examinations in part drastically: " every module closes normally off" only with only a ", it is said in a 30 - page - paper which is supposed to control the admission of courses of studies in part again.
With the "clear decrease of the examination load", the Akkreditierungsrat-Vorsitzende Reinhold Grimm declared, is supposed to be offered an "inappropriate development stop, that influenced the Studierbarkeit considerably."
Furthermore the " Studierbarkeit " is supposed to be future "the decisive criterion" during the organization.
Modules as contents are to be checked severe then, whether "unnecessary constrictions of the studying ones during the choice the
Events" would be avoided.
The students "would have kept elbow room that facilitate and support initiative" Claim".
The rules are supposed To be valid with the admission of courses of studies new, but existing also during the inspection.
These must "be re-accredited" every five years - what, however, means that it lasts to 2015 until all courses of studies were checked.
Ten accreditation agencies which subordinate to the accreditation council established by the countries are responsible for that in a nationwide way.
The cult ministers had asked the countries in "with emphasis" to influence so the agencies that the material abundance not too large and is the examination regime not too strict.
In single federal states universities and technical colleges with the country ministries agreed already upon corresponding measures.
As has been said in one single Rhineland-Palatinate confirmed in this case additional means for the further development of the.
From the money the colleges are supposed to establish above all and fortify study consultation as well as examination and foreign offices.
Country and colleges want to spend ten million euros for that.
At the beginning of 2010 the government wants to insert a novelette of the college law in the parliament.
After this just a single is supposed to be necessary for the conclusion of a.
The study organization is supposed to become more flexible, furthermore the recognition is supposed to be facilitated guaranteed by achievement proofs at other colleges and the access to the.
Until end of coming year courses of studies of the are supposed to be checked for their Studierbarkeit everything.
Government and opposition had argued on renewed about the study conditions in the.
Next to praise there was, however, also criticism at the decisions.
The federal executive board of the young socialist Hochschulgruppen demanded the organization of the educational policy is not supposed to occur in the future anymore "behind shut doors" of the ministers and college rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes also the studying ones should speak now a word as concerned persons.
The future academics of the president of the college rector conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, received support: "We need the experiences of the ", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the cult ministers with whom the HRK discussed about a common.
The trade union's education and science (GEW) went the Bonner decisions in total not far enough: It demands a legal claim which makes the access to a continuing master course of studies for every graduate with a Bachelor - end possible.
On the other hand the countries must guarantee that for the present generation of the Bachelor - studying ones master study places with best possible study conditions are available sufficiently tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries must employ more university lecturers clearly.
The cult ministers did not comment on a freer access to the master, however.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Shrinkage in Germany and from is nice almost no. " the first line of a poem of the poet Werner Söllner says, in which this in verstörenden language shreds the arrival experience of a dissident thematisiert, that gained the freedom, but lost his language room at the same time.
The Werner Söllner born in 1951 in the Romanian had worked at first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later than reader in a children's book publishing house, before it 1982 to Frankfurt on the Main moved.
Söllner was marked with various literary prizes, in 1993 it kept the legendary Frankfurter poetics lectures to the Goethe - university, and since 2002 he is a conductor of the in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
It guaranteed for considerable ausserliterarisches sensation on the last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich in the case of which it was a question of "Germans for literature in Romania in the and dragging - mirror of their Securitateakten".
Visibly verunsichert and in embarrassment Söllner read out a declaration, in which it before Romania - German writer colleagues, among other things Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his collaboration when in THE for the Romanian secret service Securitate admitted.
Together with some of the person presents Söllner 1989 had received the German Language Price.
The recruitment attempts would have begun creeping, first 1971.
I am, Söllner closed, "somebody who did not defend himself to the Securitate against attempts at intimidation enough therefore."
The poet Werner Söllner is IN THE Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel prize honor for Herta Müller, which is based on supervision and Bespitzelung, and their unprecedented literary quarrel with the mechanisms of dictatorial the literature scene and in particular the Community of the German authors coming from Romania is shaken by a case that makes recognizable the abysses and the cowardice of a political.
Werner Söllner is, so far one to previous know-how can say, not just, but also victims.
In his Securitate file a role played IN THE Walter, said the literature scientist Michael Markel after the confession Söllners and referred onto the influence positive for it of the IN THE Walter.
He " hewed " it " out " in all points then difficult for it, according to Markel.
It a moral need to do this comment is to him.
Söllners declaration was unexpected in the form and before this public, the confession of a former and its cooperation with the Romanian is not completely surprising, however.
Germany was a cosy preserved for, had written Herta Müller already in the time, after they had read their own acts, 914.
The concerned persons, so one may presume, speculate and to have known also presumably in some case which clear name hid Sorin, Voicu and now also Walter behind the aliases.
Different than at that one in these parts meanwhile very procedure - secure selection the Stasi files' the contact with the legacy of the is still very much diffuse.
A systematic clarification was foiled in the last few and hindered.
A National council corresponding to of the for the reappraisal of the Securitate - files (CNSAS) was based only in 1999, the publication of the proceeded since then, however, rather slowly.
Before since 2005 there is not a law which controls the administration of the.
That the influence of former Securitate - members in Romania is still very much great occupied according to the announcement of the Nobel Prize for an interview in which a former Securitate - leader commented on the prizewinner disparagingly from Temesvar.
It has a psychosis, finally one interrogated it only once.
The infamy of the power meant to be able to be expressed here in a very unconcealed way in the form of the.
Certainly link themselves at the case Söllner, as so often in connection with hidden fault, inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The prudent reaction of the listening ones to Söllners confession lets to hope for the continuation of this chapter being rather determined from knowledge urge than of fault assignment and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel prize, it is more than a.
Saturation supplement champion League
It worked as if just a neatly dressed Aussendienstler would come there of a very nice Christmas celebration over which a sport article manufacturer Goodies had distributed when the new VfB coach Christian Gross climbed in company of an orange plastic bag of the Ausrüsters a quarter hour after midnight into a called C class.
The man with the striking let because of the it still foreign city drive.
Otherwise he could also have gone himself - finally alcohol was not in the game, and the 55 - year long one was gotten drunk for luck just as little.
A pleasant evening had been, however morning continues the work now.
Or first correctly rid.
In the words of the only three before obliged Swiss: "We achieved indeed the dividing into eight parts final", indeed in the champions League thanks to the 3:1-Erfolgs against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "however we must not make ourselves from the success be blinded: a brutal hard becomes against the descent."
The "much more important task" approaches on.
Then it is to repeat the royal class achievement in Mainz in the necessary.
And the absolutely once again revealed weaknesses to the rapid three Gates by (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th) to put down.
Drawing
The dividing into eight parts final of the champions League (First legs 16./17. + February/ Rückspiele 9./10. March) is drawn lots on the 18th December in Nyon.
The joy about the brilliant installation of the kept on therefore being restrained.
Not only at the supposed Heilsbringer who had provided self-confidence, operability and game joy to the verunsicherten Stuttgart pros in the short time.
I went towards the players and it said to them that they are supposed to remember their strengths, and it stopped it to be more courageous, declared the so simply ringing success prescription soul plumber Gross, that under therapist Babbel however no effect had produced more.
It provoked a kind, admitted Babbel - proponent Jens Lehmann, "if in the soccer a new comes, things which one would not have held for possible happen sometimes."
And Sami Khedira, that after like injury pause lasting for weeks thanks to his dynamics to the best players on the advanced, the found " phenomenon " attempted with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the functioning of the new to describe: "He is a man who reachs through and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the current. "
Under Babbel it had lacked that obviously.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, sport executive board warns thicket Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs, however, above all.
How Gross guarded then also players and managers before that, to value the victory against a substitute - weakened and completely overtaxed defense of the Romanian ueber.
You would have won also in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 the bad awakening has come, it gave to consider Khedira.
And sport executive board thicket Heldt admonished, that indeed a season objective reached, the one other, however, still in wide distance is.
We are not above the mountain yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday even according to the first three months since celebrate not after was expected, was due to the events of this that revived in the form of a TV interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann broadcast immediately before game beginning freshly.
There are decisions, the other one strike and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism Lehmanns.
That one had shown to the executive board leadership weakness reproachedly and has decided to the coach change on pressure of pubertierender fans.
Also that free day after that he was deleted to games, Lehmann evaluated as signs of lack of and malevolence.
Lehmanns statements are " shaped " from pure egoism, Heldt split back and announced consequences for the final man.
You do not become friends for the life more, the two forty year long ones.
After all, however, they were agreed in that with all others, that without the preliminary works through the dissolved coach team the playfully and combatively strong idea would have been not possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a great part of the success", said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the agreed.

Heated duel in Bern: Again and again Herausforderer provoked Kevin Johnson Weltmeister Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, according to twelve hard the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight - title according to of the.
The judgment of the turned out unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in the.
The 38 - year old champion according to version of the conquered the US American Kevin Johnson unanimously in the night to of Saturday in to points (120:108, 119: 109) .
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense according to his comeback in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian was already twice a world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately it has with the K.o., that all expected, not put.
Klitschko built up his balance onto 39 victories in 41 pro - fights, twice it had to give itself beatenly due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first in 24.
Before Some 17, 000 spectators in the 2,02 meters big Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight particularly with his left.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson that had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel escaped, however, again and again from the strokes of the, so that Klitschko could bring his dangerous rights not deciding into in the.
In total the passive did too little for a challenger and attempted only over the rounds come.
Indeed it provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his strokes affected the world champion only rarely, however.
After all he is only the second to Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who went over the full with Klitschko from twelve rounds.
The challenger had guaranteed for some whirl before The challenger, before the fight in.
It offended Klitschko as "an ugly zombie", that "nothing correct" can.
During the weighing the champion could be provoked then on Friday to schubsen Johnson from the nose the sunglasses "in order to be able to see his eyes."

I got only a in this fight and am physical very much well in shape, Klitschko had justified the fast return into the ring.
His dream remains, however, the union of all four important in the family.

Supposedly his graduation society plans now already the fight against Klitschko in Londoner Wembleystadion.
Fall to Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greens faction leader Jürgen Trittin called defense minister Guttenberg liar because of wrong information on the.
SPD and Linke demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the recent findings for on the bombing of the opposition assumed defense minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate.
The minister "knowingly said "the untruth" with regard to the murderous onto two tank trucks of, said greens faction leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD - newscast "day show".
One calls that common: He lay.
The command for the killing was given to of the without regard to the rules for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report which the NATO had which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday it had become known that it was not a question only of a destruction of the vices carried off during the attack but also around killing two Taliban leaders purposefully.
At that of the German Kunduz commander colonel Klein requested US air raid were loud killed Nato research report up to 142 people or hurt.
Green Party member, SPD and Linke asked on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to be expressed immediately before the Bundestag and to clear also what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clear whether a strategy of targeted is component of the Afghanistan politics of the Federal Government - and, whether chancellor office, German Federal Armed Forces and news agency approved of this new, Jürgen Trittin and greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
The criticism expelled government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decisively back.
The chancellor office did not take influence onto concrete actions of the German Federal Armed Forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday also doubts about the representation of the ministry about the background to the had become loud from Chief of Staff Wolfgang Schneiderhan and undersecretary Peter Wichert.
According to from the two informed correctly and completely of the backgrounds of the tank vice assault.
Officially it had been said they would have denied the existence of the and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
From the context of the two a bilateral document of the command - having colonel announced, however, that they would have pointed out even several reports to the Ministry of Defense under that and a courier report.
Meanwhile Wichert is supposed to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, the Frankfurter one tells "more generally" Sunday newspaper".
He did not receive an answer up to now, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on On Saturday on the reproaches and referred to this being clarified in the investigation committee of the which wants to constitute on next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures in awake state and hear voices which others do not see or hear.
Not only at psychological sick people and in the drug drunkenness the borders between imagination and reality become blurred.
As long as it happens in the, everything is in order.
If we lie in our eyes in dark with closed eyes, we may devote ourselves unrestrainedly to the wildest ideas and fantasy things.
Who, however, experiences dream - like states in the guard existence, sees things and hears, does not see the other one or hears is regarded as mad or drug - addicted in the modern Western mostly, at least as an eccentric.
Nevertheless such pictures and voices do only not arise at psychological sick people or in the.
Our imagination has fault: The same neural processes which make to project houses, to paint pictures or to write novels for us possible guarantee sometimes for the borders between dream, delusion and reality becoming blurred.
Dream - Like changed guard consciousness states can occur in the most different forms, most at best we mention it visions, in the worst case delusion.
Even if trigger and effect like to distinguish, the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen that nevertheless would drive back drug experiences of the New-Age-Propheten Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations onto similar processes are let.
Hallucinations or delusions arise, when the balance of the neural messenger materials of the - first and foremost doping - amine, noradrenaline, Serotonin and Acetylcholin - derailed and the interaction of different faulty is.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts occur very frequently during a schizophrenic.
The force of gravity does not have any power anymore over it
Philosopher and physician since the antiquity were preoccupied with the connection of delusion and dream.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern, stated in 1861 a "great similarity of the raving with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusion educations, delusions of one like that".
It is fall in 2001 when Henning T. changes into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quietschbunt.
The force of gravity does not have any power anymore over it, it floats at the ceiling.
He senses a step.
Behind it winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted rascals, tooth - showing.
You hunt it, kick it with heavy, blazing boots, fling it against the walls, he senses the pains at in the whole.
Loud, malicious voices drone from walls and radio.
He can not stand it anymore, the voices that swear and offend it.
Henning T. tears two cables from the stereo set, she ties to a loop and she attaches at a hook to the cover.
It climbs a loudspeaker and lays himself the loop around the neck.
Jump.
The loop solves.
That is supposed to be you a lesson, the voices shout in eardrum - shredding choir, "go into the clinic and make yourself be cured"!
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute, the last one is 2 years behind, that first almost 20.
It was activated by LSD.
His diagnosis says schizoaffektive - paranoid psychosis, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes medicines, against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, since three years it is married.
In the psychosis I experienced worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are cruel reality
One percent of the falls ill at least once in the life at schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is handled as a most second - frequent illness after the depression.
In a time of acute schizophrenic more can not differentiate between inside and exterior world mostly concerned persons, guessed it into an aroused state, that to hallucinations, size, relationship or pursuit delusion can lead.
The voice hearing is especially spread - voices that order, comment or dialog.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The concerned person is Important no more of Unimportant to separate, the brain can not filter out disturbing signals more, the consciousness is flooded from impressions.
As the dream also the psychosis opens the sluices for a flood of and fantasies which originate from deeper consciousness shifts.
The reality perception in the psychosis is subject - centered, says professor Thomas Fuchs, assistant medical director of the clinic for General psychiatry in the Heidelberg university clinic.
The schizophrenic is in at the heart of, everything has an importance focused on it.
Simultaneously it gets into a passive role, he becomes, similar as in the, from the events overwhelms and she can not shape actively.
Schizophrenics often feel therefore threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality adjustment is not mostly possible to them, the hallucinations are cruel reality, wakes impossible.
To have experienced a hallucination once in the life
Differently than in the, Fuchs says, "the sensuous and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis keeps on, however, receiving fundamentally."
The wahnhaften thoughts and hallucinations rest in the reality, the alienation of the experience occurs in real.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, Forscher puts still for puzzles.
Exception states can result with every human being in his losing the reality cover on a short-term basis, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to give a genetic predisposition to, but twin studies showed that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimum brain damages with concerned persons.
We presume that the neural maturation of the brain is interrupted in an early stage of through a virus illness of the mother during pregnancy for example, explains Fuchs.
But a puzzle remains as the trouble of the neural system is achieved which does not manifest itself at all furthermore first of all over many years.
Also environmental impacts play a role - triggers can be stress or traumatic experiences for a psychosis if the disposition is available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can activate psychoses since they intervene in the transmitter system.
If our brain run hot
The mad thing is, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and they swallow expensive medicines in order to rid themselves of it others spend money for drugs in order to get which one, says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether hallucinations are felt as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of the.
Kasten gathers since ten years reports about hallucinations and deceit appearances, in the last year it evaluated his results in the book "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations belong indeed for the typical of psychoses, but also of astonishing many other.
For this purpose such as, epilepsy, Multiple Sclerosis or Alzheimer and skull brain traumas often belong next to psychological troubles as Borderline or depression.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions themselves the brain healthy.
Hallucinations consist, according to Kasten, of memory contents which usually are held back.
They arise if brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or hampered to little; if our brain run hot or also, if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can activate this state just the same as brain damages or a psychosis.
But now also charm revocation, stress, lover's grief or other mental.
In more recent gave up to one third of the to have experienced a hallucination at least once in the life.
In the summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and she attends the grammar school there.
Perfectly normal, actually.
If were the pictures and voices not there.
In the pause it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hairs speaks to him.
If it answers to him, the schoolmates look at it surprisedly - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
You hold the shy girl for a versponnene day dreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, she knows that.
It is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just the same as they the girl hears in the bank next to themselves and sees.
She can even sense his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I am mad?, she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows, that this boy and the other are not real is and again disappear.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening
Often the hallucinations are also a load.
If she is in the, it can not follow the instruction material sometimes because the teacher introduces just a new in their eyes and ears while it is explaining mathematical equations for all others hör- und sichtbar at the board.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening.
If she waits in its dark for the sleep to which a lot too rarely and much comes too late, it can not distinguish her often whether it is awake or already dreams whether the pictures that she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding lacerations at arms and legs, in front of their open or closed eyes arise.
Leave me in peace, she yells at the figures.
She does not tell anything of that to parents and friends, those ones would hold it for mad.
. The autumn of 2009. is today 20 years old.
She withstood in the past the school-leaving examination and lives together with their friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she incorporated in the internet contact to the psychologist Kasten, she knows exactly, that they is not mad.
Delusion is also a work of art from despair
If somebody is socially isolated or suffers from charm revocation, he has hallucinations with probability, after a, says Kasten.
I presume the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and guarantees even for his conversation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid as a small girl of other children, it played frequent only.
Your hallucinations began when she found out with 13 that the man who she mentions daddy since she can think is not their bodily father.
Since in the case of audio visual and the same brain fields which process also real impressions and noises are active, it is difficult for concerned persons as Sarah K. to distinguish hallucinations and reality. "Every experiencing" occurs ", says castes, "in the, the reality is shown there.
Hallucinations are also pictures that the brain makes arise, therefore they seem so real."
Kasten evaluates also nocturnal visions as a form of.
The hallucinations of recovering are not distinguished basically from those of an acute.
Unlike schizophrenics psychologically Healthy ones are in the situation to recognize their hallucinations as unreal.
Kasten guesses his patient therefore, the hallucinations also as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Boundary condition between dream and hallucination
In our too very much consciousness - centered world imaginary experience becomes unfortunately mostly pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor, in Heidelberg and medical superintendent of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale - hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is A climate is a terrible, tragic, but it brings out also Positive, Creative - delusion is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard investigated the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of the dream - like changed guard consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly - complex, detailed quasi - dreams that the experiencing one holds for real and that it can not distinguish from the guard state also afterwards.
The oneiroide consciousness state arises in trauma or illness - conditional extreme situations, for example with Polyradikulitis - patients who experience a motor paralysis with full consciousness.
If a human being is threatened from self and world loss, about through, for example by continuing, total, it replaces the life - alarming real situation by an own, imaginary world that is uncoupled from the reality Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A kind of boundary condition between dream and hallucination.
Since the completion of a is not possible in the reality, a world change occurs, the real situation is vergegenwärtigt, however, in the imagination.
An intense form of the sense foundation and interpretation in a situation intolerable at themselves that its own makes not to sink in a nothing of the for us people possible.
Everything is real, also later in the memory
Also the Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid - experiences in his book "heart change" as a rescue operation of the.
It is 49 years old when his consciousness happens after a cardiac valve operation with followed by a for days on journeys while his body is being condemned on the intensive care unit for the motionlessness.
Claussen dives into a self created world, goes to foreign times and places: He sees himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
It lives in the early among noble ones which manufacture drugs of blood.
Is verschleppt by a Greek on the motorcycle into his native country, surfs with his hospital bed in the firn of the alps and strikes a Korean.
He is completely fascinated by the imaginierten event, everything is real, also later in the memory.
These internal journeys distinguish for Claussen basically from every dream.
Dream is a different, he describes his experience.
Very in contrast the memories are still überdeutlich to me from mental journeys after years and in secondary details.
More clearly and more intensely Seen even as real.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other life - mundane experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drug drunkenness show how fragile our internal copies of the external are also in the awake one.
The psychologist Kasten resümiert, every change of in the, " can " lead "to a deformation of what we mention reality."
An experience, that can be absolutely also enriching.
The snow burglary can come
Burda
Children are supposed to take over the publishing house with 27
The new publishing house leader Kallen is an intermediate solution: On a long-term basis Hubert Burda wants to give his enterprise into the hands of his two, he said the MIRROR.
The holding company is supposed to appertain also in future to 100 % of the.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his enterprise long-term in the hands of.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the fixed will, the 69 - year long one said to enter the enterprise, the MIRROR.
We controlled the details for this purpose as a precaution.
The question whether they are active also in the surrenders only after that.
Also the question whether they are for this purpose in the situation.
One can not give 7500 employees his children if they are not sufficiently enabled.

The promises of FonPeek
Peek is äuerst limited, a device with which one can read only his E-Mails, without a possibility to be able to see certain appendixes or to be able to surf through the Internet.
His five minutes of fame, when the magazine Time chose it for one of the products of the year, enjoyed it.
To see it on the Strae is rather improbable, but the idea at themselves is in spite of that before everything for young people of.
Unlike the Smartphones Peek costs only very little and a very favorable Flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of, has.
After the enterprise saw that has seen the, launched two new: one that is thought only for Twitter, the other one with a lifelong free service for data, completely unlike the Peek at which one must pay a six times higher price.
The European version of the and thus its third is Fonpeek which yesterday was introduced during the event Le Web.
It has the same borders, as its American, however, were a has ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros in the month, for the whole contains Europe.
Those ones that travel with a Smartphone around the world know already what means to have to renounce all the in order to be able to read his e-mails as soon as one ran over the border or if one despairs to a café with searches (or a connection possibility with Fon).
The idea of the roaming with is incredibly seductive and should be actually already for a long time possible.
It is right already that some telephone providers offer already specific contracts and prices for stays abroad, but according to in my one needs already a doctorate into physics and a good in order to be able to read all the small print.
Remained the repeated criticism on the part of the European commission with respect to affordable Roamingtarife for whole Europe in an almost always unseen way.
One always read Auerhalb of's own fear his e-mails and that with right.
That a small device as FonPeek (at which nevertheless it is again and again amazing that it has the name Fon in spite of its not having any Wifi/WLAN) can offer, meant, that the telephone providers slowly, but surely think and they must start taking different possibilities into account.
Kindle is another good for that, in his prices the Downloaden is contained by books and further questions downloaded from the.
Without Vetrag and without hooks.
In this case it is a question of an internet - capable device and one pays for that only one single, indeed during the purchase, and not month for month.
And exactly that it is, what I expect of FonPeek also one day, a purchase possibility with lifelong internet access as the Peek already in the USA offers it.
And that not, because I would like to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the, thanks.
But I expect this because I think that it would be an appropriate model for the.
Nevertheless it would be interesting to be able to see a computer to see with the same once.
The fetish color of Michelle
The favorite color is yellow without doubts to the American.
Already with the assumption of office of Barack Obama as a president of the it appeared in a dress and a mantle of the and the same color chose again to help most second - important moment with his, without doubts, around it in his life: to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in.
Michelle Obama bore very similar with both reasons: auer, that it was almost the same - a shining greenish yellow - the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same one Material-, and it carried something for this purpose groförmig embroidered or a necklace.
It is possible even so far that it had the appearance with at first, that the first lady in the wanted to follow the model of the from Asturien and she had decided on wearing the same with more than one.
Nevertheless, however the two distinguish in the material kind from which they are produced very much.
During the inauguration it wore a dress from top and in Oslo of one of patterned velvet.
Also the Accessoires were different: with the first green shoes with semihigh sales and with the second indeed a änhliches model, however golden.
Also the hairdo was each time different: The hairs had put up with this occasion, as, at the previous one she wore the hairs openly.
75 % of the working mothers got problems because of their motherhood in the work
The discrimination in the work increased in the last years, particularly with the younger women who would like to have children.
For this result the study "Fertility and career of the women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for comes.
The inquiry among 9.737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 does not let any doubt at that: 75 % of the working women see their career chances restricted on the labour market on the grounds of their.
The study discloses, that it groe differences with the decision, to found a family and to the number of gives, depending on whether, whether the women work or not and when yes, which kind from profession they carry out.
Those ones of them, that auerhalb of the no other perform, only part-time work or any fixed articles of employment do not have, mothers rather become and more children have.
In Contrast the women with a permanent postpone, particularly in the public field, the foundation of a and motherhood and also less children have therefore.
"The women in the age-group between 35 and 49 years with a strong get their first child on only 3,7 years according to the contraction, a number that increases itself to 4,1 years for with permanent that longer needed to achieve this and that to have realized their contraction and their first much later.
Auerdem has also has the kind of a groen influence on the motherhood, although less declares than the calendar with regard to the conception willingness, the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The education level is a further factor which must be considered at in the age of the with the marriage and the first.
According to inquiry the age is the higher with at the time of and the first, per more highly the education level.
This difference could be found also with the women of the same.
For example the women in the group between 35 and 49 became, depending on whether, whether they have only the nine-year elementary school end or a higher education on average in each case with 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time mother.
Further there is still, according to their education level, a further difference between the women.
While the women with main end are already before their first getting married and getting their first, the women with a medium-sized or high do it exactly the other way round and search only a and get married after that and get then their first, Delgado finds.
It is itself also worth to Diane Kruger
L'Oréal Paris added recently a new to his on all sides envied list from ambassadresses: Diane Kruger.

Coward aggression
My 70 - year old mother went for a walk last week through our quarter, when ran suddenly a group from young people between 15 and 18 years next to it and our dog in the small town Fünlabrada, our dog is a crossbreed that we got from the animal home and that once just weighs six kilos, and then out of the blue they gave him two kicks and hurt it in this way heavily.
One can not put our indignation into words at all since it is unintelligible to us where the fun is supposed to be there with a cheap Agression against a small and helpless animal which as a matter of course was taken out at the rope.
For this purpose is the comes, that a woman, that went for a walk cosy, got, when she wanted to zurechtweisen these persons due to the incident, she feared even for their own, because if such a attacks a dog maybe, he becomes the same one also with a woman, a an elderly or probably to do even with everyone that is weaker than he himself.
The incident happened in a normally calm neighbourhoods at five in the afternoon on an ordinary.
The dog long howled the whole day.
Of course we refunded advertisement in a near sited police station, nevertheless we have, however, great doubts whether actually that will bring something and we only still explain in order to prevent any prejudice, from the outset, would like that the cowardly were Spaniards.
Our indignation about the happened thing led us to announcing this incident.
We can not understand what must go on in the minds of those young that they find a cheap attack on it would penalise a defenceless merry, onto an animal that gives us to love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good and the respect towards the animals and the persons remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the
The tire manufacturer Michelin started up in collaboration a campaign for the promotion of the helmet use with the Spanish foundation for road safety (Fesvial) particularly with the young as today both enterprises announced.
This initiative wants to make in this way attentive onto the importance of the since finally it is at that of the single protection element that can prevent head injuries and/or even the death in the event of a question.
Michelin that "grasps more far than only the projecting and production of products referred to this campaign representing part of their obligation with respect to the road safety that become increasingly more secure with every day" and kept on confirming that they help also with other actions educational and informative to come to this objective a step nearer every day.
This new campaign for the promotion of the helmet use on the motorcycle which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will distribute in a first posters at more than 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve so the most best - possible circulation.
To the end Michelin stressed that the road safety "a constant worry" of the enterprise is and just for the reason, since they always see themselves as manufacturers obligedly to that from tires for zwei-rädige vehicles, that one of their main aims the development of ever safer must be.
The sale of pick-up trucks goes up again a little
After almost two the selfmarket begins for trucks to see some light at the end of the dark at last.
The 9.425 vehicles that were approved in Spain intimate an increase of 12.6 to reference to the year 2008, and, what is still much more important, they are in this way the first anyway after 22 consecutive months, keep going with, gemae the numbers presented by the and the car dealer association Ganvam.
These good numbers are, however, at this time only with grör caution too genieen, since the reference data of November 2008 used for the comparison are, which was an especially bad Verkausjahr with a drop around 60 % concerning the preceding year.
However, one must consider, that, foreseen from the rise in the last, the total admissions of these 11 months still 40 % below the sales figures of the previous lie.
Since January in total 95.853 vehicles were sold, in this number all vehicles which the truck market consists of are, however, contained: Descendants of private cars, pick-up, trucks, small vans and lighter pick-up truck / chassis.
Furthermore the same are still at in the, which the demand pull the most in Mitleidenschaft, because even if some of the are bought by private persons, the Groteil of the sales goes onto small and middle enterprises that make the purchase by a in almost 100 % of all.
So must one for these restrictions that are the consequence of the closed money cock of the credit institutions even further factors with einschlieen, as the increase in the or the persistence of the poor.
With this panorama and unlike the private cars, the financial helped little during the purchase of a vehicle of the.
This plan is not, however, certain only for private persons, also self-employed persons and small enterprises have a right on that, when they a truck up to 3.5 tonnes with a, that not 160 grams per driven kilometer would like to buy may exceed, to speak the low, however, for himself.
Just yesterday again Ganvam had reminded of its being absolutely necessary on the part of the also introducing a specific focus on this as well as to judge of course also onto the industry vehicles (Trucks and buses).
The car dealer union prophesies the year 2010 for a similar as the just last one for which it reckons a sale loss (at private cars and ground cars) of 19 %.
The support at brake maneuvers in critical situations is now duty
As then already with the ABS antiblocking brake system and as it passes now just with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for on the brakes in must become a duty equipment in the European.
In fact they are already duty at all again approved private cars and light trucks, for the remaining February 2011 was set a qualifying period until end.
The Manahme concluded by the European Union has to the objective to correct the protection to the Fugänger, however, these brake systems can help due to of their also with preventing many rear-end collisions.
The task of the consists in exerting more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver which recognizes the system by means of the brake strength carried out by the onto the brake pedal.
However, this system does not practice this pressure up to until the.
Investigation aloud commissioned to one of the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident in front of the collision was not received at all anymore, to step onto the brake pedal and half of them had not braked with full strength.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The brake help on the other hand meshes with maximum strength with the brake system and reduces through that the braking time and thus also the brake distance which a car covers with in the.
According to a study by the fatal accidents in the case of which Fugänger come to damage could be prevented every year up to 1.100 if all cars were endowed with this kind by emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer - one reckons one in four accidents involving being able to be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is endowed with a system that recognizes (about radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver with which it exerts simultaneously already a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts then, the system helps him with increasing the pressure to the brake pedal if it would become necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the in order to hold the damages in this way in a as small way as possibly.
General engine changes the plan for Opels until January
During the staff of the Opel work in Figürülas (Zaragoza) already through Nick Reilly, the new chairperson of general engine (GM) Europe, were taught, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first, probable at the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer refers to his needing more time in order to finish the rescue plan for Opels.
Nod Reilly, the new chairperson of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the affected page gives their approval for every single point of the plan in advance same.
And for this reason it can be that the final document will postpone that is presented first to first of the and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works until beginning 2010.
On the other hand it is assured on the part of GM that it will make a decision in the next concerning the sale of.
There it is not surprising, that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American one car builder, in this way this as soon as possibly a decision affects.
GM adds, to be in contact with a number of possible new.
One of these buyers could be Geely who would like to buy up Volvo also gladly, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars which has Converg Rückendeckung from the Russian ever stronger, wins.
If it with none should this buyer come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese.
The decision, Saab at the end of the too schlieen if it was not sold until then will maintain also furthermore.
At the steering wheel of the
The engineers used the Boxster S for the development of their latest and very expensive as a basis and nevertheless really managed to make it about 80 kilos with which it brings 1.275 kilos now only still onto the scales easier.
In order to create something like that, they refused when first onto the automatic drop-down roof that was replaced by a canvas roof with manual drive in this way alone one saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used with this model as those of the GT3 " disappear " wider 15; through the deletion of the once again 13; auerdem one has reduced the tank of 64 on 54 liters, in this way further 7 were saved; through the installation of sporting still once 12 and saved to five with the light 19 - customs rims again.
Then one had still also reached through the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 renewed six kilos of less and through the exchange of the door handles through grips of material the lack of.
Although it is available also with the double clutch gear PDK, the test-drive with a vehicle was carried on with 6 - course manual gear, main on the smaller Landstraen of California, on mountain stretches that really went by very windingly.
With his driving behavior one can give him the impeccably.
He did not lie the decrease of its now for this purpose under any circumstances, however, geführtdass no more so secure on the Strae.
It is rather the opposite the case: since we have reached already no more a so small and tested light model that gives one also a feeling of grör security simultaneously, however, with the graphs, even at high.
He is a small, to recover for this purpose ably to brake his muscles in the necessary time with a low walk to make warm until we give him the commands to race and to get at the new one of everything then again out of his engine...
It does all which one says to him. The car does all that we point out to him with our hands at the steering wheel thanks to his guidance that is just as communicative as also precise.
And it does it with the precision of.
A Motorsound for all taste directions
The Sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) succeeded distinctly and one can still increase it with that one 'sport'-Option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noises that was used already at for the first time.
The accelerating capacity is inconceivably brutal, identical, whether out of the stand or near the renewed acceleration.
The resiliences are strong, however not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraen on which we went with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had to do on the whole almost nothing at all; and that, although we thought ice of on the at some of these curves in at the and loose chipping.
In conclusion one can say that it is an ultralight car, a car with which one has an indescribable going - fun, as there is it otherwise presumably rather rarely and in it a slight improvement of the is much more than only.
The car will come in February 2010 to the market and cost 70.831 EUROS.

The Caja Laboral celebrated, in spite of the many unusual players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit on the complicated Fuballfeld of the Maccabi Electra and comes in this way to the first place within his group after the groartigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triple the best was to of his (29 with the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant failure rates of gentleman man, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a groe dose at use and teamwork, even if they wait for their victory up to the bitter end prospecting.
Splendid right from the out contributed with 16 assessed triple mageblich to its final.
The game began with the leadership of the purple violet ones who sat down at the top from the beginning on the advertisement board.
Since the first four baskets of the already came from Vitoria out of the perimeter, one could foresee already that they had come to the ground with wrists well warmed up.
There were English and Teletovic, that for that 18-20 were mainly responsible at the end of the first.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team decided for an inside - sided game of Barac from Álava and for the game of Eliyahu that was received during his return to the team with whistles and applause which to be is a home in order to build up their advantage further up to the pause (34-43).
Teletovic already began, than best his team, with 13 emphasize, already to foresee that one also wennn "minus six" Evaluation of splinter lieen, that this would not be the best evening of.
In spite of that the game was not decisive in spite of the clear in the pause for a long time yet and the Makkabäer wanted to remind the Vitorianer once again of on their ground everyone not winning, and thanks to the "hand of Elías" attacking again and again they came back ins Spiel.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the " yellow " ones turning round the oar (50-49).
Still more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, hurts, but everything else than dead, had to prepare a few opening gambits with, in order to get air again and came at one of them sudden the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who provided that with three almost consecutive triple and with the support of English and Ribas, that on the advertisement board distance calming again was indicated of (54-67), that of the host at the end of the third could embellish with (57-67).
The Alavesen became blogestellt in the last and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced, that they would allow nobody, to remove the victory that they had earned minutes honestly in the first dreiig from them again.
Nonetheless resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team not and attempted to give strength to their team again through three points from the line (70-77).
In spite of that, and although splinter was put from the place because of fouls, the team of did not give up, defended itself well and although the Israelis caught up still in the last (80-85), the game had lost has already had a and Tel Aviv for the first time in this.
Injuries prevented that the forehead was offered to Unicaja
Unicaja lost loudly to Olympic cosines in Greece and had to hand over the leadership to him in the group B of the, and the one in a game that was characterized by the failure rates on the part of the from Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), particularly during the inside game, what facilitated the victory for the Greeks.
The team from Málaga was not yet afraid either of the opposing team before the atmosphere in the hall of the peace and the friendship, that maybe one the most powerful is and a great deal has.
Thanks to their presented game in first quarter the Andalusians were allowed to dream begin. An aggresive Verteidung and three successive triple, two of them through Omar Cook and one through Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth.
Olympic cosine was surprised from the intensity of the ereins Unicaja even if the local team with a got it between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis that the advertisement board indicated in the 13th minute 22-20 for their advantages the minute, in which it would almost have resulted in the fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and why both were disqualified.

After the most enticing days since last spring at which the inflation of was the predominating atmosphere on the markets the insecurity returned on the markets again, which is not surprising on certainly not since this is their natural in an environment, in which the brokers decisions hit more than one by nature unsure future.
It was the Manahme used for the stabilization of the markets to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and to let the liquidity indirectly free hand with interests that moves around the zero so that in this way the banks buy assets for the cashing up.
The central banks confirmed already that the direct purchases of assets that occurs next week are as good as ended and start without questioning their admire the policy to scattering some sand into the gear as it naec already showed the broadcasts with their year auction.
Therefore the investors doubt about the ability of the economical recovery without maintaining these heterodox Manahmen and we just become witnesses of a reversal during the reduction of the risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten of the stock exchanges and the differences at the Unternehmensboni climb again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts that reached it at the beginning of the.
The states saw themselves forced, to nationalize the private risks and the national debts go up again.

Spain was hardly until now affected by this episode of, but then standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision down concerning the evaluation of Spain.

It it does not turn any sense that Ecofin Hungary rescues from the non-fulfilment of their foreign payments at the beginning of the and concedes thus a euro member country not to follow his obligations anymore.
Against being transparent it is logical that Ecofin forced the Greek government to that and his citizens with the need for with into the duty to take in order to receive the stability of the public uprightly.
Yes, we are how that would be expected before an episode of normalizing of the risk premiums, after some excesses to large, now within the expected one.
In the case of Spain one must do no worries as long as the differences of the state indebtedness increase themselves with the same as the European.
The European should reduce themselves, however, and increase the Spanish wider, dannn it would be a question at that of a special Spanish.
That of standard & Poor's is a farce. during the local preferred indicators a Groteil of the market research agencies for this purpose force, to prefer their scenarios for the recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 up, einschlielich the OCDE and of the, that again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all promises that in spite of warnings a long.

The game at the champions League has Madrid and Barça since beginning 476,4 a million imported.
The champions League has sichseit their origin 1992 for a source of revenue for the Fuballclubsentwickelt.
So very much, that real Madrid and Barcelona since then 476,4 a million to have charmed, which is the third and fifth place of the Fuballclubs that earned money the most in the league to them worth.
Chief of this list is Manchester United.
Chief of this list is Manchester United.
To win the champions League of the UEFA does not bring only fame with themselves. She is also one of the main sources of revenue of the major.
The league has according to the UEFA up to 5.362,5 million euros onto the 105 teams (of that 12 Spanish), that at this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 teilnehmen,verteilt.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona profited from this distribution.
The weie club lies near third place of Europe, who earned money the most through his participation and that next to the AC Milan the only one that three times gained the trophy.
The Dutch Catalan and last winner of the former Europe cup 1992 occupies the fifth place.
The list mention Manchester United and Bavaria Munich, two teams, that auerdem also the most money through their participation in the last took.
And that, although they lost to Barça.
On the Other Hand Spain is only at third place of the countries, that through the champions einehmen money could, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bie Italy, three near England and two near Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained through the complicated money division procedure which uses the UEFA.
In this business year the organization calculates, whose chairmanship Michel Platini has inne, with gains of 1.090 million through the champions League.
From this money the UEFA plans 413,1 million for firm payments: each of the 20, who participated in the qualification qualifying round (among them the de) got 2,1 million.
Auerdem got those ones who erkämpften themselves a participation, 3,8 million through their bloe presence, in addition to the 550.000 euros for every game which they denied.
There is also the case for a for the winning (800 000) and for a draw (400.000 per team). In each case three million receive the clubs which came into the dividing into eight parts final; the four which came into to the, 3,3 million.
The last four get each 4 million.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the Second, of the 5,2 million keeps.
So a Fuballclub gets at least 7,1 million and at most 31,2 million at fixed gains.
In turn earned to Barça with his victory with the European supercup in 2,5 million.
However, still the variable payments for which 337,8 million are planned come for this purpose.
This money is assigned proportionally to the value of each individual.
The Spanish one belongs in this case to the first and has 4 assigned places.
The master of the last year receives 40 % of the assigned Gelds, 30 % the Second, of the second, 20 % and 10 % for the fourth.
The other part is distributed according to number of the games which they play during the this year's edition.
