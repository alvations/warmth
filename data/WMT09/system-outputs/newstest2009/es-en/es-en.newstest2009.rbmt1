The Bag of Praga finished with less points at the end of the day 
After the tomorrow's quick fall, the Bag of Praga corrected its losses. 
The transactions of the actions of ?EZ reached approximately half of value that you/they have in a normal day. 
The Bag of Praga, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, he/she reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it descended approximately to 6%. 
The slope of this time is due to the fall of the actions in Wall Street. 
The reaction of the market is also here expressed before the result of the voting of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the plan of the secretary's of the financial sector stabilization. 
Fall of the actions in Asia 
The actions of the Asian Bags lived on Tuesday a dramatic fall, although along the day the index attenuated part of the losses finally. 
The index of the Bag Hang Seng of Hong Kong along its financial day almost marked four percent, although later he/she attenuated its losses reducing the descent in practically 2,5 percent. 
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises that follows the movements of the Chinese actions in the Bag of Hong Kong 3,8 percent descended, in Shangai the markets were closed. 
The actions of the Bag of Sidney lost more than five percent but, at the end, the losses descended to 4,3 percent. 
The Bag of Taiwan according to the secretary of the Index descended to 3,6 percent. 
"The rescue actions programmed in USA are insecure and this influences from all over the world in the financial market", the Boss of the Office of the Currency of Hong indicated Kong, Joseph Yam. 
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, her sóla its monetary politics determines, that is to say, without dependence of the Central Bank of China. 
The interest rates of Hong Kong is at the same level like those of the United States. 
The American legislators meet as soon as possible again, according to the first Australian minister Kevin Rudd, and to approve a support proposal to the financial system. 
Otherwise, he/she threatens with which the falls will be made feel in other countries. 
Bloody bathroom of the American actions 
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan of help to the financial system to which you/they should be devoted 700 thousand million dollars (almost about 12 trillion crowns). 
The legislators, in that way, ignored the president's invitation George Bush to support their plan. 
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and he/she would help to stabilize the whole economy. 
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the index of the actions they picked up the biggest fall in more than 20 years. 
The index of Dow Jones lowered to almost seven percent. A fall of similar volume registered for last time in the year 1987. 
The index already descended before being announced but so soon it was shown that the proposal of the assembly didn't come out ahead, the index began to fall freely. 
The congress retires: The government of USA can inject 700 thousand million dollars in the banking 
The highest representatives in the Congress and of the government, the president George W. Bush, came to an agreement in a pact in wide terms of financial help to the American system of finances. 
Their voting will be carried out at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators caused a breach in the conversations on the approval of the rescue plan in their form of help to the American financial system with the quantity of 700 thousand million dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns). 
However, it is not still won. 
The congress members should tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it is voted. 
The plan of help to the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives. 
He/she said on Sunday to the agency Reuters, Barney Frank, president of the Committee for financial Services and of the Banking of the Assembly. 
According to some sources, the voting on the plan could not be carried out in the Senate before Wednesday. 
According to the economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first factor psychologically significant for the revitalización of the financial market. 
Then, however, you will arrive to the " desencantamiento " thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help to the market will also reach in the practice. 
Paulson: The plan should be effective 
"We have carried out a great advance. 
We solve our differing opinions with regard to the form that should have the package of measures for the stabilization of the market the democratic Nancy he/she commented Pelosiá to the agency Bloomberg. 
According to her, the final voting could still be carried out on Sunday. 
The legislators' representatives met on Sunday at night with the minister of finances, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form to the government's Fund. 
This should not buy of the financial societies the hypothecary assets sold that they take to the financial companies to hard losses and they threaten the stability of the whole system. 
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and it will also be effective in the market. 
It is necessary to still continue with the reparation plan, but I believe that we are already in it", Paulson said. 
A sign for the Asian business 
The global financial crisis impacts expressly in the market of actions that they lower quickly. 
According to the democratic senator for Nevada, Harry Laughs, the legislators are making all the possible one so that the Congress approves an agreement definitively this Sunday. 
They want with it to tranquilize the business of the investors since before the Asian market of finances these they are those that are in the first spindle schedule and where the Congress could influence in the trade of Monday. 
However, for the time being there is not anything clear with security on when they will vote the two cameras of the American Congress and, not even, if they won't stagnate in the last moment with some problem. 
The legislators believe that it will be approved in next days. 
The law, however, will suffer a series of changes. 
The total quantity dedicated to help to the system should be divided in two parts. 
The first 350 thousand millions have to be as soon as possible to disposition, such and like the president requested George Bush. 
However, the Congress can block the liberation of the remaining quantity if he/she had the impression that the program doesn't fulfill its function, what would be other 100 thousand million dollars and, later, of the last 350 thousand million dollars. 
Bush valued the advance of the meetings 
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but the Congress can overcome its veto for a majority of votes. 
In spite of these changes the basic idea of the program was conserved that it consisted on winning financial resources for the hypothecary holding repurchase of bad whose value fell because hundred of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying its mortgages. 
"We have worked everything. 
The Assembly of representatives would have to be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", the republican senator, Judd commented Gregg. 
Also the American president Bush is satisfied with the advance of the encounters. 
Their spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance of Saturday and that it values the zeal of both parts to stabilize our financial market and to protect our economy." 
Limitation of the armored contract 
The president of the bank Committee of the senate, Christopher Dodd, the negotiators' boss, said that the legislators decided about the responsibility of the money of the program for the protection of the taxes of the taxpayers of their losses, a closing aliviadora of the programmed plan of finances. 
The new law should also limit the calls armored contracts for directors of the participant societies of the program, and believe a committee that will have a control of the Fund. 
This would have to direct it the Ministry of Finances. 
"We have worked very difficultly in it, and we have carried out a great advance in address to the agreement that will work and that it will be effective for the market and for all the Americans", Paulson commented. 
The plan also has to help the proprietors of houses that have problems with its payments. 
The government would have to come to an agreement with the new payments of the mortgages that he buys with the purpose of to go down the monthly loads from the payments to the debtors' terms and to facilitate them that they can keep his houses. 
Marek: he/she helps psychological 
The proposed plan is, according to the boss economist of Native Finance, David Marek, a good idea that he/she will be carried out but quite difficult. 
"And it is for this reason that one doesn't know with what mechanism and to what price the problematic assets will be bought. 
This will be decisive for the allotment of the losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek said this week, for the servant iHNed.cz. 
That the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week it is not, according to Marek, so excellent. 
"Much more important it is that, already this week the congress members come to an agreement in their support and they give him their seen good all him before one can. 
This important and psychological agreement that you arrives to that approval it is, in these moments, the most important thing", Marek insisted. 
It fights armed: the Reproducer of MP3 against the motive. 
We advise him as choosing 
While almost all motive reproduces files of MP3, no reproducer of MP3 is able to make calls. 
What seems clear that it is better to only be bought the telephone. 
Enough reasons exist even this way like so that the man only acquires the reproducer. 
The election depends practically in the way of its use and of the future proprietor's demand. 
It will probably be difficult that he/she acquires the most modern record player to listen in him the last album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the other hand this type of musical products as they are the disks of LP they no longer leave, and in what refers to their quality it doesn't exist neither a single objective reason to continue buying them. 
If they crowd together in their bookcases the vinyl disks with music of art rock, jazz or blue, be probably dreaming, at least, with this record player type. 
This is that is to say the same thing with the music that is on the way, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3. 
And here price categories and quality exist. 
For some it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns in a reproducer, the same thing as for a lover of Pink Floyd that difficultly will prove the mercadillo helmets of to twenty crowns. 
Two ends, among which there is enough I space for each one. 
The election is wide. 
He/she also decides the duration of the battery 
Some of the best reproducers gets much more than only to reproduce music and even that that not even most of the motives. 
No current apparatus is as universal as the telephone. 
In front of the most elementary functions as telephoning, to send messages, it can reproduce music and videotape, to record both, he/she has a better or worse picture apparatus and until it can be able to navigate. 
And when we take in consideration the Smartphone and the PDA they will also have in their pocket a small computer. 
This is since a small miracle any refrigerator he/she knows how to make a parrillada and no television can photograph. 
The universality of the motives also brings us disadvantages. 
How many more functions use before in the motive the indicator of the screen it will be illuminated requesting to be recharged. 
And music's reproduction is one of the biggest energy greedy-gutses. 
Few are the motives that are able to reproduce music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less. 
In this sense, music's reproducers (especially the simplest) they have a bigger yield clearly. 
For that reason, keep in mind that the cheap motives won't reproduce more than two hours. 
If besides this, above, they constantly call gets you still, for more security, a loader for the work - this is valid also for the most expensive apparatuses. 
With the reproducer of MP3 this problem won't have it, because the worst even tolerates as minimum 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load. 
Another problem happens when recording music in the motive. 
A part of the apparatuses unfortunately only has the universal connector USB and, also, not all they can be connected directly to the computer without a special software. 
Of course that it is possible to record music directly by heart in the card but only in some units readers without reduction the small cards can be connected by heart that they are used in the motives. 
In the reproducers, with some exception (iPod), it is not necessary any special software. 
Coarse with filling the apparatus with music through the USB of the computer. 
Most of motives and reproducers believe alone their order in the musical library according to the interpreter's name, title of the album, gender or also according to user's valuation. 
Some apparatuses only show a directory with similar tree structure to a Searcher of Windows and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the intelligent telephones with operating system). 
The reproducer tries to serve, the motive knows more 
For the election of a concrete team is interested in the resistance of the accumulator, for the capacity of the memory, for the quality and the type of sound exit and, of course, for the comfort of their handling. 
If he/she listens, mainly, the music like bottom and he/she will only listen to it every day a while, like in the tram, then he has enough with any motive that reproduces. 
That that practically truly gets any motive. 
He/she should not not even be interested of the format in which the motive or the reproducer reproduce the music. 
The MP3 reproduces it all and, practically, the whole music that arrives him will almost be in this format. 
It is among the most extended and excepting him most absolute of the apparatuses they reproduce music in format WMA. 
The less ones include the format AAC (format used by the company Apple and their iPod). 
The best motives also facilitate, for example, on-line music's purchase. 
Coarse by means of the internet of the motive to visit the competent pages of the operator (or of any other lender of services) and to be bought a song or an album. 
This service could be by itself an argument of weight to acquire a motive for music. 
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and most is limited alone to the topics of fleeting success of the radios. 
The prices neither are the lowest. 
However, in general, it is supposed that in fact this way of music sale (either for GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future it will dominate the music's industry. 
Most of people always take above a motive. 
Whenever he feels like listen something, it will find the motive in their pocket, while the reproducer of MP3 will be forgotten at home. 
However, it still depends if it takes I always get some headphones or, at least, the handsfree. 
If it is not this way, it can use an integrated reproducer that he/she has each motive practically although it is as minimum a reproducer of MP3. 
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the motives with music will be its price. 
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand you crown he/she can already acquire a good walkman. 
To most of you it will limit them the absence of an entrance for classic headphones. 
The best, even in what refers to the technical part, as the telephones equipped with an entrance of 3,5 mm. for some classic headphones, they cost up to fifteen thousand. 
Again, the advantage of the reproducers is not another thing that its easy service. 
The simplest reproducers - in no way necessarily the cheapest (to see our selection) - it really manages them any person. 
The minimum functions, their similar handling to the previous average casetes or also to the record player it is evident. 
It doesn't represent a threat in the sense that for mistake we connect ourselves to internet with the motive and, in consequence, gigantic bill for slope of data. 
For which apparatus to decide 
Even the cheapest motives (for example, the Vodafone 527) they have for general rule a slot to change the card by heart (type M2, micro SD, etc.). 
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card it will arrive to the two thousand crowns. 
However, be careful. 
The basic models, they are usually equipped only with a card of 2 GB of maximum capacity. 
The most expensive only have a memory of 8 GB. 
If he/she already has a motive and he/she still wants to be bought a cheap reproducer of MP3, toss a glance to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
According to the capacity (as maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to wear out more than 1.100 crowns. 
If it is considered of among the music's more demanding lovers it tosses hand of those motive-walkman specialized (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These apparatuses have independent keys for the MP3 that he/she makes such a comfortable service as the one of oneself reproducer. 
The specialized of all is Sony Ericsson whose motives of the line walkman have almost identical use as that of a reproducer of independent MP3. 
The same service and the same category as for price, on the four thousand crowns, but with a bigger capacity by heart (up to 16 GB) and of accumulator (usually of 15 hours, with a maximum yield of up to 35 hours), the mentioned mark more it lowers them he/she brings reproducers of MP3. 
The first virtual operator will already arrive, this year, to the Czech Republic. 
Probably 
The market of motives in the Czech Republic enough developed is and our operators offer all the services like their partners from western Europe practically. 
However, here we lack still something - the virtual operator that he/she would force those to be cheaper. 
It won't probably take in arriving. 
That the Czech operators are part of the most expensive of Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz. 
The rest also confirmed it the Office of the Czech Telecommunication (?TÚ) that alerted that the price of the messages SMS in our country is of the most expensive in the whole Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of the roaming rates you arrives probably to a paradoxical situation - for some clients of the Czech mobile operators the SMS that send from the foreigner will be cheaper than if they send them from house. 
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic stay so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, it lacks competition that he/she really wants to fight. 
Probably this seems us paradoxical, because we have three nets of motives and their high covering is of more than 100%. 
On the contrary, the operators of motives like of complaining that in the Czech market there is an extreme competition. 
Of it also the president of the Council of the Office of Czech Telecommunications (?TÚ), Pavel Dvo?ák, already expressed that there is no longer place in the Czech Republic for any other operator. 
It is maybe true that for a classic operator with their own net no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency). 
However, it still exists a possibility - the virtual operator. 
In fact the entrance of the virtual operator in the market of the mobile telephony brought an outstanding descent of prices before that which you/they should also react the classic operators. 
At the same time, still before the entrance of sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market of Great Britain similar voices were listened so much there as here. 
It was demonstrated that place exists for this type of operators and that they can be successful. 
Apart from this, it is not necessary to look for examples too far. 
In February of this year we inform them on the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half year, this operator was able to obtain more than 100 thousand clients and to become the fifth bigger operator of the neighboring country. 
On the other hand, after Mobilking he/she is the group Penta that, apart from it, in the Czech Republic he/she is the proprietor of U:fon. 
The advantage of the virtual operators is in the possibility of concentrating on many more concrete groups goal. 
Also, so that they can work in an effective way, they have enough with many less clients than a classic operator. 
They don't take I get relatively big expenses in construction, operation and maintenance of the net. 
In the world this type of virtual operators is usually profiled with low expenses - they offer calls and messages of cheap SMS that however, often it is counteracted with the offer of adjusted services. 
This way, Tesco motive in Great Britain offers SMS like minimum for example, half of cheap with regard to the competition. 
However, like sample the example of Mobilking in Poland can also be a good blow the bet for an anything trivial group it puts. 
This operator goes to the man specifically. 
"The correct man Mobilking chooses - it is the operator that it likes and who it can trust", David Seibert says, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company that this virtual operator works. 
It is difficult to say if similar concept like that of Poland could hook in our country. 
Of the spokesman of Vodafone he/she doubts it, Miroslav ?epický: "The Czech market is relatively small to consent for segments in which you/they are based most of the virtual operators. 
Also from the point of view of the offer of services it is relatively saturated" 
In the Czech Republic there are not possibilities, they say the operators of motives 
However, it seems almost sure that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator that it won't be Mobilking. 
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. it doesn't seem too much esperanzador. 
Rather it is the launching of Mobilking in other countries of our region", he/she said in phone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studni?ková, spokesman of the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly it assured that the current operators of mobile telephony in the Czech Republic definitively don't lean in the face of this idea. 
Rather the opposite, they try to make all the possible one so that any potential competition doesn't arise. 
Interest on the launching of a virtual operator of motives already shows it the group GTS Novera that wanted to take a step later on to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of the clients of companies. 
"We have a great interest in it, to be able to not only offer our clients services of fixed telephony but also of mobile telephony. 
And how much before, better. 
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all the Czech operators of mobile telephony. 
With some of them we have been able to advance in the meetings", the spokesman of the group, Pavel Kaidl said. 
Then, they maybe flash better times. 
It seems to be that, for non official information, the first official operator would have to possibly already arrive at the end of year. 
But for the time being their appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence. 
"In these moments we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market. 
The Czech market in comparison with other is a very specific market. 
Until the present nobody has gone to us with some complex and serious project in this land", did it express for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sr?e?, spokesman of Telefónica O2. 
Of the specificity of the Czech market they refer other operators. 
The spokesman of T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with the opinion of O2, adds: "Until today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, it can continue being developed." 
And he/she adds: "In the net of T-Mobile it will be difficult to find some virtual operator until final of year. 
At this time already we should have on the table some concrete contract that was possible to study in so short horizon" 
Vodafone directs its attention rather to the execution of the requirements characteristic of a license 3G. 
Miroslav ?epický adds: "We are open to the negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in what refers to the allotment of expenses and infrastructure. 
We in fact consider it as the biggest contribution from the point of view of the clients. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field is in the partner with the one who to establish a net shared for a quick internet in the motive." 
Responsible offices - with the operators fingernail and meat 
The progress of the operators of motives can be understood easily, but the entrance of another operator would mean to increase the competition what would bear to a slope of prices and with it, to a descent of the earnings. 
Then why to facilitate the entrance to the competition? 
When the operators want to get something, they are able to throw of oneself rope, it proves of it is it the agarrón when U:fon arose. 
Maybe the biggest pressure to the ?TÚ was in the moment of the entrance of U:fon for the society T-Mobile. 
He/she attests it the accessible public information in the pages web of the ?TÚ. 
But precisely now U:fon serves like argument of why not to accept a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová adds this: "Also, he/she doesn't make a lot that the competitive atmosphere in the market of the mobile telephony went open to a fourth operator. 
In what refers to the character of the market of the mobile telephony in the Czech Republic it is natural that the entrance of another player in the market would suppose for him and, mainly, for its services big requirements." 
It is for this reason that this access to the operators of motives is tremendously desalentador due to the absolute indifference of the organ Czech regulator. 
It only is not the posture of the ?TU, the one which unfortunately doesn't have any competition in intervening in the commercial bids, contrary to Great Britain and other developed countries. 
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Bids (ÚOHS). 
However, this expressed their typical posture before this problem. 
"The entrance of a virtual operator to the market of the mobile telephony would be possible after closes an agreement on the rent of the necessary infrastructure between an operator of mobile telephony and a virtual operator. 
Until today no agreement has been closed the offer of the interested potentials since rather it was not the sufficiently interesting thing for the classic operators", he/she added to our question Kristián Barge, of the department of external Relationships of the ÚOHS. 
These formulated declarations don't surprise the representatives of the operators. 
For the offices that should represent the interests of the consumers it is something more than a consideration, apart from they should observe it that nobody takes advantage of their position in the market. 
Especially when Kristián Barge adds: "Abroad where the virtual operators work with normality we can observe that its entrance in the market contributed to the slope of prices of the services of mobile telephony" 
Evidently, the pressure as for the correct operation of the means of the market and the slope of prices doesn't enter inside the interest of the ÚOHS. 
Really the dramatically provoking thing in this whole case rests in the dissonant reactions that are of the three mobile operators. 
The question of if it is really a chance, he/she offers by itself. 
It is the same thing as with the price of the gasoline in the gas stations because it is clear that it is work of the chance and of a hard fight for the competition. 
"The Office in this sense has not found signs of disloyal competition and he/she doesn't have reasons therefore it stops somehow to intervene. 
None of the operators has a dominant position consequently they don't have a corresponding ascent of responsibility in their performances in the market. 
The necessary tools to open the market from the mobile telephony to the virtual operators, rather, lack, as well as the telecommunication regulators", he/she added to their answer Barge. 
The interpretation on the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points. 
Evidently an analysis of excellent markets elaborated by the ?TÚ according to which the telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial bid an only market exists. 
In this type of having bought none of the Czech operators naturally has a dominant position. 
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - so that a virtual operator arises it is always necessary the agreement with the administrator of the net. 
And the operator of the mobile telephony - with all their logic - he/she has the monopoly of their net. 
Therefore, in a concrete segment it should be necessarily dominant. 
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should represent a warning the fact that three operators of motives ascend garishly in a similar way. 
The current complaints of the interested ones (inluida the mentioned society GTS Novera) they show that in all the negotiations with the operators are collided with many similar impediments. 
To load the responsibility in the ?TÚ is a quite common trick in the field of the telecommunications of which the ÚOHS is washed the hands in this whole matter. 
We have already met with him in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately recently time a new amendment was presented to the law of telecommunications for the amplification of the competition of the ?TÚ in the field of the commercial bids that was not taken to effect, still when a series of specialists promised that the situation would improve. 
This should know it perfectly the representatives of ÚOHS, but it is evident that their interests are in another part. 
Everything goes well, when nobody looks 
At the same time, desapercibidamente continues working something like that as an operator pseudovirtual that in the Czech nets of mobile telephony some already exist. 
They are companies that put their own prices to the services of mobile telephony that, however, a part is only public. 
It is usually companies that are devoted to the marketing multinivel. 
Amway, Bohemian Telecom, Starlife and other many offer their own services of mobile telephony. 
Some elects usually only get the list of prices of these companies. 
The magic is in that the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic managerial client of the same one taking charge a great quantity of cards SIM. 
As special client he/she will receive special prices and other offers later. 
The problem is in that the commercial conditions in all the Czech operators of telephony mobile prohíben that resale type. 
"If they were discovered cases like those that he/she makes an appointment could speak of infraction under the contract conditions that could be translated in the end of the collaboration with the given society", he/she responded to the question on this problem Martina Kemrová. 
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this type carried out on the part of the operators of mobile telephony didn't arrive to responsible people. 
In fact in the case of the three mentioned companies it can end up being clients' thousands. 
None of the operators is against this procedure. 
With the activities of these companies they obtain some earnings anything worthless and, at the same time - contrary to the authentic virtual operators - in no way they threaten their own official marketing. 
Miroslav ?epický notices us of the possible problems: "the law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are only used by a despicable so much percent of clients. 
These, also, they should accept that the card SIM of its telephone is not to its name for what you/they cannot have him absolutely as a normal client of the operators." 
In fact this is what should seem the ?TÚ minimumly strange. 
A new question also appears for the ÚOHS. 
If it is that the operators of mobile telephony half-close the eyes in this procedure type, why do they block the entrance of the virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has the enough competition to discover this type of activities and if it is that he/she won't want he/she should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they don't have neither he/she devises of this history and that its commercial conditions don't allow it. 
When we will stop to be the most expensive 
As it was already clear in the text, the entrance of the virtual operator in the market of the mobile telephony brought a significant descent in the prices of the services. 
At the same time, practically in all the countries where the virtual operator arose, the classic operators tried more or less to be protected of this irruption. 
The arguments used for these they were practically all identical ones - too small, a market, possibly, too much saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc. 
In the most advanced countries, however, in these moments the organs regulators have intervened and in none of the cases they defended the operators but to their clients. 
Already outside with formal measures or informal pressure they achieved that the first virtual operator arose and with him they began to arise other more. 
Unfortunately, the Czech Organ of Regulation this whole case passes it as if it was a nail afire. 
For our experience we cannot stop to impress ourselves that they need the confusion of the attributions in these cases. 
But let us don't despair. 
If it is that this information among wings is correct and the virtual operator really arrives to these lands, then the Czech market of the mobile telephony probably begins to move again. 
If some of the operators allows to enter to some virtual operator of mobile telephony it will be difficult that the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested ones. 
And we maybe will stop to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official hymn. 
On Sunday, the first minister Mirek Topolánek at times of the day of the Czech official celebrations it presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home. 
The new hymn recorded it the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Ji?í B?lohlávek. 
There is to disposition four versions - two versions that are Alone, one to masculine voice and another to feminine voice, another with Choir and another instrumental one. 
Of the song Kate?ina does take charge Kn? ?ínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn Otakar Jeremiá? and Jaroslav Kr?ek. 
In the servant iHNed.cz can listen the four versions. 
B?lohlávek considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
The Czech Radio already said before deliberately he/she chose representatively for the Single singers with voices young that are more expressive and more popular. 
"From the beginning I have attempted with both and later, also, with the Choir that you/they noticed the diction so that the text was well understood, so that he/she had consonance", he/she commented. 
The Czech official hymn takes place next year its 175 anniversary. 
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in the year 1834 in the charts of the Theater of the States in the original Czech Fidlova?ka of Josef it works Kajetán Tyl and orderly with the music of Franti?ek ?kroup. 
It won popularity and people made it his. 
The first verse of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 became, in a natural way, in a part of the official hymn. 
One of the seven official symbols even remained after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic. 
How it sounds the new hymn 
The MHD of Praga takes us for the first time on Wednesday with the chip 
On Wednesday, October of 2008, 1 are written in the history of the Company of Transports of Praga the date in which the first passengers enter to the meter, to the tram and the bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper note. 
This can be acquired in these moments for almost a hundred thousand people that possess the chip card Opencard. 
The passengers can buy the voucher of 30 days, 90 days and the annual one (this will be been worth starting from January 1 2009) and simultaneously to load it in their chip card in the infocentros and positions of the company of transports in the stations of the Meter, Muzeum, M?stek, Nádra?í Hole?ovice, And?l, Roztyly, Let?any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Ka?erov and Luka. 
The funds can already be bought from yesterday in internet in the pages of the company of transports, www.dpp.cz. 
The service, until the afternoon, it was used for more than four hundred people. 
Those that begin to use the internet like trade form, can begin definitively to forget the positions of sale of notes in the stations of the meter, where up to now regularly should make line to be taken out a normal note. 
The voucher is bought in internet, and the card Opencard they recharge it to you in some of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library. 
"In these places there is to the passengers' disposition a window with prepared personnel that helps to the interested ones with the purchase for internet and also with the recharge of the voucher bought in their card", the spokesman of the project, Martin Opatrný said. 
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher in the Opencard in the machines automatic expendedoras that are in some lobbies of the meter. 
How are these machines expendedoras? 
They are red, they remind us to a machine of chopping notes and the travelers will probably already have noticed them in the stations of the meter of Roztyly, Bud?jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Now there is in the city five but at the end of year he/she would have to have eighty", Opatrný completed. 
The voucher is controlled by the machine instead of the driver 
The use of the machine that will begin to work tomorrow, is simple. 
Coarse with introducing in her the chip card Opencard and the previously paid voucher will only be loaded in her. 
The electronic funds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in their surroundings. 
That is to say, in the circumvallation trains and lines of buses from the numbers 300 up to 499 that mainly the inhabitants of central Bohemian's towns use. 
"In the trains attributed to the integrated transport of Praga there are reviewers equipped with a card reader that he/she will help to confirm the validity of the time and the area of the voucher", he/she explained this way the control of the notes, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that settles down the schedules of the collective transport of Praga. 
The circumvallation buses have their cards readers mounted in the driver's box office. 
When entering it is necessary only not to show the card to the driver but it is also necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place dedicated for it in the side of the Box. 
With it, the driver controls the validity of the voucher. 
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the funds there is not nothing else easy that to request the driver this information", Drápal completed. 
The passengers that don't travel in the circumvallation buses and don't remember when it is they it finishes the validity of the voucher they can go to the machines expendedoras where the cards are recharged. 
Here, in the screen of the machine, they will be shown the information about the validity of their document. 
The southeast wanted to be part of USA in a referendum 
The German Sudetes requested in the year 1945 that he/she Smoked it was part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted of the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemian of the South. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this desire they went, presumably, some groups of German of the Sudetes to the president of USA in the year 1945. 
It is of the letters that stay in a particular file and that today they are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemian of the South. 
The Germans of ?eský Krumlov requests in a letter to the American president that doesn't allow the refund of the earth ?umava" - occupied by Hitler based on the Pact of Munich - again to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want their word that the American units are arriving to German lands I don't eat oppressors neither enemies but I eat liberadores it is written in the letter, signed with a people that takes the destination of ?umava in their heart." 
In view that the union of Czechoslovakia with the German southeast presumably supposes - according to these the character national Czech - an alone hope in the brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors request in the letter to the American president that assumes per today and forever to ?umava under a protectorate. 
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants he/she gives us to a foreign state that oppresses and it rejects to the minorities and that at all it collaborates with the victory of the allies", it is written in the letter. 
The reason for which the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear to the Czech oppressors' reprisals." 
If the president of USA presumably doubted about this idea of the German ?umavos, it would be enough with organizing in the lands ?umavas a referendum on if his inhabitants want to be part of USA or to live under his patronage. 
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge that we have current of the postwar period history, it can sound a little infantile, according to some specialists spot correctly the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of then. 
Although the Czech Germans should sense minimumly that it will be on their expulsion of the republic some few ones they only admitted this possibility. 
Some hoped the United States and Great Britain negotiated for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy. 
Others believed that they will stay in Czechoslovakia. 
It even confirms it the Austrian journalist Gustav Barge, born in ?eské Bud?jovice. 
This was in the war, as German of Bud?jovice, signed up in the marine of the Baltic one. 
When at the end of the war the Britons captured it and they summoned him in the field of prisoners of Holstein dozens of Germans they went to him so that Czech taught them. 
"They believed that when returning home, the Czech would come them well", he said Barge. 
None of the German prisoners that you/they lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted with which based on the Ordinances of Benes they would be far from the Republic. 
You don't think - pays! 
Moving campaign attacks the drivers 
The most expensive action in the Czech history directed to the security in the highways. 
In that way you could characterize the moving Campaign that he/she decided to rush on Wednesday the Ministry of Transports in the means. 
The minister office, Ale? ?ebí?ek promises that it will discourage the drivers of dangerous behaviors to the steering wheel. 
The campaign of 150 millions will be made feel in television, radio, cinema, internet and in pamphlets. 
He/she would have to discourage the driver of the high speed and of the alcohol to the steering wheel. 
And also to remind them that before starting they abide the belts. 
He/she wants to arrive mainly to the conscience of the conductive youths, motorists, pedestrians and in last place also of the professional drivers. 
And what is what we can see in the announcements? 
Fundamentally human histories that charge to the emotions. 
And for it they attest it to us the sanguinary announcements during the whole campaign: 
You don't think - pays! 
The word doesn't think" it is written with big letters in the registration. 
And the word " pays " is in a puddle of blood. 
This should symbolize that the man in a moment of it misleads he/she can end up paying with their own life. 
The announcements will put fear to the spectators until the year 2010. 
The Ministry allowed to be inspired for the campaign made in Anglo-Saxon lands where victims' of accidents strong images can be observed. 
He/she promises that in that way it will reduce the accidents and the number of dead in the Czech highways. 
The announcements have been elaborated by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for the drivers 
"For the drivers voucher the system of sugar and whip. 
Sugar is for him when, for example, he/she spends a traffic light in red and it saves this way time. 
The whip is ticket threat or accident. 
To the drivers it should be remembered the risks", the psychologist of transports of the hospital Na Homolce says, Martin Ko?án. 
And for that reason it is necessary an informative campaign in the press and mainly a negative, concrete publicity the psychologist. 
Less effective, for him, they are the panels that you/they notice to the driver of the dangers. 
"If there is some installed panel noticing probably soon of some danger he/she will fuse with the atmosphere and the driver won't pay him bigger attention", Ko?án noticed. 
Olmert would almost return all the busy areas in exchange for the peace 
The president of the provisional government from Israel, Ehud Olmert, was pronounced on the restitution of practically all the lands occupied in the year 1967, that is to say, Cisjordania, Jerusalem this and the High of the Golán, in exchange for the peace with Palestinian and Syrian. 
It proposed in the interview that on Monday Ahronoth appeared in the daily Yedioth. 
"We should reach an agreement with the Palestinian what means that we will necessarily restore almost all the lands (busy) if it is that not all", Olmert said to the newspaper. 
"For sure we will keep a so much percent of these lands, but to the Palestinian we will give them a similar percent (of the lands of Israel) because without this there won't be peace", he/she added. 
It admitted that in the event of restitution it would also be included Jerusalem this. 
"That that wants security in Jerusalem and therefore don't want that the tractors or diggers pass above their legs like it passed one of my best friends, then he/she will have to give a part of Jerusalem", Olmert pointed in reference to the two attacks of July in the city in those that there were several deads and dozens of people were hurt. 
According to the president it will be necessary to find a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historical place that is inside the old city. 
"That that wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty in the whole city will have to integrate 270.000 Arab. 
This won't work", he/she insisted later on. 
Retreat of the High ones of the Golán 
Olmert was also pronounced by the retreat of Israel of the High ones of the Golán what is an inherent condition to close an agreement of peace with Syrian from its point of view. 
But this would also suppose some concrete efforts on the part of Damask. 
"I don't intend to only close the peace with Syrian in the base of the retreat of the Golán", he/she noticed. 
"The Syrians know well of what they will have to come off to win the Golán. 
They will abandon their current relationships with Iran, they will abandon their relationships with the Hizbulá (movement chita), they will come off of the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (movement chita), of To the Qaeda (the terrorist net) and of the Yihad (the Guerra Santa) in Iraq", the first minister summed up. 
Questions after the accident: Are the stewardesses illegal in the buses? 
The law is ignored, one cannot walk in a bus of long distance 
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova arises us the question of if the stewardesses and passengers can move for the bus during the trip. 
"If we wanted strict and formally to fulfill the law, the stewardess's activity is opposed to the law of traffic vial", the spokesman of the ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka says. 
The accident in which the twenty-two year-old stewardess died last week, evidently you/he/she was only caused by the driver of the truck the bus she crossed in the road. 
The girl, unfortunately, was seated beside the driver in the less sure place of the vehicle in spite of having reserved other two places. 
However, the bus can have an accident or to brake all of a sudden, and in the precise moment in that the azafato distributes the coffee or the newspapers. 
Here what plays the paper is if the bus is gifted, according to the technical permission, with places of on foot. 
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger should go sat down. 
The buses of long distances of Student Agency doesn't have places to go of foot, what the director of the company, Radim confirmed Jan?ura, to Aktuáln? .cz. 
"This has solved it with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of the passengers is not allowed. 
Finally this retired it and we reach the agreement that the passengers can go to the bathroom being in progress the bus if it is that they possess seat", he/she commented us their position. 
The stewardess doesn't know the law 
"An evident legal interpretation of the stewardess's paper doesn't exist - no legal disposition clarifies this function. 
Not even any disposition legal prohíbe to the agents of transports to carry out some service. 
The law of transport by lorry only knows Reviewer's of vehicles term whose rights and obligations are not defined", he/she adds, less tajantemente, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the department of Traffic of vehicles by lorry of the Ministry of Transports, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law assists this problem sufficiently. 
"It depends of if the bus has the approval allowed to have places of on foot. 
That is everything", he/she says. 
The buses are divided among the urban ones, where there are places to be standing and of limited maximum speed, intercity with places to be standing with a bigger permission of speed and those of long distances without places to go of foot, with the biggest permission of speed and with the seats equipped with belt of security. 
As in the airplane, the expert says 
The expert of BESIP in Security in the transport, Jaroslav Ho?ín, doesn't see important problems as for the movement of the azafato in the bus. 
"During the development of the trip there is not a lot of threat of danger, the situation you can compare with the service in the airplanes. 
One not even here has the security that the turbulences arrive and that the stewardess you can hit in the head." 
"However, if the bus brakes all of a sudden evidently that they are valid the physical laws. 
The same thing as in an urban bus or in the tram. 
The stewardess's security should solve it the internal regulation of the transport one", he/she says and he/she also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is without solving. 
Jan?ura is prepared to annul this service 
Student Agency is the only transport company that he/she offers the service of stewardesses. 
It uses in him at two hundred. 
The director, neither after the accident, it considers that chancy work. 
"However, in the moment in that he/she has the impression that stewardess's position is chancy, then I will suppress it. 
The coffee and the newspapers can receive it, the passengers, when entering. 
It would even save expenses", he/she says. 
In interest to the security is the reason for which Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin that directs a small line in comparison with INC. 
"We don't have stewardesses, we are from the beginning against them. 
Before or later this will finish in a mortal accident", he/she said less than one year ago for Týden.cz. 
An enormous tragedy happened 
In the accident of the line that unites Naples a young stewardess of Pilsen that had worked for the company two years died. 
A truck esloveno that probably rotated from the parking rail blocking the step to the bus. without using the intermittent ones. 
Their driver attempted in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, it collided with the front right part. 
Jan?ura denies that they were sold the two places that are reserved for the stewardess's rest. 
"These places are not possible to reserve them for connections of long distances, they are blocked." 
The company has the intention of demanding the driver of the truck. 
The agency won't wait to the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but wait the financial expenses also for the culprit's part. 
Does it reform of the law? 
No, for the time being 
The reformation of the law could bring a bigger precision on the stewardess's movement in the bus in the one which for one year that thirty expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transports are working. 
"However, they have not reached some concrete conclusion. 
They are not devoted too much to the buses, but rather to the system of points, maximum speed in freeway and the use of the motive during the march", the expert Ho?ín says. 
"The Ministry of Transport doesn't consider the activity of the stewardesses something that threatens in an important way the security of the passengers", finishing the spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of the security in the buses is competition of the police and the Office of Security in the work. 
The hope of Dusseldorf leans on in Francfort 
In the letter of the directive meeting of the bank West LB for its collaborators doesn't lack big words. 
For the coalition of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA central bought `Un of capitals of the financial group of Sparkassen' can be formed, as he/she tells it the writing, published on Monday 
The bank West LB, breaking up the competencia' `Bloco with sustainable capacity of benefits would enter in such a business. 
Also, a such coalition can be a beginning for following coalitions in the environment of regional banks. 
He/she ends up this way understanding the text, when a directive meeting wants to show capacity to act in hard times. 
Because the same as before the West LB is low an enormous pressure. 
Not alone of the part of the European Union, but also of the federal institute of the surveillance of the financial services that recently has made clear to the government of the Renania of the North-Westfalia that is little time to find a solution. 
Already for a time, also of the part of Francfort, a lot of envelope the union of such a type is spoken among the bank DEKA that the clients of Sparkasse know for their investment funds, and the West LB. 
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the boss of the bank DEKA, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August allowed to know that you don't see any sense in the coalition of the bank, located in the street Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank as for example the one Froze or the West LB. 
But the advice of administration of the DEKA that now is compound for the regional banks and the associations of Sparkassen, he/she took charge to directive meeting to begin negotiations with the West LB on the common commercial activities. 
In this it could be a business in the market of capitals or some parts of him. 
The negotiations have just begun of course, it is said this way in the financial place. 
It is not the first time when it is the consolidation in the environment of Sparkassen the name of the bank he/she appears DEKA that with their 3000 collaborators figure among more important managers in the financial place Francfort. 
In 2003 in a moment the situation seemed the bank so DEKA it could fuse with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinado and with the one it Froze. 
This initiative of creating an union of three parties was without results. 
The plans became hardly public, the government of Hesse was expressed against the participation of the one it Froze in this project. 
The other two banks didn't also find the same language. 
Instead of that the regional bank of the Renania-Palatinado began the I dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg. 
But it was always played again with the idea of coalition of the bank DEKA with other regional banks. 
But lastly Günther Merl, the president of the directive meeting of the one Froze, it expressed that it was against of the plans of the coexistence with his bank. 
Independent of that it seems to be more undoubtedly the union of the different banks of the environment of public right it is necessary. 
Well, when they will pass the elections of the parliament of Baviera, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progresses. 
For the one it Froze that it is not necessarily a good news. 
If the pressure to continue fusing will increase, to it Froze the partners he will lack them to carry out that. 
In the south the bank could be alone a young partner, although up to now it stood out more good of the financial crisis than they made it the properties of Stuttgart and Munich. 
Of another part the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia that possesses 85 percent of the one Froze, at the beginning of the year it avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB. 
In any event it is alone the Nord LB. 
But such reflections geoestratégicas form they are alone a part. 
Of another part it is the compatibility of the different bank models. 
In June Merl asked a fundamental question on a commercial model that could guarantee the future for the regional banks to that the deutsche Sparkassen - und Turn - Verband up to now didn't give any answer. 
In final the West can break down LB, but that, naturally, is not the own desire of the bank. 
This way, also in the letter of the directive meeting of the bank it is said that it would be attempted to find a complete solution for the whole bank 
As you it can page the coexistence among singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest it is known as the weekend of the Italians" 
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth. 
But this time, to him you attended him Elena like their girlfriend, and for that reason everything seems different, he says.

To go! To go and to occupy the places of behind in the store of the campaign. 
" Don't take the places of before, because we will block, and all with yellow caps don't sit down in the same stool, distributed by all space!"

Don't forget the tip

It is wanted to be able to recognize the road behind.

The police of Munich receives seven policemen's of the autonomous County of Bolzano help, Italian volunteers help the Red Cruz of Baviera that makes a statistic of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical attendances, before the Englishmen (near 60 attendances) and of the Austrians they occupy the first place.

The nights without sleeping for those worthy of the Real Hypo you are 
The bank system of Germany is relatively stable, it accentuated alone last week the federal minister of Finances Peter Steinbrück. 
That well that the politician used the word relatively and he added that the German bank environment will also be affected of the critical tendencies. 
And that has happened after weekend. 
Real Hypo you is (HRE), the financier of properties of Munich that is quoted in the index DAX, receives from a consortium of the German banks a credit of a thousand millions to be able to make resistance to the turbulences in the market. 
On Monday a person that knows the situation very well said to Reuters: the credit help ascended up to 35 thousand million euro. 
The part of the capital that the Real Hypo you is will use he/she has to throw interest. 
The money comes as of the private banks also of those of public right. 
The cause of that is the losses of the filial Depfa. 
According to a report, the state financiers with the money that was lent for the long term projects financed them alone a brief period - that that now, because of the distrust in the markets, it is not more possible. 
In the first half of the year the reservation of capital of the bank cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euro, the quota of the own capital also put back some 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent. 
In comparison with the same period of the last year the continuous revenues of financial investments and net profits of financial operations fell until the zero, the imputation revenues for debtors and some titles of values those of the breakup of provisions of the credit business also spread to the drop of more than 70 percent, in 5 million euro. 
Alone thanks to the high and many revenues of the refunds of the expenses of compensation of the restructuring of the former-group Depfa as well as to the refund of interests according to the federal code of taxes and to the organized business for the companies of the consortium, the debit could accuse a deficit with approximately to 16 more percent. 
After their privatization in the year 1990 the former state financier at the beginning got lost in speculations with the industrial credits for the properties, what served as reason for foundation of the bank Aareal. 
As you it could not make a lot of money with the financing of the state projects, the Defa began to be devoted intensively to the projects in the infrastructure environment and of the financing of the community projects for the private investors and as well as estatales(Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and it was diversified. 
Now the Real Hypo is he/she has to be carried out paying-offs about the value of the branch that will have an essential material effect on the consolidated bill of losses and earnings of the group, are said very imprecisely. 
It is a fact that you/they have canceled the dividends. 
Already for the year 2007 they were canceled to two thirds. 
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Real Hypo you is he/she became an important one financial state and financial in the environment of the infrastructure. 
As the bank it doesn't possess the deposits client, he, in comparison with other banks, turns out to be more dependent of the refinanciación in the market interbancario. 
With the crash of the bank of American investment Lehman Brothers, what has happened two weeks ago, the concession of the credits interbancarios lowered essentially because the banks were saving its liquidity. 
Every year the Real Hypo you is he/she almost needs 50 thousand million Eurus to finance a part of wallets of credit of the Defa of its short term measures for the refinanciación. 
You are according to the report of the Real Hypo, the bank covers with a credit the necessity of the financing of the group for a brief time and the company is assured of the influence of the international monetary markets that now essentially are not capable to work" 
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinanciación is guaranteed until the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, the president of the directive meeting of the Real Hypo you is, he explained that the Real Hypo is you Group he/she would not need the monetary markets for the foregone time. 
The German central bank and the federal institute of the surveillance of the financial services (BaFin) they portion of the base that the competitiveness of the Real Hypo is you Group starting from now it is assured. 
That has to wait the shareholders and those worthy of the bank. 
But because of the dynamics and of the imponderabilidad of the crisis there is not perseverance. 
It is even imaginable that he/she is not necessary to need the financing in their complete volume. 
But you cannot exclude the contrary case. 
He/she ran the voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, for that reason the temporary salvation neither can tranquilize at least concerned people. 
The action price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 Eurus. 
The loan courses, on the contrary, are really well. 
While the high-priority debts hardly change, the courses of the loans according to the position in the registration of the property spread clearly to the drop. 
Affected they are mainly the loans of the former filial Württemberg Hypo and with the reason the loans whose expirations surpass 2009. 
You are after the remarkable growth of the bank crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that the Real Hypo affected, the current value of its loans that before were an investment for speculations it is necessary to consider as clerk of the stability of the international financial system. 
While the issuing banks, the governments and the banks that are little affected are still clever to support the system, meanwhile it can leave of the paying-off of pensions inside term. 
Or it will happen something, what doesn't take a risk to imagine nobody - the financial crisis will overcome in next 15 months. 
But when seeing the crossed news on the partial estatización, now the security that is already in its limit became a justified hope. 
That will be a reason, because the creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking the head about the decision on their isolation of enthusiasm. 
The short term investors can still put the final point and to use the transport to new bill of the losses for next payments of taxes of compensation of benefits about the change in the future. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box 
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 year-old girl, had to be presented in the Highschool of Tachibana the girls they began to laugh: The German is totally " kawaii "! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana knows the word of Sleeves - in a report on the exchanges her the Japan counts. 
"The first day in a school in Japan. 
I felt nervous. 
Already before going to the school he/she was afraid. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the address Kawasaki and I leave in train 40 minutes to the Highschool Tachibana. 
Alone he/she had to find the road, for luck I didn't get lost. 
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my house, in Low Sajonia. 
Of eight in the morning the students come, at twenty to nine a small meeting begins with the professors, the ' home room'. 
Before the class began, he/she had played me to present me. 
I am not also mainly person that speaks with a lot of pleasure in the public, before a class of 40 students. 
As them they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of the mother of my family hostess and also a blouse, blue socks and black shoes of skin. 
Well, this way dressed I put on to the pulpit and I attempted to pronounce everything in correct way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in one week it will be my birthday. 
At this time I was very happy because already for two years he/she had begun to study this language. 
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and made signs and the whole time have listened the word " kawaii " 
He/she already knew it of my Sleeves. 
That belongs to the vocabulary of Japanese girls' survival and it means monkey, pretty" 
Then I slipped quickly in my place. 
The girl to the side had a big smile, for her a honor that the exchange girl had to sit down beside her was. 
The rest of the class was quite calm, but when it sounded the gong, I really felt assaulted. 
All spoke at the same time, they laughed and they asked many questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
Then in the recess all their Bentos took out. 
The mother of my family hostess also made a Lanchbox for my - you/he/she is something another that boring German pieces of bread. 
He/she had rice with grasses, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something as mass meat of tofu. 
In majority of the cases I don't have neither he/she devises of what I eat here in Japan. 
The things are strange and they have a new flavor. 
What is safe is that everything is very rich. 
Well, maybe except for plums marinated in the you leave, bufff! 
In the Japanese schools the bentos is not simply a lunch. 
It sometimes passes that a girl prepares a bento made in very artistic way for a boy and she gives it to him in hope of being able to know it better during a recess. 
On that I read in my Sleeve-Comics. 
I have a lot of curiosity to see if I can also see here it. 
" Why in fact Japan"?, have my friends wondered when I told them that he/she wanted to go to Tokyo to attend one year the school. 
Then always he/she responded: 
"Good, because I fascinate. " 
Finally for years I prefer to read Sleeves. 
To be able to understand the comics and the culture better, one day I began to study some Japanese. 
For me it was absolutely for sure one day I will travel there. 
Also because I have a thin one for tradition and customs. 
Here they have a great value. 
Of a part the Japan is a country of the last technologies and of tendencies, of another part it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country. 
As everything it is very organized, I was not still lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city that I have seen at some time in my life." 
The rats also have feelings 
Is it said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger escapes, why is there also fear? 
Joseph Him Doux, the scientist in the environment of the neurology is convinced that many animals they also have feelings. 
How can you control if them, behaving in the way similar to us, do they feel the same thing? 
In a magazine of called internet " Edge " from many years the contributions are published of scientific famous. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the elected answers to the What a question you think what truth it is without being able to prove it? 
I believe that the animals have sensations and other states of conscience without me or somebody other it could prove it up to now, although we cannot even prove that other people have conscience. 
But in this case at least we can wait for it because the whole human brains present the same fundamental configuration. 
But as soon as we are devoted to other species and let us include the questions on the sensation and in general about the conscience, we enter in the unknown environment because the hardware doesn't coincide. 
When a rat is in the danger, she makes the same thing as the other animals: the dead is made, he/she escapes or it attacks. 
People behave in similar way, of what some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience. 
Naturally I don't believe it. 
Two aspects of the cerebral structure make difficult to contaminate our subjective experience to that of the animals. 
First, they almost always include the associate circuits for the human conscience of the lobe lateral prefrontal of the cerebral bark (because of their participation in the short memory and in the executive functions that direct behavior). 
This wide part is much more developed in the case of people that that of the other primates and it seems that it lacks absolutely in other creatures. 
Keeping at least in mind the aspects referred to our conscience that it depends on the lobe prefrontal of the cerebral bark, among them knowledge on who we are and the ability to drift and to decide, is a reason to suppose that the man even differs of the other primates. 
Another particularity is in the man's linguistic nature: As most of their experience it is together with the language, often that means that the conscience depends on her. 
In this case you can exclude the animals. 
But even when the conscience would not depend on the language, it would influence it so the conscience of the animals, created anyway, in many cases would differ of most of our states of conscience. 
For that reason it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works. 
If that, as something interesting and subjective, neither it is allowed to measure because he/she has the special hardware, neither it is allowed to analyze by means of our experiences, their investigation presents this way us big problems. 
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the experience it consents, but at the same time there is also another aspect of the conscience that would have to be easier for the investigations scientists. 
One could investigate the processes of conscience of the animals without keeping in mind their contents, and that is what passes by heart during the studies short of primates, mainly in the example of the visualization. 
But with this focus that Christof followed Koch and Francis Crick the essential thing it passes rather to the neuter correlatos of the conscience that to the causal mechanisms: Both can be similar or not. 
Surprisingly this focus puts of relief the importance of the lobe prefrontal of the cerebral bark for the formation of the visualization. 
And what is it of that for the sensations? 
I owe to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens to the fear. 
What we describe as fear is consequently a mental state in that we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences like for example the reactions of the body). 
Seen of this point of view the sensations they are very fixed to part of the cerebral bark what distinguishes primates and mainly to the man. 
Of point of view of the linguistic nature they follow classifications of the sensation you die because we can differ and to classify the states with the help of the words and of the grammar to be able to describe the states of others to even of ourselves. 
For example Antonio Damask, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived of the simple activities of the parts of the responsible cerebral bark for the corporal feelings and of the encéfalo trunk, the same thing thinks Jaak Pankseep, but he concentrates more on the trunk encéfalo. 
As this net it has not changed a lot during the human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations. 
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I not consider it probable. 
Pakseep argues that that that rats and men feel as fear, possibly that also sits down this way in two cases: But how can you control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feels the same thing? 
Does seeing the danger a cockroach escape, because because he/she is afraid? 
I am of opinion that the likeness of the behavior doesn't still prove the likeness of experience. 
That is certain that the comparison neuronal helps: rats and men have trunks of similar encéfalo, the cockroaches on the contrary don't have a brain at least. 
Is the trunk of the encéfalo the one that is responsible for sensations? 
Even when it is possible to prove it for the men: How can you prove it in the event of rats? 
Do I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also the cockroaches (who does know it?), do they have sensations. 
But I don't know it how it can prove it. 
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats that emotional sensations because their sensations supposedly are distinguished fundamentally of us (because the human conscience refers to special circuits and the language). 
In any event here the progresses are expected in the neurology environment as long as the same of rats is measured and of men. 
As I don't investigate the language and the conscience of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know it if they exist. 
One can say that I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to advance that to work permanent without results. 
Because well, I am practical emocionalista. 
The president of the UEFA Platini: term of grace for the Poland and the Ucraina 
Iwan Wasjunik, the substitute first minister said that the preparations soon would carry out under the president's direct responsibility and of the first minister. 
"The government looks at the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux like the test of trust of the capacity of the Ukraine to organize the championship of Europe together with the Poland", Wasjunik said. 
"But that is not an amnesty for our country. 
Now the work is about to begin and in the two countries there is much to make." 
The schedule of the construction and the reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the countries hosts are lame. 
The number of the stadiums will possibly be reduced of eight at six. 
"We cannot lose more time. 
Now we have to carry out works with great speed", the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis said. 
"The UEFA won't remove the eyes of us." 
In Poland a more radical step was agreed. 
After numerous scandals the Olympic Committee of Poland suspended the administration of the Polish association PZPN and it replaced for the independent administrating Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission met at the request of the sport minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules", Drzewiecki told to the agency of Polish news PAP. 
"In a letter we have assured the president of the UEFA Platini that the preparation to the championship of Europe 2012 won't suffer of that." 
Alone in the last season many clubs of the first division was condemned because of manipulation in descent to the inferior category, the division advice finally also had to be postponed. 
Counterattack of Dennis indignant Quaid 
She wanted to promote a new movie, he/she talked in an interview about the private life - and he/she has problems with their former-husband: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan designated its former-husband like an adulterer. 
He/she gets angry and it counterattacks. 
The late war of the two roses in the former-couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two actors of Hollywood show an unpleasant fight openly among them. 
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan was pronounced for the first time on the reasons of the marriage failure: "Dennis went a lot of unfaithful time to me, and that was very painful." 
She knew the size of their alone infidelity after divorce. 
The reason of the revelation of the private things was the work of Ryan with the press for its new movie The Women" - a history of the failure of a marriage is counted. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to the appointment of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is unheard that Meg how many times bill the history of our relationship in another version", the 54 year-old man told New York Daily News." 
Among other things it is very lamentable that Jack, their 16 year-old son, again he/she will remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a boy." 
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is again married and it has been potato of twins for time. 
And it puts an end this way to their declarations putting of relief: "It is like be my life it continues. 
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is well." 
The prices of the airplane notes and of hotels they are lowering 
In the first half of the year 2008 the airplane notes and the pernoctaciones in Europe were cheaper comparing those of the last year. 
According to a current study, the airplane notes in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent. 
The airplane notes and the pernoctaciones in hotels became again cheap - this is been of a study of the supplier of the trip services and of the financial services of American Express. 
The company has analyzed its data of reservation of the first half of the year 2008 and after the increase of the prices in the first trimester discovered a big change in the second semester. 
After during many years the prices in the market of hotels continued increasing, the pernoctaciones in many places became cheap. 
In comparison with the last year, between January and March the prices in 41 of the 48 cities different from Europe increased for half term at 6,9 for hundred. 
Of April until June the prices went down already to 3,6 percent comparing the last year. 
The tendencies were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where the travelers had to pay less than the previous year. 
According to American Express, the reason of that was the course of weakened dollar, what was the cause that the interests of the American tourists in traveling diminished." 
The decrease of the prices of the hotels is also made notice much more in the financial centers as Francfort or London that in the points of industrial concentration as Hannóver, Colony or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels increased to 26,3 percent and they break this way a record in Europe. 
In the first trimester the prices of airplane notes also showed the tendencies to the rise: 
Because of the increase of the prices of kerosene the travelers of the class Economy had to pay for term half 7,1 percent more than in the year 2007, the flights of long distance became even more expensive until 29,2 percent. 
Of April until June the prices of the airplane notes in the class Economy, in comparison with the previous trimester, went down for half term to 12,5 percent, but the changes of the prices for the Businessclass and the Firstclass they were small. 
In Germany the change of the prices was more remarkable than in other European countries: 
Of January until February the prices increased at 11,9, in the second semester they went down to 23,6 percent. 
According to a study, the prices for the national flights in Germany even reduced in half. 
The cause of the change of the prices is of a part the increase of the slack economy, he/she explains the company. 
In many parts of the market of the trips with the airplane the demand is lowering. 
Of another part there is big competition for the treaty of Open-Skies that liberalizes the traffic of airplanes between the U.S and the Europe. 
The sign of the tense situation is the annulment of flights of non lucrative distances in air companies, as well as a great number of air companies that in the first half of the year 2008 declared in crash - alone in Europe they were 24 air companies. 
The HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0 
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburgo becomes the leader. 
Luhukay of Borussia to him doesn't still come out to make the goal decimoprimero. 
Kristoffer Klein presented the mandatory landing of the player of the national selection very well Marko Martin. 
The player of Gladbach began to play late and it failed making a goal. 
All that meant reacting to that happened exactly, could read it clearly of their lips. 
Alone he/she knew that he/she was right. 
"We need a second goal", Hermann whistled Rieger in the entrance of booth of the stadium of Hamburgo. 
I don't pass anything special in the catacombs, the time of rest ended up and most of the present were again in its places. 
Rieger was almost during three decades fisioterapeuta of the HSV, he/she enjoys very big reputation like one of those that were a part of the group. 
For that reason their petition was noticed of a responsible person. 
Cornelius Jol the assisting trainer agreed with the head and he lifted the fingers in consent sign. 
Cornelius is brother of Martin Jol, the main trainer of Hamburgo. 
Their order was the same one: Go, the second goal! 
But that was not carried out. 
"Today not everything was pleasant of seeing", he/she added Marcell later Jansen. 
Also Bastian Reinhard had wanted to have it more relaxed." 
The result 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgo has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the team of very weak Gladbach could not show all its force to the weak team of Hamburgo. 
"That was a dirty victory", he/she said summarizing Martin Jol. 
This Monday the SV of Hamburgo will turn its 121 years. 
On Saturday of he/she will be the spectators they had already celebrated their same ones, the blue sky about the stadium and the chart change in the video screen. 
It will be a birthday without a true party. 
"We taste to interpret it", Marcell Jansen said. 
Prevé that the partial qualifications of the chart correspond more to the caprice of the league than to the dominancia of their HSV. 
The quipo with their players forced late as the Brazilian Nev and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen that was removed of FC Bayern needs time to join, but the quipo cannot still shine with its successes. 
"We need more than the feeling and of the dribbling", Jol demands.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of the space probes 
For many years a phenomenon mysteries cause the bewilderment to the investigators: the Dark Matter influences the speed of the space probes during this way called attendance gravitacional to the maneuver. 
The experts fear that the Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein cannot be so correct. 
The space probe " Ulysses " almost spent 18 years flying in the universe. 
Because of that the pipes of fuel are freezing now he/she threatens him a death in the cold. 
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the attendance gravitacional to the maneuver, causes the bewilderment among the investigators. 
The attendance gravitacional is a maneuver of the trajectory of the space probes during that they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the field gravitacional of a planet, for example of the Earth. 
That allows the space probes to save fuel. 
Cassini-Huygens, the probe space European-American used this physical trick as well as he/she made it the probe of the Sun Ulysses. 
But that that surprise to the investigators during many years: The missiles don't behave for 100 percent as well as he/she waits him for it according to the venerable law of the gravitation. 
Rather they frequent irregularities of the speed. 
Unexpectedly the probes have bigger or smaller speed. 
The physiques could not explain this effect up to now. 
They called it the anomaly during the attendance gravitacional to the maneuver. 
Some experts fear that possibly included the general Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein that describes the force of attraction of the matter for the bend of the space cannot be so correct. 
Stephen Adler, the American physique of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes solemnly now as before Einstein didn't confuse and he/she attempts to explain the anomaly during the attendance gravitacional with the help of this way called Dark Matter, in what you/they were the astronomers in the universe. 
"The reason of the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very near to the Earth", he writes. 
The investigators of the universe know the existence of the alone Dark Matter from ten years. 
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and their influence one can be observed in other planets. 
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is totally invisible what means that he/she doesn't send and it doesn't reflect any electromagnetic radiation, mainly also any visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists the Dark Matter makes at least a recruit of the total mass of the universe. 
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
As the minister of external matters of Italy it confirmed, after ten days to pass in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be liberated. 
The kidnappers from the Sudan had demanded millions of the rescue. 
Six kidnappers should be killed in a shooting during the liberation. 
Five Germans are kidnapped in the south of Egypt. 
The negotiations regarding the rescue already began. 
The Germans always fall again in the point of the kidnappers' attention. 
The periodic WELT ONLINE narrates on the most important cases. 
For that seen the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara they are liberated. 
On that the same information presents the state Egyptian television, the radio station of Arab television Al-Arabija and the Italian media. 
After the news on the liberation in the Italian radio station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian minister of external matters, confirmed the liberation: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are liberated. 
' Now we control their state of health", Frattini said. 
Five Germans, five Italians and a Rumanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and they are in the security, he/she informs the state Egyptian television. 
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are in the one in route to Cairo. 
What is incomprehensible is the reasons of a shooting before the liberation of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian guard of security the kidnappers were clever to put an end to the kidnapping, but the army of the Sudan suddenly had killed six kidnappers. 
"The problem was solved. 
They agreed with the rescue", the guard said. 
It was alone of receiving the hostages when suddenly this surprise arrived." 
On Sunday the soldiers sudaneses six kidnappers have killed and at two of them they have stopped in the border area among the Sudan, the Chad and the Egypt. 
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the rescue in the amount of six million Eurus; the money had to give the German wife of an of the hostages. 
The newspaper The Masri The Jom", referring to a German mediator, he/she informed that the liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of its security. 
According to the report the kidnappers have the intention of liberating the feminine hostages after having received the rescue. 
The men had to be detainees until the kidnappers had a sure route to escape. 
The embassy of Germany in Cairo rejected to take the position regarding this report. 
Stepfather's abuse took to the suicide" 
According to the tribunal, years of abuse for their stepfather they took a woman to kill itself. 
Michael Trerise, 57 years, of Stithians in Cornwall, it has been condemned to five years of jail after it admitted eight positions of indecent assaults. 
The Real Tribunal of Truro, through a study indagatorio, knew that he regularly had tied its daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl had among five seven years. 
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for their death." 
The tribunal knew that the Sra Randle committed suicide in its house of Mutley in Plymouth, April 1 the 2007, to the 34 year-old age. 
In the season in that the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise accustomed to tie it and to blindfold him the eyes before carrying out its sexual acts, while its mother was working in a pub. 
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall. 
Their stepchild moved to Plymouth. 
However, the tribunal knew that the Sra Randle that used great part of its time working as voluntary for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted twice per week. 
In 2006, the fiscal Ramsey Quaife referred to the court that that some friends of the Sra Rande had said of her that after having been a great surfista and cyclist, now it seemed emotionally dead", as if it had given up the life." 
In April 2007 their true father, Terrace Randle, found the woman died in its apartment of Plymouth. 
It is supposed that the Sra Rande has killed itself being suffocated by means of a bag of plastic. 
The Sr Randle faced its daughter's stepfather that wrote a confession letter that you concludes saying: "I used to tie her and ventarle the eyes. 
It was never a sexual assault. 
I feel responsible for their death." 
The judge Christopher Elwen answered to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for their victim it should have been an awful experience, especially when he/she was only seven years old. 
This unpleasant saga finishes with the victim taking off its own life. 
Even clearer, it is that if she had not made it, the question would not probably have finished in the tribunals." 
And he/she added: "I have noticed the effect that there was on their daughter along the years according to the description made by the father and the mother of Stephanie the abuse. 
Clearly she had been able to have a promising future, of success and happy." 
An official loaded by the loss of data 
The BBC was informed that an official of the Cabinet that forgot some secret documents in the train in June will be accused by virtue of the Law on the official secrets. 
The man, in work trip for the Ministry of Defense, abandoned two documents highly classified in the train for Waterloo. 
The documents were passed the BBC before being given to the police. 
It is surely the less serious position by virtue of the law and it doesn't suppose some indication of the intention of offending. 
The correspondent of the BBC for the Defense Frank Gardner referred that the condemnation had arrived as a surprise for many in the English administration. 
"They thought that is an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet, he/she said. 
The employee that cannot be named, is loaded under the section 8.1 of the Law, the clause that refers to the safeguard of the information. 
The Service Real Juríco pointed out that the official should be accused by the Metropolitan Police, by reason of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Committee of Secret Services. 
The forgotten documents contained secret informations on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the forces of security in Iraq. 
The official was informed of the decision on Monday in the morning and soon after transferred from his house to a secret place. 
The construction societies face the price of B&B 
In Great Britain the construction societies could face a price of more than 80 thousand sterling pounds after the rescate/salvamento of the bank Bradford and Bingley. 
The Government, indeed, provided 14 trillion sterling pounds to protect the deposits of the 2,6 millions of thrifty of the bank. 
The interest on the loan will be paid by all the companies that use the money of the the savers, included the 59 construction societies. 
The general director of the Association of the Societies of Construction (BSA), Adrián Coles, it considers humiliating that the societies and their members have to pay 
Possibly, the loan de14 trillions should be reimbursed after the mortgages of Bradford and Bingley are redeemed. 
However, the interests that are become in the ínterin, are supposed loaded every year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits. 
The Plan of Compensation of the Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction societies are included in that number. 
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with wisdom... be called to pay today the price of the institutions that you/they have been much less wise. 
Adrián Coles, BSA 
That is to say that each one of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation societies had to pay 18% of the cost approximately. 
The Treasure estimates that the interest on the loan will ascend to 450 thousand sterling pounds in 2009. 
This behaves that the societies will have to recover 81 thousand sterling pounds to face the first year of interest. 
Adrián Coles, general director of the Commercial Association of the Societies of Construction, declared to the BBC that this situation is unjust. 
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with wisdom in the growth of the real state market are called to pay the price taken place by those that were much less wise." 
According to the BSA, there are not data that indicate the failure of some society from 1945. 
  will Have the necessity to examine all the aspects of this matter in next weeks to discover what options they exist to protect the construction societies and to its members in in front of what could be an excellent price, Mr. Cole added. 
The interest yielded in 2009 covers seven months starting from the end of September of this year until that of March. 
In 2010, it will be a complete year of exigible interests that you/they will be able to be almost twice more. 
Being the societies of construction mutual organizations and there not being shareholders, their members will finish paying the price inevitably, be to inclination adults rates or lower interests in their savings.

Denied the freedom low deposit to the former First Minister from Bangladesh 
A tribunal of Bangladesh has rejected the application of freedom low deposit for the former First Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be driven to the jail when he/she returned to its country. 
Their defenders said that the tribunal didn't grant him the freedom low deposit accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729.700) to a manager when he/she was First Minister.

"The Supreme Tribunal rejected the petition of freedom low deposit for Sheikh Hasina sustaining that he/she could not obtain the freedom low deposit reason it was already abroad in treatment under conditional freedom, its lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said. 
"We will interpose an appeal resource against the order of the Supreme Tribunal." 
Their defenders argued that she needed the freedom low deposit to return to their country from the foreigner and to get ready for the elections of December. 
Sheikh Hasina should return to its homeland after October 17, according to what referred a leader of the League Awami last Sunday.

New investigation in the assumption of the American lawyers 
The attorney general from the United States has named a special procurator to investigate the discharge of nine American lawyers in 2006. 
The reason was a report in that the general inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the performance on the part of the officials of the administration. 
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former General Produrador Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed by political reasons. 
The Special Procurator Nora Dannehy is investigating if the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in the intent of blocking the justice. 
"Serious accusations of possible criminal behaviors have not been investigated fully or resolved, the attorney general Beautiful Glenn affirms in the report. 
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special procurator with the power to force the witness to leave their declarations. 
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were removed of their positions by the Department of Justice in December of 2006. 
In that moment, the department motivated the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been fired by low yield. 
But later it was known that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other their colleagues, and many observers took to the conclusion that you say goodbye to them they would be motivated by political reasons. 
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, members of high profile of the Congress, while other they had refused to investigate the accusations of electoral fraud against the Democrats. 
These lawyers investigate and they prosecute the judicial cases for the government 
and they can be discharged in any moment, but not removed by political reasons. 
The successive boss of the Department of Justice, the attorney general Alberto Gonzales, low pressure for the discharges, gave up its position. 
A certain number of other officials of the Department of Justice made the same thing. 
The attorney general report is very critical of the paper played by the Sr Gonzales in the matter, and he/she underlines as him he/she had a primary responsibility for the discharges that he/she abdicated of its liderato position and it was colaborativo notably not in the process. 
Other officials, and among them Karl Rove, the former collaborator of Bush, they were criticized by not having cooperated with the investigation. 
The epic poetry of Meat Loaf of a lot of honor 
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored in the Q Awards for its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer that will pick up the special prize next week in the ceremony that will take place in London, said that to obtain this recognition will be a honor." 
The song that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977. 
The group of Coldplay is taking the candidacies for the prizes of this year and making the classification of the four categories. 
Paul Rees, editor-boss of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that time and gender, and Bat transcend Out Of Hell it belongs certainly one to them. " 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity as which was used by Meat Loaf. 
An instrumental section of almost two minutes he/she opens the hymn. 
The song was known first as an it sails in the United Kingdom in 1979 and it ended up being number 15 in the classification. 
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained about nine years in the classifications and he/she ended up selling in the entire world more than 40 million copies. 
Meat Loaf - real Marvin names Lee Aday - it has suffered problems of health in the last years, including a surgical operation for its heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, a sharp laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts. 
Later on it arose that he/she had a cyst in their vocal chord. 
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps prompt for sale 
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, other simply of service. 
However, to many people, included the veteran taxi drivers and the local residents of long date, they find difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, mainly because many of them have never heard speak of this street. 
Is the small street in the East Village and does he/she extend to the North of the Primiera he/she Remains silent? before I found the Seconda he/she Remains silent - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue. 
This callecita, more or less of 30 feet wide and 120 of long, he/she resembles each other to a powdery alley more than an active road. 
There are not signs. 
It is practically impossible of finding in an atlas. 
The street, however, has admirers. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently has built deluxe buildings in the Primiera he/she Remains silent 
that he/she wants Extra repavimentar Place and to create a clean corridor to the stores and boutiques that it is hoped to open up in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include the neighbors of old it dates that they commented to be loved by the rail simply truncated because it is before one of the last remains of the past of the block the appropriation of the buildings. 
However, the Department of the Housing, Preservation and Development of the city that he/she has the control of the street, don't have any interest in possessing it. 
In the meeting of the Committee of Community of Vencidad for the use of the earth that took place this month, the representatives of the agency Avalon sketched a proposal to buy the street. 
However, the committee, preferring that the street remained to the city, he/she requested a new plan that next month will be presented, like Susan Stetzer said, the manager of district of the Community n.3. 
"The city is landlady today of very few spaces and we would like that it continued possessing Extra Place, he/she said the Mrs. 
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and to negotiate the space, but we also want to guarantee the public access to the street." 
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago he/she wanted to repair the small street and to install some seats, included some to be used as coffee, awaiting renting the spaces. 
The idea that Avalon could buy the street arose for the first time during the meeting of this month 
but Michele of Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he/she not necessarily wanted to possess it. 
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of transforming it into a public area, he/she said, adding that the sale proposal came from the same city. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Committee for the Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire of the city that of selling the street and he observed that the mission of the agency is the development of the property more than the administration of that. 
In comparison with their surroundings more than color, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a print in the history. 
Some believe that he/she obtained their name in 1802, when the great property of property of Philip Minthorne was divided between its children and this narrow earth fringe it was not claimed by anybody. 
The back door of the CBGB, the monument of punk rock that closed in 2006, you abriba in Extra Place, but the street is maybe better acquaintance for the picture of the establishment that comes out in the covered with the album of Ramones Rocket to Russia." 
"The environment was magnificent, Danny commented Fields, the manager of the Ramones that took out the picture in November of 1976. 
"It was full with garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, strings." 
Some residents, included the bloggers that write on the aburguesamiento of the East Village, has been opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the public, even modest goods that are, should continue being public. 
Others have eulogized Extra Place like strange piece, practically without changes, a crack of the city that should be guided. 
Jeremías Moss that directs a called blog Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, The Book of Lamentations: To Bitterly Nostalgic Look at to City in the Process of Going Extinct"), it has put to disposition it leaves of a chat of the history of the city on Extra Place, published by the daily New The Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little an alley strait and without exit, dark also for the day and marked by doors of warehouse of rusty iron and against-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters." 
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same one in a recent afternoon. 
A rat you curía through the part behind of the street and he/she stopped the door that was used to enter to the CBGB close and that now it welcomes a deluxe clothing store. 
Graffiti in the walls and a bottle of empty beer closely 22-oz were near a new lot of waste newspapers. 
Some pasantes said that they rarely put attention in Extra Place, but they suggested that one could give him one cleaned. 
The Sr Fields, on the other hand, noticed that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state. 
"The best years in my life I happened, he/she said, in dark, humid and disgusting places." 
The debate on the bilingualism: immersion in the English language 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and T. Throw Izumi the positions of the candidates they discuss on the bilingual education. 
T. throw Izumi, an old associate in studies on the California and director of studies of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book Not ace Good ace You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice." 
To call from an effective way to the Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals as regards education made by Barack Obama are the example of that. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama takes he/she notices that the Afro-Americans and the Latin students have significantly less probabilities of graduating that the white students, and this it is a very certain consideration. 
To combat such differences in the events of the learning, the plan of education of Obama specifically pleads, among other things, the bilingual education of transition for the student-English. 
However, the open question for the Sr Obama is if the commitment of the bilingual education that prefers in classroom the instruction in languages different from English, be effective in annulling the distance in the final results. 
Let us take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially grateful primary school in the oriental region of the county of Los Angeles. 
In this school the immense majority of the students is Hispanic and of family with rent lowers: 
more than a third of the students, many of those which recently arrived, they are learning the English language. 
However, an incredible 100 percent of the the fourth year-old students, it has been evaluated positively in the exam of mathematics of 2008 
and almost an equally astonishing 93 percent has dominated the test of English language and arts. 
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that the favorido for Mr. Obama. 
The school Sixth Street emphasizes the revision and the practice, the constant evaluation of the competitions and it doesn't tolerate some attitude of excuses. 
Also, and here it is where the Sr Obama should take note, in accordance with Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixth Street, the focus of the school for English's instruction to the students is in the total immersion." 
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction. 
The Sra Mikels that is opposed to the bilingual education, told me, we have been successful extraordinary with students like this last that has arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter later in the classroom 12 months you would not be able to pick up what was." 
"It works, it pointed out, we believe that it works." 
Will the Sr take Obama a school like Sixth Street Prep like a model of replying for other schools with Hispanic-English big populations of students? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the the politicians of their party on the matter of the education (the Associations for the National Education have been for long time defenders of the bilingual education) and their same constant support to the dark bilingual education the prediction of the answer of the Sr Obama. 
Although it is that the immigrants should learn English, recently the Sr Obama has trivializado the question letting that people should stop to worry about the legislation that is only written in English 
and instead of that, he/she said, you should make sure that their boy can speak Spanish." 
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and to close lagoons, it should consider the education models that work well, carefully more than to reject them or trivializarlos. 
The price of the petroleum falls abruptly after the renovated economic fears 
The price of the petroleum decreased drastically this Monday because of the concern that the American plan of rescue for the financial markets cannot be able to reactivate the economy.

As the economic situation he/she deteriorates, it is expected in an it reduces of the basic, included demand of products the petroleum. 
"The perspectives for the world justness, the interest rate and of change they will be more and more uncertain, the analysts of the Deutsche wrote Bank in a note to the investors. 
"We believe that the basic products won't be able to escape from this infection. 
From the perspective of the products, ours more pressing concern is the evaluation if the American virus will spread at world level and specifically to China. "

Second room of madness: I equip it establishes record 
After having happened, during the last eight seasons, more time than nobody in the uniform of Jets, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought that he/she had seen everything. 
Then he saw like the things are developed in the second fourth this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a party without annotation in a game of being deflated. 
"I have never seen anything as that, Ellis commented. 
The second room began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals they had played with laziness under the somber of the clouds. 
At this time it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles carrying out a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect premonition for one afternoon in that the relationship evolution among the players had a great jump forward. 
Favre found Coles more for two goals in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the half. 
"I didn't leave my road, Favre of all the steps that went to Coles said. 
"He is a devil of a player. 
Our communication has been big, independently of what people can think." 
While Favre and Coles were carried out in the prey, the defense of the Cardinals mistreated to the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted an errant shot and it returned it 32 yards for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith puntó to another pass and it intercepted it. 
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to the lack by Warner. 
In the last turnover, the lacks forced by Bowens, they could have been the best. 
The Cardenals had taken the possession with 10 available seconds, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely him dió a kick of 20 yards to win a definitive one 34-0. 
They are the biggest points that the Jets never made in a room. 
To The trainer of the team, Eric Mangini, ask him of describing the madness of this moment, he/she said: "The second room or the third room? " 
When he/she was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked much more the second room that the terzero. 
They have won a heap of points in a very short period of time." 
Rested Gebrselassie heads its world record 
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider him the biggest corridor in the history, overcoming its own world record in the marathon of Berlin this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the career of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in the acomodadiza career in plain in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds its obtained previous record of 2:04:26, the last year in Berlin. 
To the 35 year-old age, Gebrselassie has established the record world number 26 in a career of an impressive longitude so it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the career contrarreloj until to the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not participated to the olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - maybe in a too alarming way, in retrospective - that the contamination of the air increased its problems with the asthma. 
On the other hand, you pointed to run in Berlin. 
Under practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees when beginning the career, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie this Domingo won, using in half term some sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds for mile. 
From when hint corridors like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya has become at long distances, the record of the marathon has decreased in more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo gives Costa of Brazil it won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998. 
After the victory of last Sunday, Gebrselassie said to the journalists that it had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks before and that it had lost a week of training. 
It is evident that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty. 
"I am very happy, Gebrselassie said to the journalists. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I began one week ago another time, and today I tinted some doubts, but at the end everything was well." 
The athlete has been object of some critics - especially in Kenya, the African-American-oriental rival from Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much her careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, being based on the marcapasos as if I/you/he/she was a career hint, and putting the record for before the competition sense. 
But this critic doesn't diminish the greatness of the abilities of Gebrselassie like corridor. 
This Sunday, to the march of four kenianos, Gebrselassie reached half of the career in 1:02:04. 
Two corridors of elite of Kenya, James Kwambai and Talk Kamathi, they began to challenge Gebrselassie after their marcapasos diminished. 
But little before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie caught a last impulse to separate Kwambai who concluded second in 2:05:36, improving its best personal record for almost five minutes. 
Kamathi arrived to the third place in 2:07:48. 
In the feminine career, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazajstán but now German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh quicker time in the history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain possesses the world record of 2:15:25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and it won the Marathon of London in 2:24:14. 
She neither participated in the Games of Beijing for what was described as a lesion in the back, but he/she recovered to win in Berlin and to establish their personnel better record in almost five minutes in the third marathon that he/she ran. 
He/she made a career of intelligent calculation, allowing a quartet of corridors kenianos and Ethiopians to make of head and, next, recovering them after 18 ½ miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second square in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya concluded of third in 2:25:01. 
In a city separated, the pride and the tests of the color life 
Hidden by the expansion from the park to topic of the big Orlando, to few kilometers of the brilliant, noisy and colossal city, he/she is a calm town, where the pride and the complications of the Afro-American experience are very evident. 
Eatonville, the first totally inhabited city for black incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as her it described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 color men, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and neither a jail." 
Now it is a pilgrimage place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee has come to the annual Zora! It trades in Eatonville to pay homage to the Sra Hurston, the most famous writer in the Rebirth of Harlem. 
And, however, in many senses, the city that she described? also making it a tourist stage by means of their inclusion in the guide of trips of Florida taken place by the Project of the Federal Writers of the season of the depression - it continues being separated a place. 
The city is independent, worthy and private as it was it in the years ?30, when Sra Hurston wrote that the black ones rural in the Florida often resistiva to share its true ideas with the white man that knows so little on us and that he/she doesn't know what goes getting lost." 
Even now, in the year in that a black presidential candidate, the senator Barack Obama, he/she has gotten the attention to begin an I dialogue on the matter of the race, many continue being cautious in in front of the outsider. 
"We are very cautious about the way in that our history is counted, Orchard Jones, 59 years, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city said. 
"He/she has to be correct." 
Eatonville always has been defined a victory paradox and it fights. 
It is to the same tempo a historical model of the statement of the black ones and a community of almost 2.400 people that live under a level of double poverty of the national stocking. 
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes scorned, others eulogized - that was born of the slavery in America. 
It is not of missing, if those that reside here are at the same time proud and reserved. 
To AND the concern for the image of Eatonville really began with Zora, I eat here nobody he/she calls him Sra Hurston. 
She introduced their native city to the world through their deep books in dialect like Mules and Men" (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide of the Florida transformed the city, hardly outside of the Route 17, a highway that he/she often runs through the center of the Florida forgotten toward inside the history of the black ones and the human drama. 
Having cement face so much in the life as much as in the literature, the Sra Hurston took to its readers to the store of the first mayor's of Eatonville property, Joe Clarke, and later inside more private areas. 
"Outside of the highway left, wrote by hand, there is the modern school public marón with its white finishes, its well maintained jardinos and game patios, taken care by Howard Miller, as him he/she can hardly read and to write." 
She also mentions the widow's new husband Dash and he/she writes that Glenn Lee sells drinks of all type and anyone thing leaves with transitory rooms." 
Therefore, in only some hundred of words, the Sra Hurston puts in relationship Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with the illiteracy, the second marriage and the sex. 
Evidently, this Fodor didn't make it. 
In fact, not everybody appreciated the portrait. 
"Zora described it such which was, Her Dinkins said, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that the Sra Hurston immortalized mentioning men that went singing songs without color Preposition its beauty. 
He/she added: "They didn't like some people that." 
The Sra Hurston is even remembered here like a vivacious eccentric that frequently returned after its family moved to Jacksonville, in Florida. 
Franklin Augusto, 77 years, it is remembered that when the Sra Hurston arrived in city, he/she made it without previous warning in a big Chevrolet, smoking and taking pants in a city that today is still proud of dressing with dignity. 
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically. 
"People were always happy much of seeing Zora, Mr. Franklin continues. 
But, he/she adds, balancing in their seat in a back patio with view on the Lake Sabelia, where the Sra Hurston was probably baptized, she never remained too much time." 
When the Sra Hurston died in 1960, it was poor and its books were no longer in stamping. 
As most of the world, Eatonville seemed also to have been forgotten her. 
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only color woman in the Barnard College in the years ?20, it was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he/she had been living. 
In Eatonville, there were not big ceremonies commemorative, neither big public readings. 
"I don't believe that its contribution to the world or its inheritance was understood, Valerie Boyd said, author of Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of the Sra Hurston published in 2003. 
A certain viraje arrived in the ?80. 
The officials of the County of Orange wanted to put a highway of five rails through the city to substitute the Kennedy Boulevard, the main street of two rails of the labor community. 
The expansion of the area of Orlando had already pushed the Interstate one 4 through the western border of the city. 
The proposal arrived in a moment in that Eatonville was recovering of one period difficult of its history. 
The forced integration, among other things, it had put an end to him relatively idyllic isolation of the comunidad. 
In the ?50, the fight for the racial mixture took the hate Preposition the community. 
"During that season, a group of white boys, they left for the city throwing oranges and each thing against people that were seated to the side, Mr. Franklin said. 
"They also killed a girl, once. 
They threw him against a watermelon of the car." 
In a letter of the 1955 to the Sra Hurston wrote the daily The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration for the Supreme Tribunal that, in Brown v. Board of Education insulted instead of honoring to my race." 
R The residents say today that the desegregation of the schools, positive in some aspects, it had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and tunneled the trust of their youths. 
"Were the black children accustomed to be hugged - do I remember this? he/she got used to hug the professor in the morning and at night, N.Y said. Nathiri, the daughter of Her Dinkins and executive director Preserves the Eatonville Community, an organization without ends of lucre. 
This lasted, he/she added, until the professors and the students didn't come from the same place. 
"He/she didn't go hugging your professor because white éra - there is a cultural breach there, the Sra Nathiri said. 
The civil rights, however, did help to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons? black writers, actors and artists that passed above the prejudices, the same as he/she made it her, with floating, trust and lines like: " How one can some to deny to itself the pleasure of my company! 
I don't understand it." 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker Hurston left until the anonymous tomb of the Sra and it began to fight to resuscitate its reputation. 
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of the Sra Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroduciéndola in the American cánones. 
The project of the highway arrived exactly in the moment in that the most famous daughter in Eatonville went another time under the reflectors. 
And this time, the old neighbors of the Sra Hurston saw it as a savior. 
In 1988, the community began to plan a fair for the Sra Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that highway. 
Admirers' thousands arrived to the event later inaugural two years, and every January, many return for the celebration. 
After several years, the county has abandoned its highway proposal. 
"The resuscitated idea of the highway to five roads, it would have been to put in what you would call bend speed, a true civic pride, the Sra Nathiri he/she said. 
The Sra Boyd more simply said it: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory on the project of the highway has helped to change the image of the same city. 
People of it was city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer that began to come to the church of here in 1993, they began to appear in big numbers, and the residents began to revise the past. 
Eatonville entered in the National Historical Registration in 1998. 
A new library (taking the name of Hurston, of course) he/she opened their doors in 2006, on a repavimentado and beautified Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today in day, Eatonville continues being an anomaly in Florida: to only six miles of the center of Orlando, he/she can, sometimes, to feel eats in a street of the low past a summer rain, in such a small city as the one that was founded for only 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(90 percent of people is black today's day.) 
The outsiders that come in search of the history of Eatonville, of their meaning, often they are still treated with caution. 
To A permission in advance is necessary to make most of the interviews, and some things - as the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and black men that work in the field showing - they cannot be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as the Sra Jones, a brave and convinced teacher that he/she considers weakness for the red one brilliant, he/she still fears that their community island gives it can be misinterpreted. 
And, however, as the Hurston festival it has been enlarged, a bigger level of native pride has also arisen. 
The youths, in particular, spread to see Eatonville to the same way that the Sra Hurston saw all its race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, silly and mixed. 
It is a sincere civic sense what one can listen in the voice of the nephew of the Sr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, that goes planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or for Police's Department that he/she said he/she could need something of help. 
And even those that are younger, as Lark and Alexia Kenon, two twins of 11 years of Winter Park, seems to have learned how to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most of people, in case that you/they dare to go until here, they will have to think, ' Oh, this city is not anything in comparison with any otra', he/she tells Lark Kenon after going to the church in a recent Sunday. 
"But if you really stop and you take a moment to look to their history, it is a very pleasant city." 
Here, in New York, all speak averagely of finances 
In the surface, anything has changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed far from the kiosks and of the gigantic television screens in Times Square, would not realize to be in the eye of the hurricane. 
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the offices to nest of bee that you/they are above their heads, the bankers and the agents of speculative funds that monopolize New York face newspaper with the worst bad day in the office from the bassoon of 1929. 
Boys for the delivery to home continue making resonate their metal shopping carts for the tea through the sidewalks and taking muffins trays for meetings breakfast. 
Latin men continue crawling among buildings of apartments cargodos, the same as human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric stamping colgandas to a yoke through their shoulders. The office workers still wait in line for their food to take of the morning, and it continues being impossible to catch a taxi between the 4 and the 7 in the afternoon in the labor days. 
The employees still wait making line for their bagel to the shopping carts of the the salespersons, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between the four and five in the afternoon in the days of the week. 
I looked like each other as if there was not a crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there is, I have decided to open a new bill of savings. 
Although it had calculated the necessary time so that the operation coincided with the calm of the end of the afternoon in my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a line of more or less 20 people were already waiting. 
And not for before the employee's window, to retire their cash or to make a deposit, but in front of the bank of services to the client, where the lifelong clients order their checkbooks of checks, the tourists look for instructions to go to the department stores of Macy and new clients want to open their bills. 
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my personal banker of trust", and they were in line for the same reason that me. 
Contrary to me, still, they had already retired their savings of the smallest banks in places from where they had commuted them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Island of Staten. 
They had taken out this way their money of those called saving associations (a little like a construction society), of the credit unions and of the boxes of savings of their native city whose brancas only works inside the state of ownership, and that they say to treat the clients like its family. 
During the last year, 15 of of these banks quietly have failed. 
In the last days, Mutual Washington, a bank with $327 thousand millions of active, he/she entered in crash, and as the New Yorkers they went toward their houses on Friday at night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some saving deposits of $440 thousand millions, he/she went looking for a rescue buyer. 
The workers of the offices and stores that stayed before me, fearing another collapse, they were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a sure refuge, what is making most of the rescues in Wall Street. 
Ordinary people from New York have become the last weeks in experts of the finances. 
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, he/she referred to Lehman Brothers, the unsuccessful bank, and their executive director of heart-stricken aspect, Dick Fuld, commented the matter with familiarity as if they complained about the inactivity of a colleague. 
And Lyn, fiftieth and something porter in uniform of my block of apartments, it has changed the normal direction of our conversations it has more than enough Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the tradesman. 
He told me, after my visit to the bank that now have all my savings in funds of the monetary market. 
The commutation is made, I am not taking some risk."

"I capture the teacher outside of scene to extract their character Günther Bauer_Fotógrafo 
Neither heels neither steering wheels neither premiere suits. 
The essence of the flamenco's big teachers, robbed of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the man's relaxed aspect or the woman. 
To a side the artist. 
To the other one, the person. 
Inseparable I save in the intimacy, in those moments unaware to the public, when to find the privacy of an expression, the depth of a stolen look or the expresividad of some hands, unworried because they won't leave to scene. 
The German Günther alternating Bauer in Flamenco-people the teatralidad of some settings in scene with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less well-known side of these teachers. 
With this proposal, the photographer picks up the flamenco's particular iconography from different environments. 
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flamenco Picture, the reflective exhibition the flamenco's international importance, bigger every day", the creator explains who clarifies that Flamenco-people he can be people anyone but, when seeing the pictures, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists in the scenario. 
This people depicted in the street are artists able to transmit in scene passion, sadness, happiness... capturing the public. 
To capture the personality of these artists it is not necessary to take out pictures of the scenario. 
They take their personality and character inside. 
That that to my I was interested it was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the flamenco's personality of the big ones." 
With the flavor of the festival he/she Sings of the Mines", Bauer began in 1.997 a long trip to depict to the flamenco singers, guitarists or bailaores with a badge camera. 
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and of the material they remember the classic picture. 
The application of different stylistic means breaks up with the classic base of the image, conferring him modernity, he/she devises that it reflects how the own Bauer understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that it evolves and it surprises every day." 
It is not the action of the dance, of the one he/she sings or of the touch in yes, but the artist's personality, their character that captures with their art to the public. 
The search of an encounter with the essential thing, with the goblin that becomes visible in a form of feeling, of being and of being they are and they have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery The Fotómata. 
Acquaintances figures of the flamenco as Diego The Norway lobster, Chano Wolf, Cristina Holes, Enrique Lives you, The Lebrijano, Antonio Channels, Vicente Friend, among other, they configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists. 
The project has become the flamenco's anthology that soon will be published in a book that will pick up the portraits exposed in the sample. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer took him to repeat the idea two years ago with veteran sportsmen's Portraits" (" SportARTproject "). 
Although the concepts are different in Flamenco-people, the photographer admits that I love to depict people, to know them and to be able to enter an instant in his life, be a long instant or I cut. 
I believe that inside the picture the portrait is the most difficult gender. 
You are or you face with people, characters that sometimes neither you know, or that they only leave you some minutes to be able to take the picture. 
In spite of these circumstances, as photographer, always intent to make reality my ideas." 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that takes for title Flamenco-people it is exhibited in the Gallery The Fotómata, located in the number 20 of the street of the Bush, parallel to Hercules' Boulevard, where he/she will be able to visit one another until the next one October 16.

' Mayo' blood, the epic bet of Garci 
Being inspired by Benito's National Episodes Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the celebrated rising of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, the one that is the most ambitious movie in its filmography with near 15 million budget Eurus. 
This way, the film director has tried to illustrate the torrent of characters and the social analysis that she has admired always in the well-known novelist's work, she has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría to the front of a wide cast of interpreters. 
Blood of May, with a superior footage at both and a half hours, opens this Friday in the film rooms, to become the future in a miniserie for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration. 
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures to have fulfilled this filming a childhood dream" that should thank Esperanza Aguirre who took charge him three years ago to rotate a commemorative tape for the second centennial of May from Madrid 2 from the Community of Madrid, something that accepted provided the story was based on the National Episodes. 
The 15 million budget that it has contributed in their entirety the Community of Madrid constitute for Garci an unique opportunity to set with the decorations and the appropriate wardrobe the portrait of a heedless Spain that he/she made a mistake of boss for the one that to fight, since, the fight for the independence took to the town to enormous delay with Fernando's reign VII", it has pointed. 
But the film director regrets not to have had a financing like that of Alatriste or Goya's ghosts - more than double that of Blood of May -, for what has not been able to rotate some scenes captured in a script signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with who has collaborated in almost all her career. 
For it, the director of beginning again, it has impacted in the one that is their habitual form of work, the setting in scene with the actors, with those that it usually rehearses before beginning the filming and to those that doesn't make casting, to seem him humiliating and to consider that it leaves of the director's occupation he/she resides in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which works." 
Many of the interpreters with those that it coincides in Blood of May repeat before their camera, like it is the case of Miguel Rellán, of Carlos Larrañaga or of Fernando Guillén Crow. 
Candidate to the Oscar in four occasions - of which it won a -, Garci considers that anyone of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the own Blood of May, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected one, The blind sunflowers, don't represent to a young generation of the Spanish cinema that is the one that should be given to know", it has assured. 
With this movie Garci doesn't wait prizes. 
"In the beginnings you believe that you work for the posterity, then you realize that you only work for the prosperity, and now you conform to with making a movie more", Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.

It was a dancer of free dance and specialist in oriental dances. 
He/she had an exciting life, pioneer of the woman's liberation, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhist and vegetarian and he/she pled for the abolition of the corset that impeded the free feminine movement. 
This woman's life that marked a revolution dancística and aesthetics in the Europe of among wars, Isabel fascinated Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and her this character proposed me and I found incredible." 
According to the bailaora, we don't seek to count their life but picking up their spirit. 
The titles of their dances have suggested me sticks of the flamenco. 
This way, the dance of the butterfly suggested me a peasant, or the dance of the snake some tangos. 
Their dance was sensual and to my they have told me that my dance is also inside this aesthetics", he/she affirms. 
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda that will sing Isabel again in one in their shows, the same as he/she made in that of The open door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral who exceptionally has wanted to collaborate with who was their student. 
"Matilde makes of Turtledove of bigger, the character of the maturity. 
I am happy because it has accepted to act in my work and I feel very honest for it." 
The assembly also has the musical composition and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the one sings of Miguel Ortega, the Flea and Moi of Moron; the percussion of The Bird, as well as the viola of Rafa The Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez that makes the paper of the eternal companion of this type of artists that you/they were godlike in all its extension, and that they always walk in love of them." 
In the work it is also counted mainly in some way this woman's life that was developed in places so distant, for the time, as the India, United States, or Russia, besides for all Europe, since it habitually resided in London. 
"I have wanted to remember it because I think that it belongs to those women that have an enormous influence in a certain time and now nobody knows and much less it puts in value their work", Bayón affirms. 
The show will give beginning today at the 20,30 hours in the theater Lope de Vega. 
The publication of the Newspaper of a poet newlywed also closes the Triennium 
The presentation of the first cultured edition of the Newspaper of a Poet Reciencasado in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), place where Juan Ramón Jiménez got married with Zenobia in March of 1916, it is framed inside the activities programmed by the Consejería of Culture of the Meeting of Andalusia to celebrate the Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorating the fifty anniversary of the concession of the Prize Nobel of Literature and of the death of both.

America is liked less without Paul Newman 
"God sometimes believes perfect people. 
Paul Newman belonged one to them." 
The sentence belongs to the actress Sally Field that worked with him in Absence of malice", and he/she gives the idea of the abandonment of the American cinema, and of all America, before the impactante he/she devises that Newman has left. 
He/she looks that they found difficult to give him an Oscar. 
And that it was retired from 2007. 
And that it was known that it was very sick. 
It has been even this way a mazazo for all. 
"What one feels is sometimes beyond all expression, and I now have lost a great friend", Robert cried Redford, my life and my country they were better thanks to his existence." 
Nobody was afraid of making the ridicule neither of exaggerating. 
A father of the cinema had died and of the homeland in a particularly dark moment, with fear to the terrorists and the markets, with the American self-esteem for the floors, looking for reasons hopelessly for the dignity. 
When so hard it is the time and without virtue the men and good few beings that to admire you has left, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
It embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and really. 
It was enemy formal of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation the drugs created in their dead first-born's honor by overdose until their mark of homemade and organic food to combat. 
An entire gift to a country to which has cost him a lot to overcome to a culture alimentary suicide. 
The shock wave of the admiration swept Hollywood without assisting to nationalities neither passports. 
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, verified that a man has not died but an era. 
Another English, the managing oscarizado Sam Mendes, said that to work with Newman was no more, no less that the summit of its career. 
The arrived bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman its biggest inspiration. 
"He/she has left us the very high list to all", George verified Clooney, maybe one of the few ones that today in day dares to try to live like Paul lived Newman: maintaining high the honesty demand and of having a serious private life and far from the cameras. 
This is not always easy or not even possible in the jungla today mediática. 
But there is who attempts it, and Paul Newman is its example. 
He/she got divorced once but then it was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to which was faithful when he surely had more than enough the opportunities not to be it. 
" But for what reason will I eat hamburger outside of house, if inside of I have fillet"?, used to he joke same. 
In the sky you assisted him the pride that in the earth their daughters coincide with their fans, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the big papers that he interpreted, of none it was as proud as of that of devote husband, father lover, solicitous grandfather and dedicated humanitarian", they say. 
The imperfect career of an olympic Madrid 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that they take place in Madrid some olympiads and, after the bankrupt one 2012, he/she can that it is the 2016. 
But do I wonder, are we prepared? 
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say that not! 
The perfect career called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst career with a lot in the one that I have been. 
A height of absurdities that, certainly, if they kept it in mind as evaluation and me he/she examined, it would be a very clear flunk. 
But we go for parts and from the beginning. 
The absurdities begin with the collection of the number that makes you have to go before. 
That which I don't find bad, but if they already make you go that they give everything (included the chip to avoid lines in the career). 
Because not. 
Here only they made you go to pick up the number (first absurdity, to only go for that) and (after the pertinent line), surprise!, there was only size ' S' for the T-shirt (second absurdity, because I need a size XL) 
In what world do we live? 
or is it that for the crisis they have decided to only buy small T-shirt with less cloths and cheaper? 
Because well, things like these are a minutiae compared with those of the day of the career. 
Apart from that to have to go very soon to pick up the chip, the line when arriving is of 15 minutes and, also, it is necessary to leave the backpack. 
More than 35 minutes the wait lasted, something incomprehensible for a career where it is expected to more than 11.000 people. 
Then, like it was of waiting, the career began and we had not still left the backpack, although once gotten, the collection was worse. 
Also, the rain livened up the wait of more than 40 minutes that he/she joined with attempts of popular rebellion and I assault to the hut. 
I believe that some 500 people tomorrow we will surely have pneumonia, and some as me, will not even appear with the correct time in the classification, due to the chip that gave me that, I imagine, it didn't mark me correctly the exit. 
Certainly, if to me they asked me for the perfect career, this he/she would not enter in my thoughts. 
So I believe that we will continue dreaming of a very prepared olympic city. 
Microsoft looks for receptionist (virtual) 
In the conference of Emergent Technologies of the MIT Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, kind of an Artificial Intelligence without a lot of intelligence but able to carry out some basic tasks, as requesting a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move for the campus of the company) assisting to what listens in the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition in ways and faces, this " receptionist " can know how many people there is in the room, who are - even to remember what they wear - and to listen and to understand the key words of his conversations. 
Also to contain to the present according to the conversation groups. 
In the sample videotape the receptionist a third person detects but she understands that you/he/she doesn't belong to the group that she is speaking with her and that she is not an employee of the company. 
He/she asks him if it is there to visit somebody and he/she tells him that he/she will assist him shortly. 
Everything without blue pantallazo. 
Impressive. 
But that, clear, it is the future. 
Now the company has better things in those that to concentrate, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week one has spoken very above a strategy change in Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be slighter and he/she won't have so many programs associates. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the indispensable thing instead of loaded with commercial basurilla, they would go quicker five times - man, Steve, will already be for less. 
An entire discovery keeping in mind that Microsoft, version after version, he/she has added functions and " extras " to Windows. 
The direction change is appreciated. 
Microsfot is right, the operating system goes losing importance, and also the software. 
When Google Chrome came out to the net, one of those that was added to the theory was that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many pointed out with success that a navigator is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the indispensable layer so that the Hardware and the Software understand each other. 
It completes the same function that their wife or their husband when you have to say something to their mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
It will never disappear but it is necessary to think of the death of the operating system I don't eat an absolute truth, but relative. 
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
People every time ready less attention to the operating system, and more to the navigator web. 
The computer you only starts up to execute the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day more time passes navigating that in the environment of windows. 
For what reason do they serve half of the applications that you/they come in the system? 
Fewer are more. 
And Windows 7 have to be less, much less that Seen. 
Less heavy, less elaborate, less complex. 
To Microsoft it interests him more to integrate their services online and that they are finally an alternative to Google. 
They need it hopelessly, in fact, and I bring a small example. 
The picture of this post I took it in one of the rooms of rest for employees of Microsoft, in Redmond, at the beginning of month. 
In the machine of sodas a poster asks them them to use its search tool - Your search. Our future." 
In the year 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees of Microsoft used Google to look for in the net. 
Last week, by the way, you also confirmed a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It won't arrive at the beginning of 2009 but to final, rather throwing at 2010. 
In Microsoft they will surely look for the combined launching of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after everything, is every day more computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already in the street, it will pass invoice. 
Him Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso took it in the Blue Costa, Leonardo gave Caprio one it shone in ' Diamond of sangre' of Edward Zwick, the same thing that To the Pacino in ' Francis' Padrino' Ford Coppola and it is part of the uniform of the parish gay musculada. 
And if we begin to enumerate stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that stalwart one of pointed mustache that he/she lifted weights in a traveling circus. 
In essence, it is not more than the typical masculine T-shirt of interior in cotton, tight and without sleeves. 
The ' tank' that call the speaking anglos, but him Fabuleux Marcel of Bruxelles blunts on all the other ones. 
First, for their grandiloquent name - although colloquially he/she knows it to him as ' Marcel' - that he/she has to do with the sport because he/she receives their name, according to bill the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the singer's lover Edith Piaf. 
' The Marcel' highlights on the other ones for its excellent cotton, for its unisex court, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that the T-shirt models more emblemáticos takes like detail in the neck. 
And attention, because the production of the Belgian signature is not only centered in its tank tops. 
It also includes sudaderas college, boxers retro, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, seafaring T-shirt, babies, mini shorts... 
You are captivated thought for the comfort underwear. 
Although it is a pain to leave them as underwear. 
They have too much charm. 
"I want to be young mom; I don't worry about the candidate" 
Its enormous resemblance with its sister has not prevented him to develop its own personality. 
Mónica Cruz is small but full with vitality. 
At the moment the sisters Cruz takes his new activity very seriously in the fashion. 
For Mónica, they are much more than some handsome and famous girls that lend their name. 
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the signature Mango makes in its new headquarters, besides the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion that the house Spanish esponsoriza. 
Warm and shy, it wins in the short distances. 
Count us that you make in Paris. 
I have come to present the new collection that we have devised my sister Penelope and me for Mango in this new season autumn-winter, besides attending the presentation of the second edition of those ' Mango Fashion Awards' and to the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino. 
We go, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting. 
Is your new collection based for Mango on this fourth season working for the Spanish house in what? 
As much to my sister as to me we love the cinema of the years 50 and 60; of there we take out many references. 
Then, I like a lot to get lost for a city and to observe the women like they go dressed, like they combine and they mix their clothes, I make it a lot. 
Dancer, actress and designer, are you a very versatile woman, not? 
I believe that yes but, at the end, everything unites and they have many knots in common. 
To me from small liked clothes; he/she wanted to go to my grandmother's house to poke in my aunt's closets and to see their clothes. 
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the park of attractions. 
Then, of dancer, he/she always tried to take care how I got dressed. 
You already know that it likes us a lot to the dancers to make us our estilismos for the classes and rehearsals, to look at us to the mirror and to feel well. 
And in actress's paper when they give you the wardrobe it is when you really find the character. 
Then, everything goes united, that yes, with a lot of respect toward the designers and profesionalidad. 
Have you completed he/she doesn't make the 30 a lot, has he/she entered you crisis? 
What he/she goes. 
I sit down better than never, to me I like the 30. 
I find that the woman is made, she has experience and you/he/she savors the life with less errors. 
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me. 
I have made the things that he/she wanted from small and this has given me a lot of internal happiness. 
Then, do you think of being mother or not? 
Certainly, I know that I will be mother because he/she requests it to me the body and, also, I want to be young mom; this doesn't want it to me to lose. 
As for the candidate, I don't worry about it. 
That will make it is to give a lot of happiness to my son and to educate him with a lot of love. 
As for the cinema, you are pending of several premieres that rotated the last year. 
It is this way and I already want them to see the light. 
I that am a woman that comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, all I want it it already stops and clear, it cannot be. 
I want them to open ' The last hora' and ' In search of the tomb of Cristo'. 
To see that you find... 
Some days ago you did debut on a gangplank with Naomí Campbell, not? 
Good, good, don't say that. 
It is not that goes up me to a gangplank to make of model. 
Simply, Naomí called me Campbell, to which know for some time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficent parade for her organization ' Women for a world mejor' and the clothes that we exhibit - I took out two pieces of our collection for Mango - I/you/he/she was auctioned to collect money for Naomí's ONG. 
People ignore Naomí's tender heart. 
So many things of her are said that, I that know it, would tell you that many are not certain. 
Also, I keep that part so good in which she is involved. 
It asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if I end up requesting that he/she made the pine, because also. 
To benefit the women of the third world, that is necessary. 
The recurrent drivers for alcohol rate will install the ' alcolock' 
Interior wants that the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol rate, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents to pull up the drunk vehicle, or if it is not blown. 
The initiative last month of June it was already announced and now he/she already appears included in the annual memory of the General Office of the State, according to which is a project pilot that will have a duration of one year. 
Their purpose is the driver's reinserción, for what this will also receive a course of reeducación vial. 
In the experience, besides the General Office of Segurida Vial, will participate the General Address of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for the Security of the Automobile (FITSA). 
According to the statistics, among 30% and 75% of the drivers denounced more than once to drive drunks he/she catches the car again. 
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a connected system to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and it prevents to pull up the automobile if the driver doesn't blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected it is superior to the one allowed. 
Their cost is superior to the 1.000 Eurus and foray for bill of the one sanctioned. 
In this sense, a study carried out in USA in 2007 demonstrated that the vehicles equipped with these devices reduce until in 65% the infractions during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save the life to 115 people every year. 
The measure sticks to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to approach those behaviors before they derive in penal crimes. 
And to facilitate their implementation, since the legal reformation one can make for via ordinary, and, however, the necessary reformation for the penal road demands a reformation in an organic law. 
The device is not still available in the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been implanted in an experimental way in some industrial vehicles and of public service. 
In fact tomorrow, the Congress of the Deputies will vote tomorrow an initiative of the PSOE in which intends to settle in the school buses this system, the same as it has been carried out in France. 
In Mexico and without ' peep-toes ' 
With British punctuality, at 17.40 o'clock, the hour foreseen in the program, Benito landed in the presidential Hangar of the airport Juárez from Mexico DF the airplane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled. 
The sun was of retreat but its rays still forced to use the hand by way of visor to see the real couple descend of the airplane. 
On foot of escalerilla, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities. 
Hours before he/she had asked down the street, to the taxi driver, if he/she knew that the Spanish Princes visited the city to formalize an official trip. 
- Ah, very good, then won't be able to leave to the airport to load at that hour... She is of here or this way... 
- No, not Mister, she is Spanish but he/she lived a couple of years here. 
- Ah, very good... 
But the Mexican press yes he/she knows very well who the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the trip are. 
They are many those that wait in the hangar of the airport hit to the red carpet and a military barrier formed by 27 soldiers of marine that you/they interpret the salvo of honors. 
The Prince appears smiling, dress of navy blue, and her, the Princess, mane to the wind, very sober, it doesn't use their ' peep-toes ' habitual, they had maybe communicated him that in the DF he threatened storm. 
They give a smile and a concise stop to the photographers before passing to the room in which waits the official cortege. 
In the door of the hotel in the one that lodge, big one of the four of the city, he/she waits them a reportera dicharachera of Mexican television. 
The better prize endowed with the fashion 
Don't possibly have place in the most appropriate world to present a prize in fashion that Paris and don't possibly have a more exquisite alive designer and bont they live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-mango Fashion Awards, for potenciar the international projection of the new talents of the fashion. 
It is endowed with a prize of 300.000 Eurus. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the winning Belgian of the first edition, looked at her designs in the window of Mango in the number 54 of the boulevard Haussmann of Paris and almost she cried of the emotion. 
By the way that it is the second bigger store of the signature in Europe and it has just inaugurated with 1.335 square meters of surface. 
The first one is in London. 
So many events, together to the desire of thanking the designer Valentino that presided over the jury of the contest, made us to end up in a deluxe dinner in the opera Garnier of Paris. 
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, elegance's presidential table prepared by Mango, shone even more spectacular. 
Nati, with the left heart of pain and making of tripes heart, for their brother's recent death, he/she put on a suit of the House and some seasonings of ELAH that cut the breathing, and of their son's arm Luis - a canyon of almost two meters of longitude - it accompanied Valentino in the presidency of their dinner homage. 
Andik, owner and gentleman of Mango, made the honors and it is so gentleman that ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because both he/she had lent them to two ladies. 
Mónica Cruz that went to the store with pants and shirt - of own design - and for the dinner he/she transformed with a black long sexy dress, he/she was moved when in the night walk for the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, the room of ballet rehearsal and she taught us, remembering other times, he/she held on to one of the bars and he/she made an attempt of ' grand plie'. 
Inés Sastre didn't stay to the walk for the dependences of the palace, but before he taught us in his son's telephone mobile pictures. 
The following morning we could be happy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves in moto - and for John Travolta that arrived at the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with their sheets, their towels and having requested previously that there are not scents in their room. 
Stars under the starry sky of Paris. 
Oh là là, c'est the vie. 
1001, the number antiestrés 
There are not 1000 but 1000 more a ways of forgetting the chaotic and frantic daily life. 
And for if it was little, all are gathered in a book that he/she will bring the relax to the bookstores September 30. 
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 in the morning, but it is still worse to imagine wrapped in the upset rhythm that imposes the current life. 
The office is called tension and the computer back pain. 
The estrés is the wrong of the XXI century. 
But there are not one neither two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the desconexión problems with the labor world. 
No, the number ascends to, nothing else and anything less that 1001. 
To the margin of the yoga positions, the classic massage or the treatments of ' spa', Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book all a ' menú' of possibilities adapted to the pleasure and minutes of each one. 
The work antiestrés is called ' 1001 relajarse' ways and its calm will arrive at the bookstores of the hand of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If somebody considers that it is not possible to reach the tranquility in environments like the work or through the personal relationships, this ' manual' denies such a belief. 
Also, he/she offers other procedures like to be in contact with the nature or recipes 100 natural% that contribute to the relaxation. 
If the adrenaline no longer runs for your veins to restore the balance of the body and the estrés he/she has become a problem, it is hour of sitting down in the sofa, to disconnect the mind and to concentrate on the reading. 
To speak sleeping 
Some children speak at night. 
I don't refer to these that you/they wake up very espabilados being something that the previous day has passed, but to children that speak being sleeping. 
The first time that happens perhaps you take yourselves a fright, but in fact he/she doesn't have importance. 
It is a benign alteration of the dream that somniloquios is called. 
It is quite frequent, mainly in children and adolescents. 
For sure to more than one they have counted him that he/she spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporadic way (once in a lifetime for example associated to an episode of high fever), or in a more periodic way (every day, once a week, once in months...), the following day the boy doesn't remember anything. 
An unique cause that determines its appearance doesn't exist. 
Often they go related to other alterations of the dream like they are usually the nightmares, the night terrors, the night enuresis (to be made slept pis) or the sonambulismo, but he/she doesn't have reason to be this way. 
As we have already mentioned they can previously also go associated to squares of very high fever, to estrés situations or overexcitement. 
Anyway it is a phenomenon little studied. 
The intensity with which appears is also very variable. 
It can be that he/she speaks in a calm voice tone, loose words, a murmur or just the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...). 
In the cases in those that the manifestation is very intense would suit to observe the boy and to consult with a specialist, to check if there is some question that is generating a lot of anxiety and it is left him this way. 
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore he/she doesn't have treatment, unless he/she goes associated to another alteration of the dream that yes it can be (for example, if he/she goes associated to apnea of the dream or to an estrés square). 
That that yes one can make it is to keep in mind a series of such very simple preventive measures as: 
To try not to excite the boy a lot before go to sleep. 
Therefore to look for calm games and to avoid programs or television series that are of fear or a little violent. 
With very nervous children and that they find difficult a lot to relax, they can be used technical of relaxation to help them to acquire a certain calm it interns. 
This will favor that the boy can have a calmer dream. 
Once the somniloquias appears you try to maintain the calm. 
Remember that they are inoffensive for the boy and that the following day he/she won't remember anything of what has happened. 
Useful Council 
You don't wake up him. 
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and the dream will break him. 
Although he/she is speaking, he is sleeping and therefore he/she is resting. 
Remember that if it is shown very broken-hearted during several episodes it would suit to consult or to discover what it is what generates so much anxiety in the boy. 
If he/she understands each other what says (that is not the most habitual thing), you don't fall in the temptation of making him an interrogation to wheedle him information. 
You won't get anything, because when being sleeping it is not conscious as to organize their thought. 
You will also hear what says, but you don't know what is dreaming to say that, with that which much care in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions that you take out. 
You never tell to the boy that you can interrogate him at night to know their secrets. 
Not even in jest. 
That generates a lot of anxiety. 
In summary, you don't worry, it is not anything bad, it is an episode that only lasts some minutes. 
Illhaeusern finally! 
The soccer club, Illhaeusern, found finally the one on the way to the victory in its field after a long period of shortage. 
Without having made a good party, the team creó many goal occasions and it was capable to make a goal to win the party. 
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty to be expressed. 
After the captain's first tentative Kauffmann that touched the squad from a distance with a shot, Illhaeusern quasi he/she will take the " power " and for shift Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or Diebold also came to impede the defense of Dannemarie. 
In front, we didn't allow to pass the centrocampista and we only left Riahi in attack position. 
The principle of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, very located to pick up the ball rejected in a first tentative of Diebold (53 '). 
But the scorer Illhousiens won't be able to savor a lot of time its happiness and it will be forced to return later in the wardrobes a dozen of minutes and to leave this way its team partners in numeric inferiority. 
But Dannemarie won't take advantage of the occasion and it won't be a problem for the eleven illhousiens that went back a little to compress its defense, except in the last seconds of game during the one which, after an important one he/she babbles, the ball passed very near the traverse field.

The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Stain, like in Them Sable d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Him Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trade ships. 
The fishermen of The Turballe and of Croisic, in the region Loira-Atlantic, they stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges. 
The fishermen of Boulogne-south-Mer they decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday that will take place to the ministry to think of eventual actions. 
In Guilvinec, the crisis committee will have to think on Tuesday of the development of the movement and in its participation in the encounter foreseen in the Ministry of the Agriculture and of the Fishing in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen don't want to be represented for responsible for the national committee of the fishing that didn't sustain their movement. 
" The strike will continue because the fishermen didn't abandon and they don't want to move toward Paris", he/she announced Liliane for example Cariou, the president of the committee of the fishing of Lorient. 
The professional fishermen that don't pay rates on the gasoil, pay at the moment near 50 cents for liter but they consider that you can only reach the point of financial balance of a ship with a gasoil with an inferior price to 0,30 euro for liter.

He/she has good instincts", it prevented Bill nevertheless Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenario McCain put in evidence its unquestionable experience as regards foreign policy, underlining its opponent's ingenuousness on these questions that were in the heart of this first confrontation. 
" The senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that? " it accused in several times. 
" I don't believe that the senator Obama has the experience and the necessary knowledge to be a president", it also assured. 
These words have been repeated from yesterday in the republican televised publicities. 
Obama underlined that it represented the future. 
Without being confused, it was shown concise and I specify. 
It enhanced their capacity to make the good decisions, and of restoring the image of the United States in the world. 
" McCain has not still understood, while Obama, he/she has already made it", he/she replied, this weekend, a democratic television publicity that reproached to the republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans." 
" During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things that to say on me, but anything on you, Obama, yesterday, denounced before 20 000 people that had met for an electoral meeting in low North Carolina a hefty rain. 
It didn't pronounce the words " middle class " or " workers ". " The financial defeat Obama that is considered by the Americans as the character favors clearly abler of saving the economy that is on the edge of the cliff. 
" Next week it could be a decisive episode", it estimated, yesterday, the influential and democratic senator Talks Schumer. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an old mimbro of the administration Clinton, compared the good economic instincts of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
According to the democratic candidate, the disaster current financiario it is the final consequence of eight years of a bad politics economic setting in execution for George Bush and sustained by the senator McCain." 
Reaffirming that it would end up in spite of everything reducing the taxes of 95% of the Americans in spite of the frights of Wall Street, the senator from the Illinois also pointed out that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of the renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a system of security and health. 
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations of here at 2030. 
Wise, both candidates avoided the questions that referred to the plan of financial salvage of 700 thousand million dollars (470 thousand million Eurus) adopted yesterday afternoon for the Congress and extremely unpopular. 
" In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk? " 
Young and opponents manifested last Sunday in the afternoon in the main square of the capital bielorrusa to reject the results of the legislatives in advance. 
Some hundreds of Bielorrusos met on Sunday in the afternoon from the closing of the electoral centers in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislativas. 
While no result had still been announced, numerous youths had come to manifest against the president's power Alexandre Loukachenko: " the dictator, has to resign." 
Some recognize not to have voted: " for what reason, since they will make what you/they want with my vote", a youth says. 
They don't believe that the régime that put good face to the foreign observers with the purpose of renovating the contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change. 
The sanctions, among those which l'interdiction of visas for 40 directing bielorrusos and the freezing of certain assets, they could be lifted if these elections are considered as clean for the observers. 
They were not it according to the opposition. 
" We have been put beside the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the recount of the votes", Iouri regretted Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of the democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties. 
" It is a cosmetic change, Alexandre underlines Milinkievitch, old candidate of the opposition to the presidential election of 2006 and leader of the movement European pro, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power. 
If some deputies of the opposition enter in the parliament, it is because they will have been designated but non elects. 
" But its entrance to the parliament can mean appearances in television, meetings in the regions and law proposals. " 
The opposition should then of entering in the political game because it is necessary to begin the dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy that has many debts in front of Russia, enters in crisis, and if we don't reform ourselves, we are in danger of being made a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent." 
The opposition fears the Organization for the security and the cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process not to recognize the validity of the voting. 
He/she underlines that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) it favored the manipulations. 
" Have you noticed the elections? It interrogates the leader socialdemócrata Alexandre Kozouline, one of last two political prisoners liberated in August of this year. 
There was not nobody in the electoral centers. 
And there will be as maximum five deputies from the opposition to the parliament, those that suit better to the power. " 
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October. 
In television, the president Loukachenko and the members of the electoral central commission are congratulated by their success. 
The interview - it Bleeds it is safe again 
Héma-Québec he/she took place yesterday their 10° anniversary of their foundation, and their president, Francine Décary, was right of being happy, because Héma-Québec it has been one of the surest and effective suppliers in blood in the world again. 
And mainly, it reconquered the public's trust that seriously had been hesitated by the scandal of the blood contaminated in the years 1980 and 1990. 
As it is known, the national reservations of blood administered by the Service of sanguine transfusion of the Cruz Red Canadian have been contaminated by the Virus of Human Inmunodeficiencia (VIH) and the virus of the hepatitis C during the years 1980. 
In front of this drama and to the public's dissatisfaction, the government from Canada made in February of 1994 a public survey, presided over by the judge Horacio Krever that sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster doesn't reproduce more. 
While the judge Krever took in presenting its relationship, certain counties then created a committee that had as objective to plan a new system of administration of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau completed this mission. 
In consequence of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood to supply all the other counties and both territories. 
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec it began their activities, almost people's 38% still trusted the system of blood in Quebec, Décary remembers. 
The situation was desalentadora. 
After having made many efforts to improve the security of the products sanguine and a lot of work during the years that continued, we have recovered the public's trust", he/she says before affirming proudly that at the beginning of 2008, near the population's quebequesa 94% he/she had in the successive trust in Héma-Québec. 
The doctor Décary remembers nevertheless in that the trust is something extremely fragile." 
From their creation, September of 1998, 28 Héma-Québec it applied the principle of caution. 
In that time, we attended in Europe to the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the illness of the crazy cow, a new variant of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, Décary counts. 
And we didn't know if this illness could be transmitted by the blood. 
Then we lean on in one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to the one which when we don't know it and when a serious illness can emanate of that, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that takes inevitably to the death, establishes exclusion measures. 
In April of 1999, because we deny the blood of people that you/they had remained more than one month in the United Kingdom from the 1980. 
But, some years ago, it has been demonstrated outside of everything he/she doubts that this illness is transmitted by the blood. 
This episode showed us so the principle of caution that was applied he/she had of the sense. " 
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of detection of the VIH appeared in the market: the tests of sour nucleído that allow to detect directly in the blood of the donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, in those that the tests were based used up to now. 
The tests of sour nucleído allowed to shorten the period among the moment in that the person has been infected and the moment in that the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains. 
We could reduce this period in an inferior duration to one week. 
The risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it diminish this way substantially and that we cannot detect them. 
These improvements allowed to get the risk considerably off contracting the AIDS for a transfusion of blood. 
Today in day, a person each 12 millions the risk runs of receiving blood contaminated by the VIH. 
"That means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million sanguine products before somebody is infected by the VIH. 
This way since Héma-Québec it distributes every year between 400 000 and 500 000 sanguine products, they will spend more than 24 years before a case of transmission of the VIH happens for a sanguine product. 
I believe that one can today in day to receive or to prescribe a transfusion of blood to recover the health without concerns", the boss of the address affirms of Héma-Québec. 
" Our challenge for next decade it is to maintain the security of our products. 
It is never known which patógeno could emerge in the system. 
The last year the virus appeared in the island of the Meeting Chikungunya that, to example of the virus of the western Nile, it is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant", the doctor pursues Décary before underlining that besides a sure supply, Héma-Québec you/he/she should also foresee an enough supply. 
" The necessities increase because the population ages. 
Since the treatments more aggressive cancerigenic anti, the patients often need an injection of red globules or of plaquetas. 
The population's aging also has consequences on the net of the donors of blood that it half only regroups for term 3% from acceptable Quebequeses to the donation of blood. " 
All the people with good health, 18 years old and that they correspond however to the approaches of admissibility they can donate blood every 56 days, that is to say six times a year. 
For half term, 14% of people that proposes its blood is not accepted, because they suffer of AIDS or of malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where the malaria reigns, they will be excluded during a period of one year. 
" With 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that covers the necessities of the hospitals. 
The penuries are very strange. 
But it is necessary to renovate the members of this net of donors as they age and more cannot donate their blood. 
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but mainly to retain them and to incite them to be regular donor. 
Since the current life is very wild, we rarely find the time for one hour to pass to donate its blood", Francine Décary is afflicted. 
With a budget of 297 million dollars yearly, Héma-Québec it not only supplies sanguine products, but also human fabrics, among those that bony implants, heart valves, ocular globes and skin that it is almost exclusively used for the big ones burnt. 
These fabrics are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec that also negotiates the only public bank of blood of the umbilical cord in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was considered as biomedical waste it is full with a rich blood of cells mother that you/they can be used for the treatment of serious illnesses as the leukemia. 
" We have taken place some weeks ago, the setting in the bank of our thousandth sample of blood of the umbilical cord and it is hoped to take out more than thousand of these per year. 
We would have to begin to propose it at the beginning for implants of next year", precise Doctor Décary that describes this program of taking of cord blood like very popular. 
" Many moms are disappointed of not being able to enjoy this", since Héma-Québec he/she doesn't have resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals of Quebec. 
Softbol - The Impact in the semifinals

Shortly? The victorious goal of Kovalev 
The trio number one of the Canadian is willing to undertake the season. 
The unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a gain for 3-2 of the Canadian to the shots free barrier in front of the Panthers of Florida, last night, in the Center Bell. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the encounter, marked a goal, Plekanec two help, and Kovalev you/he/she accumulated I pick up a pass in this gain, the room of the Tri-colored one in six preparatory parties. 
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only goal. 
" I am not still clever, Russian prevented. 
" It is necessary me another party to feel comfortable. " 
It tried to play to the maximum in the first time, Guido wrote down Carbonneau. 
But I think that it appreciated the end of the party. 
He/she had a beautiful ovation. " 
Charest is in charge of of the North 
The first minister doesn't exclude of starting before final of year 
As soon as it finishes the general advice of the liberal Party, Jean Charest it was yesterday in Juan-check, in Quebec, where the new minister of the Health, Yves Bolduc (of left), he/she tries to be made choose during today's partial election. 
To reject the limits of our last great frontier of the north": such it is the long term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying in the big lines, at the end of the general advice of the liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during their speech, images were projected. 
They paraded, in three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, of mining exploitation, of Quebec seen by Google Maps", maps, etc. 
Big means like during the electoral period. 
The first minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he made see that his schedule was very full. 
The North Plane is the fourth side of a " vision " that the first minister seeks to have for Quebec, that of a new economic space", which understands an agreement on the manpower with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario. 
Often mentioned recently in the first minister speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49° parallel - it had never been object of a presentation. 
The first minister was limited nevertheless to explain why the North was a jewel to the immense potential", but he/she didn't give a term, investment amounts, neither precise priority in the future projects. 
That that mainly could be more developed they are: particularly the hydroelectricity, the forest, but mainly the mining sector, dopado for the growth of the emergent countries and the reconstruction of the public infrastructures. 
The North contains nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest. 
This territory twice big as France", it is our house, it is in Quebec. 
It is not only to our house, but rather it is in us", he/she insisted, like to show that he/she requested a myth national founder. 
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he/she underlined: the spate toward the gold in Abitibi, the engineering quebequesa, the Bay James. 
" It belongs us, it is our future", he/she added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory quebequés, he/she understands the Farmer's part that Quebec always claimed, the first minister specified during the press conference. 
" It is a traditional position that all the governments reiterated. 
There is a frontier line in which you/they don't go of agreement for a lot of time and, when the occasion is presented, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government", it indicated. 
Also, with the climatic changes, there is that repensar to our vision of the North", he/she declared speaking of the passage of the northwest that will open up every year due to the foundry of the ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister considers that to occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites? 
The first minister said that the government from Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly to the youths. 
Two old minister that come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (old deputy of the party quebequés of Ungava), consultations already began near a thirty of communities. 
A committee interministerial presided over by Benoît Pelletier and in the one which Julie Boulet (it Transports and natural Resources) he/she has an important paper it began some works. 
The first minister doesn't exclude an important encounter, not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which a common vision will be given." 
The development of the North would be made in conformity with the principles of the sustainable development. 
The North Plan will be concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment", he/she promised. 
Jean Charest described this " vision " like one that is in continuity with of the first liberal minister which you/they preceded him. 
" As the liberal that preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges in new occasions of growth and of development. " 
This was one of the recurrent topics of weekend that began on Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50° anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions intends to rebaptize the Central Beauharnois in Reservoir Adélard-Godbout. 
" Of Godbout that creó HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the calm Revolution and the nationalization of the hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay our James party knew how to forge the future", Juan declared Charest. 
In the press conference, it invoked another reference, that conservative, the program Roads to the North of John Diefenbaker, first minister from the 1957 up to the 1963. 
Playing the topic of the project of hydroelectric reservoir of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest underlined that its setting in service is foreseen by the 2012. 
" This stays among us, but I foresee to be there", it trusted their militants, raising applauses. 
Indeed, the first minister that said in April that you/they would not take place elections in 2008 and without a doubt not in 2009, it didn't discard the possibility to start a voting this autumn, what the law allows him. 
He/she underlines that their schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the advice of the federation in China and a Quebec-New summit York York. 
The general advice of weekend supplied the liberal boss particularly a platform that contained nationalist resolutions, constitutional aspirations that didn't have problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of the Quebec claims the recognition of the specificity of Quebec in particular in the Constitution. 
He/she also wants that Quebec names members of the Council of the broadcasting and of the Canadian telecommunications and that these are entitled a veto about the decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the big lines of the North Plan with scepticism. 
The boss of the party quebequés, Pauline Marois, made stand out the Politics of development of the North of Québec that the government Landry had rushed in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, arriving to the power in 2003, it gave up to apply it. 
If he/she had made it, we would be progressed today in day Sra he/she commented Marois beside their candidate in Jean-check (voting that today was made), Françoise Mercure. 
The Democratic Action of the Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan on behalf of the government. 
" But what is wanted, is that this is not exactly a show", the leader commented Sebastien Proulx, in substitution of Mario Dumont that returns of vacations today. 
Letters - A dishonored country 
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of the " Justice " (oh irony!) in the cabinet Harper that was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a " shame " for Canada. 
To dishonor this way this woman that took an incessant combat for the justice and that it deserves all our admiration what tells all envelope the first minister relationships and of Stephen Harper. 
We are in a government's front that is the only one, among all the implied western countries that it has not repatriated to their national one that is locked in the field of concentration of Guantánamo. 
He/she is a government that doesn't keep in no way in mind the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent when the facts that are recriminated him happened. 
The only government that, in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Agreement of Geneva, it renounces its promise and he/she allows to live under inhuman conditions a boy-soldier. 
The only one that chonta with a false justice to evaluate the accused's guilt. 
Let us remember that the UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Association of the Canadian lawyers, particularly, they sustain the repatriation of Omar Khadr with the purpose of that he/she enjoys the benefit of an equal process in Canada. 
He/she is this government that closes the eyes on the torture: little he cares that a mature youth is destroyed psychologically, without a doubt forever after so many years of exactions. 
We don't still realize that, but we attend an insidious erosion of our rights at this time, of our freedom and of our " democracy ", that is the word that continuous Harper to repeat and that he/she doesn't make sense. 
It has already arrived the hour in which no morals exists more: can we mistreat, to torture, does to imprison a Canadian citizen arbitrarily as Government's boss want up to now minority (what will it pass after the 14 of octubre ?). 
Many voters believe that they will find the salvation in a party that praises the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they don't come that this government gave up that he made the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Mr. Toews the shame is caused by this renouncement and for nothing else. 
Free opinion - The speech orwelliano of Barrick Gold 
In their edition of September 17, Him Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and director of the mining Canadian Barrick Gold. 
Following a logical orwelliana, Barrick Gold affirms that the biggest auriferous company in the world attempted a process for libel of six million Eurus against three authors and a small house editorial with the purpose of causing a transparent public debate." 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not mainly the true that you/they judge, in the case of persecutions for libel, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is totally hidden by Mr. Garver. 
Reason, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way of taking a public debate be to harm whichever he/she dares to sustain a position contrary to his? 
The result of the case has little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada they will spend supreme considerable with the purpose of preparing its defense and of fighting, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers sustained by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining one. 
The tactics, in these unequal fights, is often it consists on ruining the defendants with the purpose of imposing a friendly arrangement that will gag the opposition besides scaring whichever he/she will dare to examine the question again. 
If Barrick Gold had truly wanted a public debate, it is before the public opinion that would have had to present its vision of the facts. 
Contrarily to what is made in several of countries where Barrick works Gold, the debates in Canada are usually made by the change of ideas and not to garrote blows. 
It was enough because that the mining one opens their books, their files and establishes a true debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent teams of search that you/they had been able to clarify the question. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and it rejects the petitions and the support letters for the authors of Noir Canada. 
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he/she can request a public debate rejecting the opinions of this? 
According to the vice-president, it seems that this word only designates the very paid lawyers and it doesn't stop the whole Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept. 
In democracy, the detractors are also entitled the of speaking. 
What doesn't understand - or what doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that sustains the authors and the editors of Noir Canada makes it mainly because it rejects the brutal way of the mining one. 
This public is willing to listen Barrick and to judge it, but having like base civilized changes of arguments, and not in the mark of what many people perceive like a persecution-gag (pursuing the public debate", Barrick Gold has just deposited a requirement with regard to the authors of Noir Canada becoming intimate them to that you/they don't use more this word). 
Besides the speech surreal of Mr. Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of university search and of the truth, essential even all the democratic societies. 
He/she denies the right of to mention believable sources and to make a debate on the facts and the interpretations that represent the base of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and to discuss on fellows that you/they dislike to the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under it punishes of many persecutions, who will be able to make it? 
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he/she could make it following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
He/she is entitled an answer. 
The university world, to which belong, knows for a lot of time to administer the debates and the disagreements and to solve the conflicts. 
The persecution desmesurada of Barrick Gold shows clearly that, contrarily to what seeks, he/she doesn't want to make a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is already hour that the governments place devices that limit this gender of abusive persecutions. 
Operation of rescue of Wall Street - Democratic and republicans agree 
The administration Bush and the leaders of the Congress, at the same time republican and democratic, finally they reached an agreement yesterday on the plan of more important economic salvage from the Great Depression of the years 30. 
The new version of the plan of 700 thousand million American dollars that seeks to brake the financial crisis that shakes Wall Street for months has to still be confirmed by both Cameras of the Congress. 
Prevé particularly: a better control on the part of the elects of their setting in application, of new mechanisms that seek to assure the refund of the invested public money, of the new dispositions to contain the number of levied houses the payment lack, as well as an inspection right on the paid wages to the leaders of the aided companies. 
The American secretary of the Treasure, Henry Paulson, the president of the Camera of the Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the republican representative in the table of negotiations, the senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news some minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations che they lasted two days. 
" We carry out big progresses with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets", the representative of the administration declared Bush, Henry Paulson. 
" Everything has been made to put to covered the economy and the ordinary Americans before the current crisis in Wall Street", the democrat explained. 
" It is the fundamental point: if we don't make this, the traumatism, the chaos and the interferences about the daily life of the Americans will be immense", the republican Judd declared Gregg. 
The negotiations had finished very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the humor of the investors. 
The last hour that you/they had noticed was the opening of the markets this morning. 
The two candidates in the American presidential elections that have adhered to late to the negotiations, were shown rather favorable for the agreement, without forgetting however to squeeze their dissatisfaction of being forced to arrive to this extremity. 
The democratic senator Barack Obama was conferred certain dispositions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the proprietors to conserve its home and the envelope the wage of the leaders of the surviving companies for the State. 
" When they are asked the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, it is not necessary to be congratulated. 
But these measures are necessary", he/she commented in American television. 
Their republican opponent, John McCain, Interrogated in another chain to know if he/she would vote for the proposed plan, he/she responded that: " I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote him. " 
" The important points that I read [they show] that is something that we will have to digest and with the one that we will be able to advance. 
He/she said that the option of not making anything is not acceptable." 
The plan of 700 thousand millions seeks to buy with the money of the taxpayers the doubtful debts, the assets to risks and unmarketable of the American financial institutions. 
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis caused by the explosion of a real state bubble that first it took to the sinking of the hypothecary credits of risk before extending to other forms more common of holding of credit (PCAA) and of causing a freezing of liquidity and a scattering of the banks and of the financial institutions. 
It is a group of republican elects that had made change the first agreement project, last week. 
We believe that we have left the stagnation since the democrats accepted that certain toxic assets of the companies in difficulty are solely assured by the government, rather that bought. 
With the objective of filing the roughness for everybody in the Congress, we also add a disposition that specified that if the government had to assume losses during five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would seek to help him to recover money. 
The new plan prevé the payment of a first part of 250 thousand millions to which you/they will be been able to add 100 other a thousand millions if the president finds it necessary. 
The payment of other 350 thousand millions would have to be confirmed by another vote on behalf of the Congress. 
On the other hand of their help, Washington will get participations in the aided companies that they will be worth him dividends in the event of earnings and that he/she will be able to sell again when the storm will be passed. 
The federal government will have the possibility to retard the procedures of seizures that concerned the housings obtained with real state loans according to this plan, as well as to fix limits on the remuneration and envelope the compensations in metallic paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis. 
The architects of the plan would want to see it subjected to the voting of the Camera of the representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday. 
In spite of all their efforts, it is not still for sure their plan will be approved. 
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, as much on behalf of the republicans as of the democrats. 
The republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission of the finances of the camera, declared to his voters that with all evidence, Washington doesn't want to understand." 
" We have a very serious financial problem. 
Some solutions exist. 
But not the one that consists on taking out the taxpayers' profit." 
The democratic representative Brad Sherman that is exciting of a small group in the Congress, presents the problems otherwise, but it reaches the same conclusion. 
" Four hundred professors of economy, among those that three Prizes Nobel, they wrote us to tell us: we ask to the Congress not to hurry and to examine the road that it is necessary to take sincerely", he/she declared yesterday. 
In this same moment, in Europe, we had another time the test of the world nature of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting, the three countries of the Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the bank group Fortis for 11,2 thousand million Eurus (16,3 thousand million dollars). 
The intervention of the governments from Belgium, Low Countries and of Luxemburg it had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas gave to know that he/she gave up to buy its competitor in crash since it lost 2 thousand million Eurus (2,9 thousand million dollars) during the crisis of the real state loans of risk in the United States. 
Fortis uses 85 000 people and it is part of the twenty bigger European banks and of the ten bigger insurers. 
" This is not lost money, he/she declared yesterday the minister neerlandés of the Finances, Wouter Bos. 
On the other hand, we recover a vote right in the bank and influence. 
It is exactly something that the savers and the families appreciated now that the times are uncertain. " 
During this time, to the other side of the Stain, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would be taken charge of all the pending loans in the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 thousand million Eurus (75,5 thousand million dollars) of real state loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander gave to know yesterday that is the one that would buy the branches and the bank bills of the British bank. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon 
Their blue eyes represented time therefore their victory. 
Had the American actor with a charming smile been liberated of his side narcisista? 
Yes and not. 
Their chastity, their sensibility and a talent that it was evident will also have taken it away from the registration of power that you/they have the true sacred monsters. 
But how great bottom corridor! 
Paul Newman, dead on Friday, to 83 years, because of a lung cancer in their ranch of Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema of the years remains fastos. 
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to who looked like each other a lot and that it was considered by a lot of time like a rival in the cinema, wiser in their game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and of the explosion of the dramatic agreements. 
The blended blood often make magnificent children. 
He/she was born in Ohio in 1925, of German Jewish father and of Hungarian origin mother. 
Of these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born. 
Without ego desmesurado, last mark of quality. 
Because in him he/she was projected an entire country in love with the self made man, of the combatant of the war of the Pacific, wounded in combat that at the beginning of the years 50 studied the dramatic art in Yale, then the Actor's frequented Studio of New York, before triumphing in the theater, in television and soon in the cinema. 
This man that militated for the civil rights was also the pilot automobile that was classified in second position in the 24 hours of Him Mans in 1979, bent by a sex symbol, although member of a model couple formed from the 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
They also disappear with him this secret, discreet and committed star's secret sides, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we don't know very well. 
He/she is a honest man, in the noblest sense in the word. 
Paul's death Newman caused the vertigo to the cinéfilos this weekend, while you entrechoquen its big papers in the black screen of the memories. 
More than a half century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parades through him. 
Many memories return to memory like the cow-boy with charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man that their sensual wife rejects (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the roof of adapted zinc of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
More near us (1990), we evoke to their sensitive Mister Bridge, perturbed by a marriage that didn't complete all their promises. 
Others as Paul Newman has passed to the history of the cinema. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, violent criminal, tormented, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked for the hate), of Robert Wise, a paper dedicated to James Dean, repeated after their death that truly threw Newman in 1956. 
This nice mangante in the magnificent movie The Sting (The Blow), Oscar to the best movie in 1973. 
Player of bitter and avenging billiards in the magnificent movie The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he/she will repeat to the character in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese that was worth him in 1987 their only Oscar among nine nominations. 
This face that changes with the years, era him. 
Still him. 
The times change during their career. 
The youths know it mainly thanks to Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a hockey team on not very orthodox ice. 
Their fans saw it in 1994 in The Hudsucker the siblings' Proxy again Coen. 
With a last paper of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the ripple was curly. 
Contrarily to several legends of the cinema that abandoned the career quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of the cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fastos and its concessions. 
The French film director Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, as a challenge that he/she lives in the underplaying and that he/she judges its too leaning benefits. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to which the papers arrived during a lot of time without making anything. 
However he/she less often interpreted the paper of young gallant that of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, he-goats or desperate whose features reflected the rebellions. 
As realizador, Newman not revealed sides its true modest sensibility very well-known. 
Their movie Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with their wife Joanne Woodward in the main paper, described a feminine portrait of melancholy. 
He that lost their son Scott because of overdose dedicated him their movie Harry and they are in 1984, work of chastity and of sadness. 
" Among the numerous homages that were unchained yesterday for Newman, their great friend and old partner of weapons Robert Redford (they had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) he/she affirmed, very saddened: " my life and my country were better thanks to their existence" 
Generosity, love of the existence is the died actor's important features. 
Of the other side of their legend career, he/she also hides a great militant for the civil rights, the ecology, the independent cinema, a polemic one against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We will have seen their face a lot reign on the boats of sauce vinaigrette, of the sauces, of the cookies and of other foods, judging this method like a method in poor taste, although it began as a gag. 
The profits of these sales were given to their Foundation for the childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather that to be satisfied of their myth, he/she will have committed until the end. 
He/she left their five daughters a letter that contained these sentences: " always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege of being there. " 
And a privilege for us of having followed the career of such a lucid and so generous American artist. 
In summary a model citizen. 
What it is what you/they took place in the factory of invoices Zuschlag &amp; Co. ? 
Very soon, October 8, the penal process will begin against János Zuschlag and its accomplices. 
It is accused the politician and their accomplices of making frauds of significant damage, in business way, continually and in organized form besides other crimes, among these the falsification of documents. 
According to the Office they used for own ends the funds obtained in the public competitions justifying in many occasions the execution of the tasks with false invoices. 
The public funds and that of the city councils - in their entirety some 65 millions of HUF - they stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of particular people. 
The method that was given to also know for the investigators, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public competitions with false invoices behind which there was not real execution, the different associations they never completed its assumed obligations. 
According to the accusation, most of the invoices were false. 
For they obtained it the checkbooks in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the question that on behalf of what company he/she should be carried out the falsified invoice he/she opted among others in that tour for the Superior Region of the Balatón where János Zuschlag sent to István Sides. 
This last he/she admitted that for this end he/she should choose inns and restaurants. 
He/she requested invoice for their consumptions and these they served as model to make the invoices that presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Juvenile and Sport Matters, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Matters, as well as in the City council of the Capital. 
These invoices were signed in their majority by István Sides and their accomplice András ?ri, who according to our informations rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public grants. 
During one of their trips of study Sides he/she chose a brewery. 
According to two invoices sent in 2003 by Zuschlag and their accomplices, this gastronomic center provided the food for a group of ninety people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people don't fit at the same time in that place. 
In a same way, the invoice sent in the summer of 2002 for the Foundation Jobb Jöv?ért - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - it was full with formal and contextual errors. 
Because an inn of the town of Badacsonytomaj only had three rooms and more than ten people they could not lodge there in one night, however in the invoice hundred and thirty people consisted. 
But the makers of invoice of great fantasy also exaggerated when they pointed out to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookkeeping of books of the same one - according to the informations given to the Office - they didn't have documents to name of Jobb Jöv?ért and of Hoppá. 
Gy?z? Farkas, the manager of this company, informed hvg.hu that when it was mentioned by the office and they showed him the invoices, he already knew that it was false documents. 
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in incorrect place." 
He/she added: besides the formal problems neither agreed that according to the invoice a hundred people lodged, since they only have eleven rooms in which so many people don't fit. 
Also, in the invoice they were also included foods, while the restaurant a while ago that it doesn't work. 
The manufacturing enthusiasts of invoices were not neither informed that the elected travel agency in Budapest organizes trips exclusively to the exterior, so that in the payment invoice cash indicated foolishly as service a trip inside Hungary, that which neither coincided with the practice of expedition of invoices of the agency. 
Also -such as it was known during the investigation - they also included in the document the IVA, although the trips outside of the territory of the European Union were exempt of taxes. 
Among other things the measure of the IVA was also incorrect in the four documents sent by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jöv?ért, since the services of this company are not loaded with a 25 but only with 15 percent of IVA, the employees of the hotel also extended only invoices made to machine however the invoice it was manual. 
The " senders " also made also other errors, like in the case of a company in the one that you/they put by lorry in the invoice like carried out activity the transport to the one which - it was known during the investigations of the office - he/she doesn't carry out the company been founded as consultant of investments. 
Equally for formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that they are false the invoices sent for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos stops Pont. 
The same as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfehértó whose representatives denied to have sent those invoices. 
The forgers neither paid attention to that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza it was in liquidation process, for that reason the one in charge of the liquidation process - according to our informations - he/she denied to have sent such a document. 
They sent the invoices consciously 
Another group of the makers of false invoices is constituted by those those that were aware that they should send fictitious invoices. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, to application of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, sent invoice for value of about four millions from HUF to name of the Foundation Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért. 
To the manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - one of the accused convinced him, Ludovic Györfi, to send fictitious invoices. 
In a same way the Biogate did collaborate with Zuschlag and its accomplices Kft., at the moment under liquidation process that in 2003 it gave invoices for an approximate value of five millions from HUF to the foundation Jobb Jöv?ért Alapítvány, to the association Atlasz Egyesület and to the association Vörösfeny? Egyesület, without real economic activity behind. 
There neither was not movement of capitals, because later they annulled the prepared invoices but they forgot to make consist in their documents to this entity. 
In the following group of the makers of false invoices those are included that have some linking with the accused. 
This way for example Iván Kubatov was the demandadero of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio CO.LTD. with fictitious headquarters in Budapest that was in charge of with the trade of fuels and of vehicles. 
This company sent numerous invoices for an approximate value of 18 millions of HUF in the months of October, November and December of 2005 on the sale of computer means. 
According to the data of the investigation these invoices were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas that is low liquidation process from September 14 2005. 
The manager of this company was a Rumanian to who Iván Kubatov should also have dispatched the documents related with the company between 2002 and 2005. 
We have informations that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that sent to name of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and Együtt stops Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount him same. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. they were founded for Rumanian bricklayers to expressed application of Iván Kubatov. 
However, none of the companies worked exactly due - according to the accused - to that didn't receive work. 
But it took out profit of these companies, since to their accomplice's application the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the documents of registration of the company, they sent invoices to name of the societies for the organizations linked with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the And-Generáció. 
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, of the Delta Trió, of the Fa-Bani Jos, of the Jos Investment and of the Linaxtrade he/she gave in total 15 invoices to different entities for a value of 14,2 millions of HUF. 
The Office considered that Kubatov received the IVA and 10% of the amount of the invoices. 
That man even took advantage of the society in Szi-Beri it floats to send fictitious invoices used in the competition of Biztos Pont. 
The And-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in the month of January from 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), entity of public utility of the Socialist Party. 
Of the competition 500 thousand HUF obtained respectively, but they didn't use the money for the objectives of the competition. 
So that this is not discovered, they presented to the TMA five received fictitious invoices of the Works Team Kft. 
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had in the headquarters of the Ministry of Education. 
It leaves of the accused they will probably relate in the trial - just as they made in the Office - the course of the falsification of the invoices. 
The most interesting thing will be able to be the own main accused's confession János Zuschlag, if he/she decides to dismantle everything. 
Because their confessions up to now have not been very detailed and although reiteradamente promised to speak of everything, this has not made it until the present. 
The question is: what interest does he/she have to make it?, because perhaps in exchange for the refund of most of the money - fifty millions of HUF - did the socialists reach an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities. 
Who, on the other hand, for these days until it could be offended, since to alleviate their prison conditions he/she requested domiciliary arrest, but it was denied him reiteradamente. 
While the numerous authors of economic crimes of very superior value that never returned the money, go for a walk freely or at least they can wait in their own home the sentence, he doesn't have possibility for that. 
Psychology of those superimposed: Why do we spend more money? 
The participants of the auctions are prone to spend more money and to overvalue the product. 
The neurologists and economists of the University of New York discovered the neurological bases - economic of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to the study appeared in the magazine Science, people don't want to lose in competitions like the eBay auctions, for that reason she even prefers to pay an excessive price. 
The scientists tried to establish the neurological outline of this " game " by means of experimental auctions. 
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, the other one it participated in an auction and meanwhile it was examined by means of the system of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of participant people in the experiment. 
In both games they could make money the participants, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental element to bet more than the other one, when losing the game the operation of the complex called stratum was intensified located under the cerebral bark. 
This area of the brain, besides many other functions, it plays a part in the mechanism of car prize of the nervous system. 
This way according to the scientists, the increase of the bets is explained like a prevention for not causing an intense reaction of the stratum. 
To base their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a study of financial pursuit. 
In this experiment three groups they bet against a person in different circumstances. 
To the control group he/she was simply communicated the real value of the product in question, and their members bet. 
To another group besides he/she was promised it that if they win, they would receive 15 dollars more than prize. 
On the other hand, the third group received 15 dollars exactly before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the members of the group they even lost that money. 
This way the only difference among the two groups was that one stops the victory it was stood out and for the other one the failure. 
However, checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group that played against the failure were willing to even bet more than the members of the control group and of the winning group. 
"These results cannot be deduced previously from any existent economic theory. 
Because those up to now only explained the phenomena of the auctions with the happiness of winning and with the prevention of the risks. 
The visual neurological methods only helped to solve this contradiction among the two theories, so now we arrive to a third explanation" - Andrew established Schotter, professor of the ability of economy of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When should he/she leave to the doctor? 
In the world about five hundred million people suffer of hepatitis B or chronic C, and in Hungary the chronic illness of the liver is considered one of the main causes of the death. 
It is calculated in a hundred thousand the number of having contaminated in this country, but seven thousand only receive since treatment many of the sick persons they don't know that they are contaminated. 
The hepatitis denomination is the name common of different illnesses of the liver caused by virus. 
The symptoms look like each other a lot; they are characteristic the infection of the liver and the jaundice, but their agents patógenos and the caused illnesses are very different. 
The virus of the hepatitis in the agent's patógeno dependence spreads by means of two main forms: the hepatitis TO and AND for via alimentary (for example with water or contaminated food), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with the blood and with corporal humors (sperm, humor of the vagina, salivates). 
It is advisable to the travelers to be protected by means of vaccine against the virus TO and B, against the C doesn't exist bovine. 
The symptoms of the hepatitis TO they appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, it is manifested by means of a not well general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nauseas. 
After they appear it in the skin and in the target of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the urine of dark color and the cure can even last two - three weeks. 
Annually a million people die in the world in cancer and hepatic cirrhosis caused by the hepatitis B, the most serious forms in this illness. 
The main reason of it is it that according to the calculations, contaminated one of each ten only receives pharmacological treatment. 
The hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce hepatic cirrhosis and even cancer. 
Most of those contaminated doesn't know that it is sick because this pathological agent destroys in gradual form the cells of the liver and many times the first symptoms they only appear later 20-30 years. 
Therefore it is very important the premature recognition, the systematic medical control. 
It is much more frequent this illness in three groups: people that had sanguine transfusion before 1991, the consumers of drugs and those that take tattoos. 
At the present time there are about 200 million people in the world that you/they suffer of hepatitis C chronicle. 
As to this illness it can also be discovered with a routine control of laboratory, it is worthwhile to consult with the doctor from the family when experiencing some unknown symptom. 
The illness has cure if he/she is discovered on time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the organism, you can suppress this way the infection and to prevent the cancer. 
September 30 are the World Day of the Hepatitis, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by the sick persons organizations representatives. 
Their objective is to get the attention to the causes of the chronic infections of the liver caused by the virus and to the importance of its premature recognition. 
Does it hurt him less to who they believe in God? 
According to the result of a recent investigation, the religious faith has soothing effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of the Catholicism. 
The scientists of the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment: they analyzed that in what way the religious belief influences in the human pain - he/she informed the British newspaper Telegraph. 
In the mark of this singular experiment they applied electric crash to 12 Catholic believers and the same quantity of atheists, meanwhile all were looking at the Virgin María's painting. 
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain. 
Thanks to the technique of escaneo of the human brain, you could verify that the Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This experiment is the first of the series of investigations in those that also participate beside the academics scientific, philosophers and theologians of the different departments of the University. 
The analysis happened in the following way; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric crash. 
The investigators requested to the participants of the experiment that fixed their look in two paintings; to the Virgin María, work of Sassoferrato of the century 17 and to the Lady of Leonardo's ermine he/she gives Vinci of the century 15. 
The investigators had the hope that the Virgin María's show would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful ones, as long as they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other one, and they thought that he/she had soothing effect. 
The patients spent half hour in a scanner of MRI, receiving in that period 20 electric crashes in four successive parts while they observed the painting of topic religious or the other one. 
The Catholics affirmed that when looking at the Virgin María they felt in " security " like protected people, they were tranquilized and in their heart the peace reigned." 
When observing the square of topic religious they felt 12 percent less than pain that when they looked at Leonardo's work. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias that participated also in the experiment, thinks that with any image so impactante you can also get an effect similar with the atheists, it is only necessary to find the appropriate image. 
"We should find the portrait of a person for which feel very positively, like for a mother or a father" - the psychologist said. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation. 
"The exercise of the faith would should and in many cases it really changes our personality" - Wright added. 
After these formidable results it is a single query: what effect would he/she have for the regulation of the pain if he/she was shown to the faithful ones Leonardo's Madonna or of another painter of their size? 
Would the vision of a Virgin María of high quality maybe throw even better results? 
You are what you say of yourself 
In their tenth birthday the Google can affirm: it can be found so much in people's pocket, like in the sky above their head; he/she knows where they passed their vacations, to what doctors they visit and what it is what interests them. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is not still enough. 
On the other hand the sceptic that make a parallel one with the vision orweliana don't come the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt recently declared to the periodic Financial Times that the main objective of Google is to gather the biggest quantity possible of personal data on its users, and this is necessary to be able to complete the original objectives of the founders of Google: " let us gather in a system all the informations of the world"!. 
According to the leader of the Google, the company even after ten years of work that it revolved to the World it is still in the initial phase of the zeal of being able to treat all the information. 
To the question that what it is what will spend in five years Schmidt he/she answered this way: did he/she want that the Google could answer to the questions like What to make tomorrow?" or Which would it be the work that better it would suit me?" - however, the software won't be able to answer to seemingly so simple questions while the users' enough informations don't exist. 
Not all the internet users are aware that during their sailing in the Net are stored the looked for key words, the addresses of IP and the pages where passed when finishing the search accurately. 
Thank you for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, the users can store their own sailing record, they consult what you/they looked for before, what you/they opened up again and thanks to this record it will generate searches much more personalized -in this same logic the Recommendations it will be based, in which the system will offer us products and services in base of the previously defined and stored preferences. 
What will it happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they pick up informations on my activities? - those users that worry seeing the informative monopoly of Google ask. 
In most of the cases the potential represented by the company is rather what can be fearful and not the remorse, the fear for the punishment, the yearning for the freedom or the rebellion against the power. 
However it is already a fact confirmed that they don't only conserve, but in justifiable cases they also give at third all the looked for expressions, in these cases there is not anything that it protects the personal rights of the internet users. 
The debated example in the last times was the action coordinated against the Brazilian pedófilos maybe, when Google gave the Brazilian government the informations of its page of Web, called Orkut, to identify to the pedófilos. 
On the other hand, the internet users that worry about the rights of people, in the month of May were alleviated when the company together with the EFF, organization for the defense of the electronic rights, demonstrated successfully before the tribunal that was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the sentence, he/she won't be been able to force Google, by means of none of the points of the constitution to give any type of information requested secretly by the FBI. 
(At the same time the federal government was able to get so pretext of reinforcing the law of protection of the childhood behind approved years, near fifty thousand addresses of Web and about a thousand looked for sentences, but without obtaining the lists of the individual users' search, neither neither the complete lists of pages Web and of key words of the last two months.) 
It is this way quite contradictory the opinion on the Google: they criticize it those that fear to give their personal data because they think that its intimacy, its private life is harmed when beginning to use the services of Google, and they rebel against her like against the multinational companies of conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the culture North American geek and their enthusiastic followers, internet users and users of other countries, they come in them the future generation, the corporation of vanguard", I didn't seize their rival, the Microsoft, classified by their Windows like conqueror of the World, no matter how much both fight for the same objective. 
This can happen because the Google on the contrary of the Microsoft, he/she doesn't request of the users any identification code, neither money for their applications, the code is open and the package of gratuitous program, constantly upgrade and it seems more juvenile, collaborating than the practice of the official giant of the software. 
But it can also be because the geek comes the existent very problematic relationship accurately among the rights of people and the Internet that he/she took place exactly for one of the key words more mentioned in the last years: the Web 2.0. 
The Web 2.0 are the collaboration, of to leave deliberate prints behind us and to take advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these it varies individually, the essence continues being the same one: to show us to ourselves. 
A normal youth can have profile in numerous collective pages, from Facebook until Xanga, and you/he/she can even unite them with other services, the Twitter or the last.fm that she offers list of their music customs, eat for example later to these you/he/she can include them in a pursuit system like the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, she can also have a blog, in which the most recent galleries of pictures that you/he/she is stored in the Flickr appear automatically or in the Picasa. 
We can know numerous cases of those that he/she comes off that for example the girlfriend, when seeing the flow of pictures of the following morning of the common friends, finds out you/he/she spent the previous night her fraudulent boyfriend with who or they can fire the employee of a company because this she writes her sincere opinion in her blog on the address of the company: a thing is safe, the definition of the private life revalued completely. 
The life on line of a person is what she shows of itself - this it is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our days. 
And the one that wants to hide something, or at least it seeks to avoid the monopoly of Google, he/she can make it (beginning for example with the Scroogle that uses the system of search of Google, but he/she doesn't leave prints). 
There are many people that don't want to register in the collective pages to avoid that they can find them, but the applications on line of Google can be replaced, from the software of writing of texts until the image applications and reading of news with alternative versions which are not connected with gigantic servants neither they prepare the possible more perfect profile on us. 
The opinion public wait almost that openly the day in that the Google shows its true face. 
The company with their current value of 156 thousand million dollars voucher more than the IBM (140 thousand million dollars), the Intel (124 thousand million dollars) or the Coca Cola (110 thousand million dollars), the surfaces of publicity of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the agencies of publicity, as long as the services that are introduced more and more quickly not only cause serious headaches for the Microsoft, but also to numerous other companies software developers. 
The critical observers however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example the superior address rejected the protest of the employees flatly after duplicating the price of the daycare center of the company, they considered too expensive the limitless number of the employees' feeding, but all this is not anything in comparison with the fact that in the year 2006 the Google gave before the Chinese government's pressure and the company according to the agreement it filtered all information that violated the good one moral and the interests of the Chinese régime. 
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they won't announce any new service in advance, but rather only when it was already clever to work, that that if it is safe it is that the foregone problems of next months and years they will be able to revolve to the World: while some believe that the escaneo project and file of books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the company soon will be mentioned by the Supreme Tribunal of the United States, others fear of its system Health, because in her we can create our own complete sanitary profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems. 
And the fact that Google will create a genetic database, he/she will be able to provide a good matter it prevails for the writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novelizes of the popular of Cory Doctorow, it describes in form orweliana that future, in the one which a man only of the data of the Google it can describe himself alarmingly well. 
Two smaller than age helped to erase the prints to the author of twice as much murder of the city of Ózd. 
The police interrogated at two smaller than age on twice as much murder of Ózd who, according to based suspicion, they helped to erase the prints of the crime - he/she said on Tuesday the spokesman of the General Police station of Public Order of the county of Borsod. 
The youths recognized the crime that was imputed them, and at the moment they are accused of instigators of the crime. 
The two minor - according to the informations of the Hungarian Agency of News it is two girls - they will be able to defend in freedom. 
For the complicity they can receive until with 5 years of jail. 
The accused of twice as much murder of Ózd - a 23 year-old man - it is in preventive detention from Sunday. 
He/she is accused the crime of murdering several people with forethought and for greed.

On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
The main European newspapers in their comments of Tuesday dedicated to the more and more deep international financial crisis speak of one second September 11." 
The global financial catastrophe owes to the North American president - The Republic of Rome says - the president has not been capable not even of getting the support of his own party for the bill made hastily whose objective is to give solution to this exasperating situation... 
Instead of a new Pearl Habor", of which the multimillionaire investor spoke to Warren Buffett, it is more correct to speak of one second September 11." 
According to a part of the press from Madrid, Washington is the expiatory male goat. 
In opinion of The World the error of the political address of the United States the one that took to the world economy on the edge of the abyss went. 
It grows more and more the danger of the crumbling of the North American monetary system and this then, will rebound in the whole world. 
Although the plan of Bush was not perfect, after the voting of the congress it arises the danger that Washington doesn't offer instrument politician to try to the crisis. 
The world economy is suspended in the air - exactly when it is carried out one of the biggest transformations in the history of the capitalism. 
One cannot pay remiss attention to this threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva points. 
Some states today they can still throw him lifeboat belt to the wobbly financial institutions, being able to save them that the crash with the money of the taxpayers. 
But if as I dominate them they still crumble more bank, then no longer they will be enough neither the new funds, neither neither the new improvisations. 
It is needed long term that the states members of the European Union leave to a side their nationalist selfishness and centralize the control on the broken into fragments financial markets. 
The financial institutions in crisis only received on Monday more than 100 thousand million Eurus - he/she reminds the vienés Standard Der, adding that they are more and more real the concerns that, just as they made the North Americans, the European taxpayers will also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis. 
The UE up to now has not been in charge of seriously with the crisis that goes as a cúname by the Old Continent. 
The " saviors " won't have to present hundred of millions of Eurus immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is he/she justified to use the funds of the taxpayers to avoid a not well bigger one? 
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
Which would the best method be to develop technologies with the purpose of avoiding collisions, if not the imitation of the sensors of existent obstacles in the nature? 
For example that of the bumblebees. 
In a surprising project presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the bumblebees gave the starting point for the engineers of Nissan to design the following generation of the system of prevention of the collisions. 
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the system of address robotics of automobiles type BR23C imitator of the nature, to which gave him the characteristics of the bumblebees, with the final objective of creating a system that can avoid all the collisions. 
During the flight each bumblebee believes his own space oval matter that in fact looks like each other a lot to our capsule protector of security - he explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and of development and investigations. 
They play an important part the eyes made up of the bumblebees that are able to see in all the addresses in a superior angle to 300 degrees. 
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the system of mensuration of the longitude for rays laser. 
This identifies the obstacles before the BR23C inside a distance of 2 meters, in an angle of 180 degrees, it calculates their distance and he/she sends a sign to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms in a maneuver to avoid the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, it modifies the address rotating in the necessary measure the wheels. 
Contrary to any existent system this maneuver is at the moment, completely instinctive. 
"If it was not this way, the robot of the vehicle could not react with the enough speed like to avoid the obstacles" - Toshiyuki explains to Andoh, boss of the Laboratory of Mobility and of the robot's of vehicles project. 
He/she should react immediately and in instinctive form, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable interior layer in the capsule protector of security, in a layer inside the one which at the moment are considered unavoidable all type of collisions. 
The whole process should reflect that he/she makes a bumblebee to avoid other bumblebees. 
This process should be carried out in a to open up and to close the eyes. 
However, contrary to the bumblebees, the movement cannot go up, down or diagonal, but it can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the address of turn of the wheels 
This way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here only used as possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and the acceleration also the frenaje. 
The BR23C uses lítio-polymer batteries that are slighter and it is bigger its energy density, what means that they have a duration of longer life that the one of lítio-ión. 
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the capacity of prosecution of the data, by no means that of storage. 
This apparatus in each second should only process some entrance signs and to react according to the case. 
It is not necessary to store these data neither to react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, it uses this way only by heart some dozens of kilobytes. 
They are not needed gigabytes memoirs, neither of megabytes. 
This is the first step to develop the technology to avoid the obstacles immediately, the one which according to calculations of the Nissan, in ten years he/she will be able to incorporate to the models manufactured in series. 
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit to the sailing system for via satellite GPS to take to the driver to its destination, avoiding the existent obstacles in its road. 
He/she already has name this expensive boy 
He/she has gotten ready the written version of the law of the package of financial rescue of 700 thousand million dollars that will be applied in several phases with the purpose of buying the bad credits of the banks. 
In the first phase he/she will wear out half of the money. 
According to schedule of the oriental coast during the new consultations that lasted until after the midnight of Saturday, the leaders of the congress reached an agreement around the package of financial rescue of 700 thousand million dollars in total, after several days of discussion - the Reuters informed. 
We have achieved an important progress - Nancy Pelosi said, democratic president of the North American Congress, affirming that it only lacks to formalize the agreement in a document. 
The commitment assumed on the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finances, talking about the result of the commitment affirmed: this program will work and it will be efficient but other measures are needed more. According to Pelosi, it is not to save the Wall Street, but of giving turn to the car of the economy. 
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is to say on Sunday before 8 in the night, according to schedule of Washington (that is to say before the two of the dawn of Monday, according to schedule of Central Europe), without it caused a spectacular jump in the bags. 
On the bill called emergency law for the economic stabilization of the year 2008, on first Monday he/she will vote the North American Congress and then the Senate. 
The president George W. Bush in the night of Saturday consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news on the agreement. 
We are happy with the progress reached during the night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties highly to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy - Tony declared Fratto, the spokesman of the White House. 
The program is different from the original proposal of the administration of Bush of spending all the 700 thousand million dollars to buy titles values of bottom of credit of bad quality. 
Now only he/she will be able to wear out half of the 700 thousand million dollars, using 250 thousand millions immediately after the Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finances will buy titles values of credit bottom, of bad qualification and the destination of other 100 thousand million dollars depends on the president's decision. 
This program will be controlled by a special organism, in which will also participate the president of the Federal Reservation. 
The other half of the 700 thousand million dollars will be able to wear out after a new decision of the Congress. 
According to the law the Ministry of Finances can apply a combined tactics: he/she will be able to buy bad credits, mortgages and titles values of credit bottom simultaneously, also other credits of poisonous type also. 
The purchase one will be able to make in auctions or in direct form - competent people of the ministry informed. 
The law allows to the affected companies to participate in a program of sure where the wallet of finances guarantees the elements preocupantes, for which will pay the companies the amount corresponding to the foregone damages. 
Henry Paulson affirmed: the law assures in such a way the necessary financial means that until they can even arrive 700 thousand million dollars to satisfy the urgent necessities of the North American financial system, be the purchase of bad financial means, of its insurance or of the prevention of risks that you/they could cause the crumbling of some big financial institutions. 
We make all the necessary one to be clever to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he/she added. 
On the other hand, the bosses of the banks that are in difficulties and they expect the help of the State they will be able to have the official limitation of their compensations that the North American jargon simply calls parachute of gold. 
Only in some certain cases the payments will be limited, the limitations also depend in the way of help of the ministry of finances. 
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the mark of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for the parachute of gold, unless the unsuccessful boss of the bank goes into retirement. 
When buying the bad credits directly the government it will intervene aggressively to assure that the compensations of the bosses are not exaggerated. 
Besides the above-mentioned they won't change the existent contracts of parachute of gold, the limitations only refer to the new contracts to stimulate the participation likewise in the program. 
This is the first case in the North American history that will be in validity a legal limitation for the revenues of the general directors - he/she commented this measure the democratic Barney Frank, president of the commission of the Congress, responsible for the financial services. 
The State will also be entitled of acquiring actions of the participant banks in the program, he/she will decrease this way the risk of the taxpayers, since in definitive they will be able to even to obtain earnings with the transaction as soon as he/she recovers the economy and with her the bank. 
According to the bill in next five years the president will present to the Congress a proposition on the form of how to return the taxpayers the losses of the financial sector. 
Of course in both sides there was who expressed their reservations with regard to the project. 
It is not this what the North American citizens commended us, that is to say the dollars of the taxpayers are not protecting - the republican congress member from California, Darrell declared Issa. 
Their democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur affirmed: the measures urged it the same ones that are responsible for the crumbling of the Wall Street.

Have of press of the area of German speech 
The right group is intact, only inside the own group the most conscious voters became - the Der affirms Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Baviera. 
Haider and their followers are clever to govern in Austria to impede a coalition rojinegro. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of left Franz Walter, in their titled article The Revolution of Baviera devours its parents it analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU. 
According to the well-known politólogo, the erosion of the CSU had begun a lot before the sad duet Beckstein-Huber had assumed its position. 
The socialcristianos during several decades went developing Baviera - and now these modern citizens are exactly those that give him the back. 
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian democracy, likewise of Angela Merkel. 
The failure was not completely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process ended that was already foreseen for almost ten years: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party disappeared. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47,7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent from the years fifty. 
This repeated three years ago, in the elections of the Bundestag 2005, that is to say still during the so mentioned era of Stoiber. 
The reason of it is it the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring county of their progenitors. 
The sociologists already 40 years ago come predicting this, but in the rhythm they made a mistake a lot. However, the secularización, the results of the education and the establishment of the Germans of the North in the developed regions of Baviera had their negative consequences about the fidelity of the voters of the CSU. 
With the modernization they are also increased equally the possibilities and it he/she has political consequences. 
The right group is intact, only inside the own group the most conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters became. 
It is surprising that in the last weeks the conventional groups of the citizens those that went away more than the CSU were exactly; the autonomous ones, the small ones industrial, those that have high school and the graduates. 
This way you recudió to less than 40 percent the support to the CSU. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: " Who with who? In their titled article The presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition questions" - he/she is in charge of of the internal politics's confused situation after the Austrian elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohíbe that the SPÖ interferes in its internal matters. 
The BZÖ is shown opened up in all the addresses to negotiate, the greens on the other hand don't still want to make consultations on the coalition. 
They already took place the elections, now everything rotates around the coalition; in the debate taken place in public television, the leaders of the parties hardly allowed to see something of their packs of cards. 
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that it is possible the collaboration among the two parties - this already exists in some counties and social associations. 
Fayman left slope the question that if it can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the vicecanciller position. 
He/she affirmed that in any event they disapproved the era of Schüssel-Molterer. 
It is not possible to follow this political tendency. 
Molterer reacted gingerly to the red offers. 
He/she said that it won't surely be successful the cooperation if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal matters of the ÖVP. 
It is still opened in the party if they will choose the opposition or they will enter in the coalition, these questions should be discussed without a doubt some, inside the own ÖVP. 
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider was shown opened up in all the addresses. 
"To impede the coalition red-quarter note, we are willing to assume the government's responsibility" - Haider affirmed. 
Járóka: It is necessary to break the vicious circle of the poverty and of the segregation 
Today he/she has begun in Paris the European Summit for the Equality of Opportunities, their host is France that this year is also president of shift of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, deputy of the European Popular Party for the Fidesz, in their message directed to the full one, like one of the main speakers of this professional encounter, got the attention about the segregation in the education, because it is one of the most serious violations that whip the gypsy children and it is also also the biggest obstacle before the prevale foundation of their interests. 
This conference of high level was inaugurated - on behalf of the French presidency - for Xavier Bertrand, French minister of employment and social matters and for Vladimir Spidla, responsible European commissary for the employments, social matters and of equality of opportunities. 
They attended the meeting representatives of the governments, European social speakers and representatives of the most important European organizations in protection of the social rights. 
Járóka - according to the desk of press of the group of deputies of the Fidesz in the European Parliament - he/she noticed that besides the discrimination in the employment, the gypsies are in the first place outside of the labor market for their low escolaridad level. 
"Most of the gypsy youths has not finished the secondary education and due to the bad quality of the basic teaching, an insignificant part can only obtain university diploma." 
Járóka also highlighted that the education, as fundamental human right, also has a decisive paper in the prevale foundation of the other human rights. 
The investment in the teaching of the gypsy children to an early age can strengthen the economy of the States members of the European Union. 
According to the eurodiputada, it is necessary to inform these questions thoroughly as much among the gypsies as among the non gypsies. 
Because while earlier the school begins a student gypsy, more possibilities he/she will have to become an active member of the labor market; through the taxes to the rent and of consumption they will also contribute to the national budget. 
"To the gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, it is necessary to assure them the right for an education of quality and to guarantee the abolition of the segregated education and of low level" - Lívia highlighted Járóka. 
According to the eurodiputada, it is necessary the objective and active unit of the European Union to accelerate the processes of school desegregation immediately, for that is of fundamental importance the correct execution of the directive existent and planned antidiscriminatorias. 
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of the poverty, the segregation and the unemployment, it is necessary to offer the gypsy children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute the future of Europe like citizens of full rights" - Járóka demanded. 
The objective of the European Summit for the organized Equality of Opportunities annually from the encounter from Berlin of the last year that he/she took place in the sign of the European Year of the Equality of Opportunities", it is to assure a singular forum to promote the abolition of the discrimination and the equality of opportunities at European level and national level of the States members. 
CSU: grace for a transitory period 
At the end of October he/she will take a decision about the luck of the unsuccessful duet Huber-Beckstein 
In spite of the serious electoral defeat, heads have not still been cut in the summits of the Bavarian CSU, at the moment the debate has been deferred on personal questions. 
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, first provincial minister still remains in his positions, but it is not known until when the grace will last. 
The luck of the duet that suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will decide in the extraordinary congress of the party that will take place the last weekend of October. 
The members of the so criticized duet allowed to see: they don't cling so much to their positions. 
With they sought to tranquilize it to the furious members of their parliamentary group and of their base organization who one day after the Bavarian tsunami demanded personal consequences due to the loss from most absolute. 
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber that was in the summit of their career - the union socialcristiana reached 60,7 percent, on the other hand now, one year after the blow crowded against Stoiber, they only got 43,4 percent. 
The CSU during 46 years had " monopoly " in Baviera that gives 18 percent of the German PBI. 
Although in the county of the South, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, the conservatives continue prevailing, in the future without a doubt will make coalition with somebody. 
As first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice-president Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of the possible successors of Huber, also has a position in the reduced intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and with the Voters Free of right on a possible government coalition in Munich. 
The strange of the destination is that in the list of the Free Voters that enters in the parliament Gabriele Pauli whose performance against Stoiber was taken advantage of for the blow of the duet Huber-Beckstein and then they erased cruelly from the scenario to the local political ambitious person. 
The directing maxima of the CSU are investing all their energy now to stabilize Beckstein. 
In the transition he/she will also receive an active paper Stoiber that up to now it was moving the strings in the bottom, the former-boss of government provincial and old president of the CSU qualified September 28 like the most bitter day in his political career. 
On Monday Huber made some critical observations to the CDU, in its opinion they had deserved much more support of the party brother. 
Other politicians of the CSU interpreted the defeat like a warning for the CDU and for the own Angela Merkel also. 
After the elections of September of 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel won't be able to be a chancellor if they are not able to enhance the CSU that played a momentous part in the successes of the national elections of 2005 together. 
According to Merkel that with great difficulty could hide their deception for the failure, the losses of the CSU won't rebound negatively on the great coalition from Berlin. 
That which naturally is relative: it won't be easier to try to the wounded CSU and the crisis of the continuous socialdemócratas. 
The SPD with 18,6 percent reached its worst result from 1946 in Baviera. 
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0 
After the elections of Sunday, there won't be any deputy opponent in the parliament bielorruso. 
According to the Russian observers, this is explained on the other hand with the well-being and the stability that it guarantees in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, according to the Organization for the Security and the Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather with the violations of the law made during the count of the votes. 
The OSCE that sent 450 observers coming from 43 countries, didn't recognize the electoral result. 
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated percent and ten deputies, he/she makes more than a decade he/she doesn't have opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) he/she waited that Lukashenko that renovated their command after the elections of 2006 of doubtful genuineness for fourth time, for consequence of the modification of the Constitution this time it would allow the entrance of some deputies of the opposition in the parliament. 
The ODSZ suppressed this way the boycott that originally wanted to make. 
The one was in the bottom of the expectations of the opposition that Bielorrusia that every time depends more economically on Russia - that took a credit to moderate the more and more expensive import of natural gas of Russia and that it contributed for sale Russia of the Beltransgaz, proprietor of the gasoducto that goes by the country - he/she wanted to improve its relationships with the European Union that doesn't give entrance permission to Lukashenko and the other politicians of high level to have an antidemocrat considered political régime. 
It was a distension sign when the OSCE, when evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis rather on the positive phenomena and don't have more than enough the errors - I eat the prohibition for example of participating tax to a third of the candidates of the opposition. 
However the primary report of Monday of the OSCE even criticized the own campaign - in which the candidates of the opposition could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the count of the votes. 
With all this in opinion of the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: they were in freedom the political prisoners and Minsk it is willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of Osetia of the South and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with the one which Bielorrusia theoretically constitutes a federal State - it has considered the two regions already for one month like independent. 
- We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Bielorrusia and the European Union - he/she declared our periodic Alexandr Milinkevich. 
According to the candidate of the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006 it is desirable to maintain this situation, although the régime fears to allow the entrance of so at least an opponent in that parliament without weight." 
The opposition doesn't plan to organize protest manifestations when seeing the results, rather he/she tries to make arrive to the voters its message about the necessity of making economic reformations. 
- This clear it causes us many problems because we should print the press of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but I even see this way that every time they are more those that support the change among those bigger than age also - Milinkevich said, making allusion to that you/they don't consider it to the régime of Lukashenko that believes that its main result is the creation of the social security, not even adapted the pensioners, those that officially are those more subsidized by the régime. 
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the commercial deficit, it is only question of time the decomposition of the social security that resembles the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said. 
The Russian observers on the contrary of the politician of the opposition they qualified of democratic to the elections. 
Serguei Lebedev, boss of the mission of the Independent Community of States declared to the Russian agency of news Novosti he Laughs: "people don't believe in the words but in the facts", so that the lack of the opposition is not another thing that the testimony of the maturity of the electing bielorrusos. 
Brunetta: "Of now in more he/she has breakfast before beginning to work" 
It has never happened in Palacio's History Chigi that put automatic doors to control the entrance and the personnel's exit. 
but from today he/she begins with this measure against who registers and later he/she leaves to the bar to take a coffee in schedule of work. 
This novelty has been presented today by the minister of the Administration it Publishes, Renato Brunetta and for the general secretary of the presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The automatic doors - Brunetta says - they are an instrument to work better, with bigger productivity, more presence and more services the minister specifies. 
"Now a new season of responsibility opens up and of transparency. 
This is Reformismo", he/she underlines Brunetta again. 
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council. 
For Masi the election of the automatic doors is important also from the symbolic point of view." 
He/she has not been resistance on the part of the employees, the general secretary assures: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was the collaboration on behalf of the same ones." 
In definitive, not more breakfast in schedule of work; not browner and medialunas. 
Word of Brunetta that suggests, smiling, a good capuchino at 7 in the morning is a sacred hand." 
During a convention in the Superior school of the Public Administration 
of Rome, the minister declares that in three months the absences for the public employees' illnesses have been reduced of 50%, he means 60 thousand more people to the work in one year." 
And he/she adds that it is necessary to surrender more effective the Public Administration 
Italian, those which dynamic salary? does the minister explain? in the last 8-10 years they have been double regarding the private sector and good for up of the I appraise of inflation." 
For the time being millions of employees publics have united to be opposed to the norms of the ordinance Brunetta sticking to the petition supported by the Codacons. 
"While the minister of the Function Public sample the numbers, the smallest work absenteeism for illness causes? does he/she write the consumadores association? the town of those ' hard-working vagos' is in continuous increase. 
They are indeed millions in Italy the employees of the correct and productive public administration that have united to declare war to the norms you illegitimate of the ordinance." 
In particular, in the Tar the exclusion of economic treatments was answered added by due illness because of service; the extension of the strips horarias in which are carried out the visits of the sick employee's medical control, and other contained aspects in the new dispositions wanted by the minister. 
Have an accident of work, Neapolitan: "Crucial prevention" 
Every day, in Italy, they are verified in the work 2.500 accidents, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid. 
For the 2007, the data Inail confirms indeed that the white deaths have been approximately 1.200. 
Figures that you/they testify the graveness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and it almost causes double deads regarding the homicides. 
To call the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic question, today the Anmil takes place in all the counties of Italy the 58° national day for the victims of the work accidents, institutionalized in second Sunday of October. 
"The preocupantes data diffused by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm as much as crucial it is the question of the prevention in the work", the president of the Republic affirms Neapolitan Giorgio, in the message sent the president of the Anmil, mutilated national Association and invalids by the work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The boss of the State squeezes his great appreciation for the constant associative zeal in favor of the prevention in the work place, of the protection of the injured workers, of the attendance to the families of the victims and of the sensitization of the public opinion." 
"He/she has shown, a ' basta', sincerely shared, in front to tragedies that, for their dimensions, they raise the clamor of the means and the participation of the public opinion, on the other hand the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics." 
Neapolitan doesn't hide that there are without doubts a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in formation and in information. 
Matter meaning takes the numerous initiatives promoted in school environment for a more direct one taking of conscience on behalf of the youths that enter in the world of the work. 
It is a duty to maintain alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to brake the alarm about the social graveness, to apply and to improve the norms legislativas. 
On the other hand the president of the Camera Gianfranco Fini has underlined as the phenomenon of the white deaths they constitute an absolute social emergency that offends the conscience of each one of us and it imposes to all the institutions a resolved zeal to put an end urgently." 
"The data on the accidents in the work seem to point out a slight positive andamiento, but this doesn't remove that the number of the white deaths is equally impressive", the president of the Anmil has stressed Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We don't want, indeed that this tendency to the decrease is translated in less attention, because it is exactly when the attention diminishes that it exploits the tragedy. 
"We believe that at general level it is still made too little to contrast the phenomenon of the accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions. 
Are they necessary, to our approach - has Mercandelli stood out? bigger controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the formation of the workers, and this starting from the world of the school." 
"It serves an ulterior effort - he/she has added - since it concerns the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion. 
But it serves, overalls, a bigger sense of responsibility on behalf of the employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency." 
Mercandelli has denounced the progressive deterioration of the level of it guides subsidiary foreseen for the victims of the work and the assistance derivation toward which the system is going in the last years." 
"Is the objective to restore the worker the guarantee of the insurance - has he/she added? because the luck of who has an accident doesn't have to depend on the gift prepared by the legislator every time." 
Readers Mp3 under it accuses, they put to risk the audition 
To listen music to high volume for one period long time using portable musical apparatuses as the readers Mp3 can cause permanent lesions to the audition. 
It is as much as he/she refers the European Commission that mentions the opinion of the Scientific Commission of the emergent and recently identified sanitary risk in an official statement diffused in Bruxel (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today. 
"Of this scientific opinion? is it read in the note? it arises that 5-10% of those that, for an at least 5 year-old period, they listen music weekly with portable musical apparatuses for more than one hour a day having the apparatus to high volume takes a risk a lost one permanent of the auditory capacity." 
"I worry about the fact that a number this way high of youths that frequently use portable musical apparatuses and cellular telephones at high acoustic level they can ruin their hearings unconsciously in hopeless way", Meglena affirms Kuneva. 
"Of the scientific tests? it follows the responsibility Ue - a clear risk emerges and we should react quickly. 
What counts, is to sensitize to the consumadores and to surrender this information of public domain. 
We owe re to examine, also the existent control systems by the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and have the step with the new technology." 
Bruxel had requested To the Independent Scientific Committee of examining the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical apparatuses and the increase from the number of exposed youths to the noise that that originates. 
"The scientists - does the executive Ue conclude? they confirm that it is reason of concern and the European Commission now will examine together with to the states members and the interested parts that measured you possibly could adopt to protect the children and the adolescents better from the exhibition to the noise coming from portable musical apparatuses and apparatuses you tune." 
At the moment, a norm of European security that limits to 100 dB the level of noise of the portable musical apparatuses, already exists but concern increases as the auditory damage that can derive from an excessive exhibition to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit of a lot these damages appealing to solutions as the reduction of levels and of the time of exhibition to the noise. 
To their view, The Scientific Committee Ue makes present that you the utilizadores of portable musical apparatuses listens to high volume (but of 89 decibeles)música for single 5 hours a week overcome the limit at the moment in relative vigor to the maximum noise consented in the work position. 
Those that listen music under such conditions per periods but lingering, they take a risk a lost one permanent of the auditory capacity after a 5 year-old period. 
It means that it affects 5-10% of the utilizadores of such apparatuses and the one numbers it can be quantified between 2,5 and 10 million people in the Ue. 
Rome, Alemanno gives the via to the Commission for the future of the capital 
Today he/she begins, in March he/she closes, in June the bills will be made. 
It is this the calendar fixed by the Municipality and for the workers of the Commission for the fututo of the capital of Rome" that this morning it has been established in their new headquarters behind the Thermal baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission deliberated the main points for Rome. 
Once closed the doors in March, the meeting and the communal advice evaluated analysis and projects, in way of presenting in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the official bun of the Municipality and of their intendant Gianni Alemanno. 
"Is the Commission absolutely independent and is it represented by all the political, social and cultural ideas? does he/she spread to underline Alemanno? It will provide proposals for the development of Rome in the one which those that decide politically, the meeting and the municipal advice, later they will be been able to endorse. 
There is not any excess position of lists, alone the will of taking a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome. 
In finished March the works will disappear, because this experience should have an it finishes precise storm. 
In June? does the intendant announce? we will present the strategic plan using the work made of the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome." 
To who accuses the Commission of useless, since their verdicts are not vinculantes, Alemanno responds: "Everything depends on the work that will be in degree of carrying out the Commission and of the quality of their proposals. 
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as well as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental. 
The politics is almost always flattened in the ordinary administration and in emergencies that of turn in turn are manifested.. 
We, on the contrary, want to look but there and long term, in a prospective but deep, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and their future." 
The intendant from Rome spreads to also point out that this Commission is not neither an useless entity neither a banality: it is absolutely free, not coastal an euro to the Roman citizens and it will be good to make to participate and to reason the best minds that it squeezes the capital." 
For Alemanno, indeed, it is needed to have a strategic design as reference, not closed neither immobile, to allow to our city to make an I authenticate level jump, of which have absolute necessity, thinking with unitary spirit to their future." 
A future that, precise the intendant from Rome was not limited alone to the current communal confines but rather he looked but there not alone in the optics of the future metropolitan city and of his juridical state of Capital but also considering the list that Rome can and it should unwrap as Capital of Europe and of the Mediterranean." 
Obama? The first president anti American. 
He/she has written an American politician that interests him to pass for independent notice: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first one was Jimmy Crankcase that reduced the economy with their decisions it USES and tube relationships (like he/she has given civic also for today private) with the enemy Islam." 
The attacks increase against Obama while he/she comes closer the date of the elections. 
a lady from Miami has written in a Web: "This person is full with ambitions. 
Obama has a great stone face: he/she believes that it won the position but high of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators"!. 
In fact they are attacks that you/they don't say a lot; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and they don't respond to the question of the voters: will a good president be? And the polls are also; all say that Obama won and with a good advantage. 
Also in this case it exists who speaks with the heart but not with the brain. 
A newspaper of the Mississippi, in the bowel of the south of the United States, he/she has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote will taste well like who will give their vote the American patriot. 
It leaves a side of the mentality American had cover until the last one. 
"Say what you/they want, we will think us later to where to put the cross, if Obama has more than enough or on McCain." 
There are people that swears: if it ends up winning Obama, we will leave America. 
never sew this before now that seems almost certain the black candidate's success. 
However in spite of, all these reasonings, the conquering weapon for the democratic ones is George Bush. 
They have requested to 1500 people: which have the errors been made by Bush during their command? 89 percent has answered: Iraq. 
America changes. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and they sent it to house to kicks in the bottom. 
In Iraq they are 4500 the soldiers that have lost the life and the Americans have not been forced to make the valises. 
Equally, Iraq for most has been the weak point of Bush. 
Who will assume the position of George W he/she will have an enormous duty that to unwrap. 
It uses, the economic collapse is made also feel for the journalists: in the newspapers it is time of courts. Many give the blame to Internet, he/she murders of the printed paper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been interpellated by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and of mental control for the future. 
Although, today the journalists are almost all pessimists on their future. 
However, the journalists have not declared openly to feel less concerned about the credibility. 
They don't feel isolated as once. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money, the money. 
The crisis of the 2008 for these journalists is destroyed economic model's crisis. 
Also the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper, it is a great problem. 
It is a problem that should be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if one doesn't want that the traditional journalism as he/she understands it most of the public he/she decreases substantially. 
A clearing but complex pessimism prevails today on the American journalist. 
Six on ten journalists and executives are convinced that the journalism at national level this following a mistaken road. 
In the local field the executive group is 65%. 
Form against emission. 
It is not difficult for the journalists to see where the web goes. 
The biggest houses editorials open up a breach in Internet, for many view as the murderer of the printed letter. 
The economic pressure that the journalists notice has increased until 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are hugging the technology in the hope that makes something of good for the journalism. 
The break but big today in the American journalism is among who directs the newspapers? that is to say the directors? and the journalists that work for them. 
56% of the executives at national level is for sure its journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage one low to 23%. 
For some this has to do with the security of the work." 
The executives that plan to lose the work position in 3 years are 47% at national level. 
For the journalistic staff it is of 30%. 
That of the sure work at level staff (our editors, ndr) in America it is always to the agenda. 
Only the 13% of the journalists works with a contract. 
In an immense nation as the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet the employers often offer what you/they want and he/she becomes this way a question of you take it or leave it". 
The directors almost always receive good wages, while the editors can win up to 10 thousand dollars a month, but the jubilation and the social insurance. 
For the vacations, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to arrive to 15 complete days after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists, for his admission, get sick followed during the year. 
It is an entire climate question. 
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL BLUNT DE, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second penal section of the tribunal of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, he/she has decided to reject the instance of the real state Danilo Coppola that had asked to be able to move of their city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola this investigated by bankruptcy in the environment of the investigation on the one against relative pact to the escalade Unipol-Bnl. 
In the course of the arrest process to their position, last week, he/she has obtained the domiciliary liberation, transforming it in obligatory residence to Grottaferrata. 
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, they had asked that the real state one can travel the route of the city of the county until a room of the capital. 
According to the tribunal, these trips (for which the pm has given contrary vote) they would allow him to influence its society and to consent to the tests that accuse him. 
The elites in danger 
The phenomenon had already shown behind some days with the vote of the camera of the representatives against the plan of salvation of 700 million dollars started by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, but interested to punish Wall Street that to save the economy. 
He/she gives us one the New York yesterday Times it confirms informing us that the crisis in course is dismantling the Republican party, always but divided among its old soul of the Costa This, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile a"aquellos of Washington» and to the world of the finances, strong overalls in the states of the Center and of the South. 
The soul, in fact that has become prepotente with the vote of who spoke at the beginning. 
This grieves mentioned it is alone an example of the mutations, of the big mutations that the economic earthquake in course announces: not alone in the United States but in all the West and not alone here only. 
Be in the United States like in Europe the crisis seems for some time to work as accelerator of incubation phenomena that solidify with the new climate and they leave to the light. 
The first of these phenomena is the re upgrade, the extraordinary reactivación, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re nationalization of the economy. 
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of bank institutions - it would finance which have, if, strong relationships would finance with the exterior, but overalls they are committed much more the balances of the families that you/they live in an only country and in an only state. 
The one that believes a political problem immediately for who governs it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulty and the protests of those people and of those families that, on the other hand they are electing. 
The crisis appears economically world but it is politically and exclusively national. 
The political internationalism seems substantially outside of game or they don't have a lot to say: the crucial test is The European Union that divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies he/she doesn't reach to decide any politics in common. 
It belongs to the government of each state that all are expected an intervention, rescue plans and of reactivación, of new rules and overalls the grant of funds: from the moment that you arrives to the cut it is alone the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources to finance you to remedy the things. 
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two resources of incalculable value, value in certain circumstances in the one which any market probably and no organization will never be able to prepare in the same measure. 
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect syntony, with the biggest importance whenever the new development of the economy spreads to attribute to a factor very associated to that element: the territorialidad. 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced of having always entered in the net of the technology but sophisticated, of the immaterial one, while we were convinced that the global finance was already dedicated to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have on the other hand to make the bills every time but with the not very immaterial things as the water, the cultivations and the petroleum. 
All things that, notice, they can be certainly transported of a place to the other of the earth but they are equally united in absolute way in a bounded space, a territory. 
So who is as sovereign, it possesses certainly many but letters regarding who is not it, and to who has the misfortune of living in a position without cultivations, without petroleum and without water. 
I arrive to the second novelty that but it denounces a fracture. 
Who tells Territory, State, Government, inevitably he/she says Politics and Leadership. 
In this sense the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena. 
On one hand the objective conscience of the necessity of a leadership, the petition of some that knows how to take in hand the situation. 
On the other hand a bad reputation wave for the existent leaderships, of inadequate raised economic species with many dark areas. 
And together something but deep and in a certain disturbing sense: a bad reputation, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance that spreads to imply the whole directing class of the countries of the West in a growing number. 
It seems to always advance more, in the population's diverse places, the conviction that before their actions are the same ones that those of the social elites up to now in peak, the same way of feeling and of being, its culture in the understanding exception of the one finishes, to have made the own time and to be but I miss to the opinions of most. 
The demand of leadership, in few words, feeds a ramified movement undergroundly but potent of deslegitimación of the directing classes and of the traditional political structures that are manifested in una"revuelta» electoral or in the sudden changes of collective humors of these last times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consent in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and you also castrate with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to see). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their credited intellectuals, their format would say some, always make more difficulty to understand and then to represent, that that you/they are the deep strata of the western society from today that he/she is taking form and that the economic crisis renovates, it increases and it shakes potentially in limitless. 
Of in front of all this to speak of una"rebelión of masses» today in day is frankly exaggerated. 
But to have the open eyes certainly is not it. 
The súper paste to walk on the walls 
To conquer the laws of graveness thanks to a súper paste and in a future to walk on the walls like the man claws. 
It is the objective of several American investigation centers and now a team of four institutes has come closer enough. 
With an adhesive of single 2,5 square centimeters the scientists have been able to have hit a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall. 
THE STUDY? The magazine American Science has published the discoveries of some investigators of the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and of the Air I Forced Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of investigators is an evolution of the existent ones that you/they use a structure peculiar of the carbon, called nanotubos of carbon. 
«The principle of the paste can be imagined as a series of orderly tubes as a spaghetti pile» Zhong explains to Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta. 
The scientists have been inspired to the paw of the gecos, recovered of microscopic hair that can assure to the animal a perfect adherence. 
The test made on different materials, as the glass, teflón and sandpaper paper, they have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times but potent of the paws of this reptile and to the same tiempo"se it takes easily off the walls» Liming explains to Dai, investigator of it authorizes her of Engineering of the University of Dayton. 
TO WALK FOR THE WALLS? - This material could be useful as transitory adhesive» Liming adds Dai. 
Do layers to walk exactly for the walls as the man claw? You castrate yes, but the investigators think to a much less fascinating use as the connection among electronic apparatuses, because the nanotubos of carbon is conductive of heat and of electric current. 
Other applications could have to do with the aerospace engineering. 
At the moment anything of superhéroes. 
ANOTHER INVESTIGATION - Also the University of Berkeley, in California, he/she is being devoted to the search of a new adhesive. 
In an article of the magazine American Chemical Society, the Californian specialists have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers like hair that you car cleans of the powder during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence. 
Fármacos: never with fruit juice 
Attention to the grapefruit juice, to that of orange and that of apple. 
These drinks, consummated mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if they take contemporarily with some fármacos he/she loses temper their absorption amplifying or diminishing according to the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for the health. 
To repeat the risk of the juices of fruits they are packed that fresh associated to the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London that from the 236esimo national meeting of American Chemical Society in course to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: coarse a glass of grapefruit juice, of orange and of apple to reduce the absorbimiento of some fármacos, annulling the beneficent effects and putting to risk the health of the patients. 
The grapefruit juice was been already under it accuses because it was retained responsible for increasing at toxic levels some medicinal arrhythmic anti, antibiotics, ansiolíticos, antihistamínicos and neurological. 
FARMACOS TO RISKS? The same Italian agency of the fármaco had given the news in a bulletin of informations two years behind alarming doctors and patient to not underestimating the danger that derived of this it mixes and to put attention to thing he/she drinks in the case a fármaco it is assuming like for example the one to Diasepam or the Metadone. 
NOT ALONE THE GRAPEFRUIT? According to the experts also the orange juice and that of apple contains substances that inhibit the fármacos. 
A long list of the active principles inhibited by the grapefruit and other juices. 
Of here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the state University of Kite: These discoveries in general come signal to the several agencies of the international and national fármaco that possibly provide to change the informative notes of the same one. 
For that reason it is necessary to always read the illustrative pamphlets of the medicinal ones that are assumed and if there is something that we don't have left clear, not to allow us to impress, to ask to the doctor or the pharmacist clearly» the expert of the agency underlined Ansa. 
The Beginner one of economy to Paul Krugman 
The prize nobel of economy has been assigned the American Paul Krugman for its studies, its trade models and on the localization of the economic activities. 
Krugman, 55 years, it is a keynesian neo that he/she teaches to the University of Princeton and it is an I notice editorialista of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics in the decisions of the administration of Bush as for the economy and to the foreign policy. 
Few months after the attack of September 11 the 2001, in those days che Enron, Krugman broke it had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the serious but decisive second event that the first one, in you finish of consequence for the United States. 
A forecast that I unchain a lot of polemic and that for several years he/she came reproached to the economy, but that now it has been revealed exact. 
«I am surprised and a little annoying for as the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and of Worldcom they have disappeared quickly of the public's attention», Krugman had declared to it dies her of the 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central banking, Krugman is un"economista of great value», but also an utterer with an aggressive estilo"muy, particularly critical against the excesses of the liberalism of the administration of Bush». 
Open Office, echo the third edition of the paquete"anti-Microsoft» 
It is the day of the launching of the OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that he/she looks to always attract but utilizadores, from the house to the office to the profesionistas of the public administration, as gratuitous alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost one year on behalf of the voluntary developers, of which their backs are watched over by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the interface it has less rude, they are added other but consistent, as the compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac YOU X and the support for the new format ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2,la finish standard version ISO. 
On attention also to the multi operation with the suite Office 2007, Open Office is in degree of opening the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting some functions specify of some modules like that that it allows to reduce the dimension of the presentation of PowerPoint, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility of caring the file PDF in the I modulate of graphic elaboration, conserving the original aspect of it paginates it. 
Always on this front documents hybrid PDF can be created" that accumulate the typical graph of the format of Adobe with the elements of a calculation leaf or of an elaborating of text. 
The Collaboration is an element that he/she has received different improvements inside the aplicativos: in the calculation leaf they can intervene in diverse users, avoiding the conflicts of you modify them, in the elaboration of texts, to each collaborator he/she comes given a color in the I comment for a better recognition in the revision phase. 
Some companies working to take some functions from OpenOffice to the Web are also (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in next weeks they should give the definitive result. 
The version in Italian you can discharge in the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and one adds to English that was in the mirror from Friday. 
Also that it stops Windows and Mac YOU, as the suite it is usually also available for the operating system Linux. 
To order it can also be sent the installation cd to house or the work. 
And if the topic of the gratuitous one can be a hook for the diffusion in the houses, it is in environment business that Open Office the suite proves, he/she attempts the big bet, already being able to have several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools. 
And they don't not even lack the realities that offer a formation service, consultations and of ideal attendance for the small and medium companies, in those that could open up prospective of business. 
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video notarizes the corresponding of Word; Calc, is the calculation leaf that Excel substitutes; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the well-known Access it is the program that consents to work in the one it dates base; and for I finish Draw the I modulate graph. 
Objective for the 2008 is of arriving to 5 million download, and considering that until today we arrive to almost already 3 millions 600 thousand, with the exit of the new version are probable that you can overcome the foreseen figure. 
Kohl is also positive it is the fourth case of doping 
New positive case in the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third classified and the climber's better rower's winner. 
To give the news it is the place of the periodic L'Equipe. 
Kohl, 26 years it is the fourth positive corridor to the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also them of the Gerolsteiner. 
The analyses of the champions of blood of Kohl enter among those made in the last weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If those against tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third position to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification. 
To confirm the news of the positive doping from Kohl to the Epo of third generation he/she is the boss of the agency French antidoping, Pierre Bordry that has declared the Associated Press of having notified the news to the Austrian authorities. 
The 26 year-old Austrian has been positioned in the podium to the Spanish Carlos' backs Sastre and of the American Cadel Evans, being awarded the best climber's rower. 
INMIGRANTES:NEW YORK CHEATS HE/SHE WONDERS, IS ITALY RACIST? 
Italy of emigrant's country has transformed alone recently in a privileged destination for the immigrants welcomed with hostility. 
Is this transforming the beautiful country in a nation of racists? It is what the New York Times wonders in a long article that he/she has dedicated to the debate on the topic racism in Italy leaving of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre native of Burkina murdered Faso the previous month in Milan to have stolen a box of cookies. 
This case evidences what the New York Times defines the paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where they register but integration and but I work but also the but anti-immigrant high feeling of the country and the one supports but high of the North league." 
As it confirms of the growing tension among Italian and immigrants the New York Times has also mentioned the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not alone. 
Also the new legislation wanted for it Bequeaths it it presses the control on the immigration and it facilitates the expulsion of the secret ones it is mentioned as paradigm of the cambiamiento of the climate in Italy. 
Marked tendency is for the Pope that for the president of the Republic: "Neapolitan Giorgio finding XVI Benedetto in the Congress has asked that the State and the church work together to combat the racism." 
Students kill of the expensive rent, up to 900 Eurus for a room 
The market of the rents for the university students doesn't know the crisis. 
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the union of the tenants, to rent an individual room could cost a student 900 Eurus in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome. 
"has the phenomenon already assumed characteristic very serious until the point of excluding the right to study to a great part of young for the high costs that the family would have to sustain? does he/she explain the responsible for the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani? in these cities the strong demand has deformed the market totally to such a point of unchaining a process of widespread increase until for the residents." 
To part that in most of the cases the offers of rents contain a series of violations: contracts free type, not registered, without canon limit, sub linked rents. 
For Sunia they are necessary extraordinary interventions that, through the revision of the fiscal imposition, the prices can be regulated. 
Looking in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in area Brianza, serves 450 Eurus approximately; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (area Bande Nere) to a half value of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine and Wild animal) to a maximum of 900 (in area Victoria). 
In Florence a bed costs in stocking of 350/400 Eurus, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where the students concentrate on the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 Eurus for a bed in a double room and of 370 at 500 for a singular. 
In Rome in the central areas near the Universidad(San Lorenzo, Square Bologna) they request you approximately 600 Eurus for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room. 
Single values lightly but first floor (550 Eurus for an individual room) in areas near other Universidades(Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
Economy is only made if outlying area is changed: 300 Eurus for a bed and 450 for an individual room in area Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings. 
In Naples for a bed serve you 300/450 Eurus, for a room he/she wears out from 400 to 600 Eurus, with the prices but high in the areas Policlínico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari for a bed serve you 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a singular. 
in the cities but small the prices are but first floor in you finish absolute, but he/she has a bigger weight in the economy of the city. 
In the cities like in Perugia, where the phenomenon of the rents to students and extracomunitarios is but it frequents, he/she registers an ulterior anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to the foreign students regarding the Italians. 
Good-bye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historical rooms 
The historical film rooms close favoring the Multiplex. 
"A city without film rooms in a blind city, is like a face without eyes." 
The image offered by the managing Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with efficiently what is happening in the big Italian urban centers and also in the county cities. 
The process of marginalización of the cinemas that with the birth of the big meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in the central areas of the city, it is an unavoidable and unquestionable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime. 
To disappear they are almost always by heart historical, full places, it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with the one died which was shared a place piece and so much emotion», the director of the new cinema Observes Paradiso, the movie that twenty years ago behind win the cousin Oscar and the great prize from the jury to Cannes that counted the poetry of a room of county cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that lost perhaps forever. 
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of the merchants, they speak clear: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most they are overalls the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turín and 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions but suffered by the closings they are as first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 less cinemas, continuing for Toscana (44) and Lombardía (41). 
It is a demonstration that the responsible for their disappearance is the agreement of the multiplex, they are own these three Italian regions that have made register the biggest number of new cinemas meticones: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 are in Toscana that in Emilia-Romaña. 
«The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally» Paolo observes Protti, president of the Anec, would be useful that new structures were built but it would be needed to already guarantee the permanency of those existent, because when a city room closes, not all their frequenters are willing to be transferred to the meticones. 
For not speaking of the lack of funds in favor of the merchants: the debt previous of the state is of approximately 10 million Eurus. 
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government doesn't respect the laws that exist. 
To sustain the sector it would serve between 16 and 18 million Eurus a year». 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried by the closings, he/she decided to be repaired with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and to guide the cinema monkey salts it is in the historical center that in the periphery. 
Among the foreseen norms they exist half-filled of fiscal facilitation in favor of the agents and advantages for the public in you finish of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter in the area of I traffic limited and they will have special rates for the parking. 
«It is an initiative that I like» Giuseppe observes Tornatore"y I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna putting in foot other measures. 
It is certain that stops it contrasts the extra to be able to of the meticones, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and of the image because the public today is but demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that for me it was always important: the closing of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, the spark that convinced me to carry out the New cinema Paradiso were" that already thought for 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I happen for before to the Rialto or the Quirinale of via Nazionale already closed where have lived so many shared emotions, for not seeing the posters blackened by the powder, I rotate myself for the other side». 
I rope among politics and ' ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia has been arrested Taurus 
"The mayor of Gioia Taurus was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for the interested ones to the cosca Piromalli." 
They are weighed you accuse them that the magistrates of the Address antimafia of Calabria give the intendant and the vice intendant of Goia Taurus Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafioso association. 
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator among the clan and the public administration, and their pled grandson, homonym of the boss, already condemned by mafioso criminal association and to reimburse 10 million Eurus. 
"Rejecting any artificial and moral norm, and of good sense", the procurators write, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to the lawyer Piromalli. 
"Would it have been allowed to the mafioso family? the judges write - of entering to the intern of the municipality officially facilitating the great possibility of the control and of command of the public administration." 
The president of the Calabrian regional meeting Agazio Loiero doesn't hide that agreements among the bad organized life are a heap in its region: "There are areas where the mafioso intensity is but strong that in other, where the agreement is almost unavoidable. 
But there are so many local politicians that resist to the pressure of the ' ndrangheta, heroes that he/she stays clean." 
Those arrested of this morning they are added those of the last Julio after the police had announced the cut of heads of the mafioso family Piromalli. 
From the ends of last April, the municipal advice of Gioia Taurus had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always for presumed condicionamientos between the organized crime rate and the local administration, the local politicians had been solevados of the responsibility of administering the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendant, of the Udc to the moment of the breakup, after the balotaje to May of the 2006, it had been elect as boss of a coalition of center right. 
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the breakup of the municipal advice. 
I call in cause to the vice minister of the interior that was Marco Minniti in that time, accusing him of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the signed arrest order this morning they explain that Piromalli until he/she had ended up requesting the variation of the project of the highway A3. 
Of the interceptions ambiéntales made Dal Torrione, the judges write, the readiness emerges to favor the demands of a manager, representative of a very near group to the clan Piromalli, standardizing the elections of the public administration about the interests of the mafioso families." 
When the energy is born of the waves, they go down to the scenario the big ones 
It is an exterminated location that it occupies but of 70% of the surface of the planet and they are discovering it now, the big world companies of the energy. 
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which look at the big ones as Chevron. 
The possibility to collect energy of the movements of the sea is studied for a hundred years and in the years 70 together with the first oil crisis, the investigations were intensified. 
When the price of the low petroleum, in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of the marine energy was remote, but now that the cases of environment and the new increase of the petroleum give impulse to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London it has estimated for the 2007 that 15 percent of the necessity electric World cup could be covered for you implant that they exploit the movement of the waves of the sea. 
This quantity would be double the one taken place at the moment by the nuclear power stations. 
And the currents and the tides would be also. 
Giants to the attack. 
The first company to bet on the marine energy has been Enersis that the 2005 have sealed an agreement to build an it implants in the North of Portugal. 
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step. 
To two years of distance to bet on the marine energy are always but and among these companies those that have always voted for the traditional energy. 
"Is Chevron studying the technology on the oceanic energy? has he/she declared the spokesman of a company associated to the one there is to the American oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal? and it is evaluating the possibility to cooperate with us." 
The cooperation in question is on the obtaining of a permission of the commission for the American energy, to carry out a project to exploit the marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a quite important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the USA continues to extract petroleum and recently the president Bush has activated a plan to carry out new perforations. 
Besides Chevron it is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the one on the way to the energy that comes from the sea, the total invested up to now, although they are not detailed they indicate an interest in increase. 
Technology to develop. 
The experts still speak from a technology to the beginning, because the marine energy is not doubts that he/she has a great environmental impact. 
For the time being the impacts like those Portuguese or the Scotsmen are of small dimension and they don't seem to create big problems to the ecosystem. 
To produce energy to long scale, a technology should be used with a bigger environmental impact. 
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of united boas among them. 
The force of the waves that makes move the boas up and down he/she becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders to the intern of the same ones. 
The pressure makes rotate a turbine that in turn feeds a generator. 
The electricity is a correspondent to the coast through submarine cables. 
For the time being they are four you implant them of this developing type, to the alone wait of the federal approval, to part of the energy, it could serve to for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial center and for a parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York. 
The movement of the water when there are tides, he/she makes rotate the yokels of the turbines, creating a revolvable movement that feeds the generator. 
Verdant has said that he/she has a long cast of clients awaiting the necessary authorizations to use the energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of the electric power, merita at this time the potential of the tides. 
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are but prevenibles that the wind, the sun or the waves and for that reason but reliable as energy source. 
It is mainly on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together to others that come closer to the costs, they have invested 7 million and half dollars in the 2008 and an investment of 35 millions is foreseen for the 2009.
