The European inflation slid in the foods
The fast inflation, registered in the area of euro, is due to the vertiginous growth of the price of the food products in the first place.
The increase of the prices in November has been superior to has been expected in the 13 countries of the area of euro, registering - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3,1 per cent - it announced the Office of Statistics of the Union with headquarters in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only gave as probable 3 per cent - it announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (BCE), unlike the North American, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, under the pretense of that the decrease, together with the prices in increase of the raw materials and the reduction of the forced unemployment, they would provoke a spiral of inflation.
The BCE wants to maintain the rate of inflation for below, but at least near two per cent.
According to an analyst, the BCE finds in the catch 22: "has that to negotiate" on the inflation so that later it does not have to take part in this subject.
The inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, beat the record of twelve anuses; since in Espana it increased of the 3,6 at 4,1 per cent.
The inflation went off in the area of euro as a result of the galloping nutritional and energetic prices.
The prices to term of the wheat increased by 88 per cent and the price of the soya likewise reached its maximum level since 1973.
In equal way, it had to be paid much more in the 2007 for the vegetable oil and for the dairy products.
The price of the crude oil in the world market increased this anus by 52 per cent, already reaching last month the black gold almost the 100 dollars the barrel.
According to the BCE, the inflation in 2008 will come off from the 2,1 per cent current to 2,5 per cent, however for the 2009 it will already decrease 1,9.
According to the analysts, the annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 per cent, however the annual average rate will be of 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, it is expected the BCE during the anus 2008 to reduce twice the types of interest.
Gallup foresees a governmental crisis
After a long stagnation, for beginnings of December the support of the Alliance of Democratic Youngsters increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, as the Gallup never before experimented a level that is so low - 13 per cent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the electors sure of the matches - due to the biggest firmness of the electors of the opposition - would mean a support of the more than two thirds (71 per cent) in front of the support of a fifth part for the socialists (20 per cent).
According to the enquiry, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of the Free Democrats they would not reach even the necessary limit to have some parliamentary escano: its support in the whole of the population is of two per cent.
Among the safe electors there is one per cent more of sympathizers in both edicts.
The economic atmosphere kept being deteriorated even in comparison with the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those that judged the economic situation of the country specially bad, since another 46 per cent thinks that the situation is quite bad.
The families, after afterwards of the most encouraging expectations of the spring and of the summer, are now more pessimistic as for the change of its own economic situation.
As for the next anus, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth part waits for an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consulted ones, cipher superior to any previous enquiry of the Gallup, estimated that the President of Government rather desempena badly that well its functions.
13 per cent of the consulted ones trusts or trusts Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, since Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of the consulted ones.
54 per cent of the population does not trust what is absolute in the Head of Government and 27 per cent does not trust the president of the Alliance of the Democratic Youngsters.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is of which, which proportion of the society thinks that it is possible to control the experimented unhappiness in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
Whereas after the disturbances of October of the last anus 35 per cent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government ruling, this proportion is at present only of 20 per cent, since the relative majority (33 per cent) thinks that the only solution is the celebration of new choices.
The interest in the referendum is characterized because 60 per cent of the interviewed ones to the question on the participation answered that he would probably take part and another 20 per cent said that it is probable that he takes part.
To comparative mode, only 55 per cent of the population would take part in "some general elections to be celebrated this Sunday" with safety and another 15 per cent considers its participation probable. With the current intentions of the electors it does not fit doubts of the result of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of the laws of studies, 79 per cent that of the service of medical consultations and 84 per cent that of the hospital attention.
If we only observe these proportions among the safe participants in the referendum, the 81, the 84 and 89 per cent of the electors it would refuse the introduction of the laws of studies, the payment for the medical consultations and that of the hospital attention.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupledits prices
The hypermarkets of the commercial triangle of gold of Budaörs maintained the average increase of the level of the prices of 16 per cent, with the difference that the IVA has not been increased by this anus.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This anus also increased the usual basket of Christmas of the journal Napi in an average of 16 per cent in the commercial triangle of gold of Budaörs, but in all the hypermarkets a growth very superior to the thousand HUF was registered.
As in December of the anus passed already the prices "had been shot" in the supermarkets of foods, like this was not experimented a porcentual drastic price increase in comparison with the high preliminary point.
However, evidently the fact is terrifying for the consumers of which the that the last anus could buy to a price very below the nine thousand HUF, at present they can not make it even for ten thousand.
The basket of Napi in the studied hypermarkets surpassed the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the basket of higher value was of 10 573 HUF.
(in the anus 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of the liqueur Unicum and of the fish kept in the level of the previous anus almost, but a strong increase of the fillet of breast of turkey, of the walnut and of the seed of poppy, was registered.
The price of the flour of wheat and of the bread followed the data of the Home Office of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have found also a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competence did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200HUF.
Equally it was surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
With everything, in the basket of Napi Auchan it was the most expensive, as Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to the prices of the Christmas of the last anus, Cora increased with one 15, as Tesco and Auchan with nearly one 18 per cent the prices that appear in the basket of Napi.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of the last anus with that of the cheapest basket of this anus, the difference has been 12 per cent, since the growth between the cheapest of the last anus and the most expensive of this anus has been 21 per cent.
The average growth was of 1480 HUF.
The anus the average growth of the prices passed was of 1206 HUF, so during the Christmas of the anus passed in the prices the increase of the IVA was felt.
Precisely this process was the one that destroyed the trade, the supermarkets visibly were incapable of taking decision on the margin of prices to apply for every product and of calculating the effect of the change of the prices on the consumption.
(If the trader plans badly the speed of the circulation of a product, it can lose an important profit in the margin that is adjusted at the sales volume.)
The increase of the price of the basket of Napi reached such ends as a result of the increase of the IVA, which the most expensive was superior with 1720 HUF to the value registered in 2006, whereas in the cheapest the difference was only of one 844 HUF.
This anus were not produced such ends, since the highest price of now has been 1630 more HUF than the last anus and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two navidenas seasons, a catastrophic growth was registered in the prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets the price of the consumer goods of first need grew more of 30 per cent.
(This not necessarily however confirms the ciphers of the Home Office of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods registered an increase of price superior to 30 per cent in the interval of 12 months.
So for example, besides the wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the basket of Napi, in this last case this hardly seems almost impossible, for in the price of this product that the anus passed in comparison to the base was quite expensive already, it was registered, in the worst of the cases 10 per cent of increase in price.
According to all the indexes, the suppliers of flour have a position stronger than those of egg, being able to impose the drastic increase of the prices even on the multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, talk constantly of positive results.
According to our experiences comprised, to most of the consumers of the three visited stores, the prices do not interest them any longer.
Of all the products they buy great quantities, taking the preserved foods through palettes.
In the manana of Wednesday, in the three stores big queues in front of the boxes were formed because it increased the number of the customers in a sudden way.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the volumes of sale are inferior, numerous multinationals complain to the institutes of enquiry because the admissions remain below its plans and not only in the case of the foods, but also in that of the electrical appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with the disinfectants
This anus have been registered in hospitals several thousands of infections produced by the improper application of the antibiotics in the first place.
The prevailing circumstances of hygiene in hospitals, the crowded of the beds and the overload of the staff do not favor the control of the infections - it states the medical one-department head of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with the disinfectants.
Not long ago an infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the department of traumatology of the Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a severe accident the presence of the bacterium resistant to the antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection took place in this same hospital at the beginning of the anus.
To one wounded of a severe automotive accident they gave it discharge of the hospital and the same patient little afterwards had to go back to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then an important operation for the presence of the bacterium in its organism has not been able to be carried out.
Up to the 10 of December of this anus cases of hospital infection produced by multiresistentes agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 - said Karolina Böröcz, medical-department head of the National Center of Epidemiology.
This means that in the hospitals with every safety this quantity of infections produced by multiresistentes agents has been registered, of the rest it is not had information.
Near the two third parts of the infections (683 cases) they owe to the MRSA, that is to the Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of the human beings they take the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in its nose without causing any illness.
The infections produced by the SA (for ej.: inflammation of the throat, amygdalitis, skin infections, infections of wounds) react well to the antibiotics and are of easy treatment.
However, once it is applied exaggerated or, improperly to the antibiotics the bacteria that normally react well to the antibiotics, are transformed into bacteria very resistant to the antibiotics and contaminate quickly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, for example infections of wounds or septicemia in the first place to the patients with temporary or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened organism, to elders or to people of little peso.
In the view of the doctor-director of the Hospital János there is not at all special in the infection of the MRSA, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA only is absent - it said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to the antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the staff of infirmary attends them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the adequate antibiotics for its treatment" - it said Tibor Nyulasi.
The hospitalized patients are examined previously to verify the presence of the MRSA in its organism, but not even like this can be avoided the infection in all the cases.
It is not in fashion to take exhibitions
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of the MRSA in most of the cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor for the prevention of the formation and the infection with the multiresistentes pathogenic agents - it states Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is produced fundamentally in hospitals and amenity centers, the hospitals should examine the hospitalized patients and to isolate immediately to you fall ill them that they take the MRSA in its organism.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals the sampling is not in fashion microbiological.
This fact is due also to the National Box of Health not financing these medical examinations.
So that most of the cases come out to the public light when the infections of the MRSA visible in the patient - it said the medical one-are already produced department head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union does rigorous commanderies for the application of the antibiotics in the human medicine and there are also national directives to treat the infections and pathological frames.
There is that empenarse in which the therapy with antibiotic is directed, that is, microbiological examinations to prevent that are produced by endurance in front of the medicines should be done, but the hospitals not always comply with this demand.
The sampling microbiological are still less frequent in the case of the itinerant patients or in the basic assistance - it stated Karolina Böröcz.
It is saved with the disinfectants
The scientific experiments have proved to another that in most of the cases the MRSA contaminates of a patient through the sanitary staff.
Therefore, desempenan a very important paper the washed of the hands, the use of rubber gloves and of masks, however also in this meaning are experimented considerable mistakes in hospitals.
The MRSA is contaminated through the transmission for drops and the direct contact among people, however in the national hospital circumstances is not always possible to isolate the contaminated patient.
It is more, the rooms of the hospitals frequently are crowded, the beds many times are very joint, although to prevent the epidemic, the patients should be separated at least by a distance from 1.5 meters.
Regrettably it can also be experimented on - it added Karolina Böröcz - that in the hospitals of less favorable economic situation it is saved with the disinfectants, there are few male nurses and many patients and because of that there is a bigger probability for the infection.
In the view of Karolina Böröcz, where the adequate measures of prevention are complied with, less infections of this type are registered or the infection of the pathogenic agent can stop.
Governmental program against the MRSA
The treatment of the infection with MRSA is an enormous expense for the National Background of Health Insurance, therefore in all the countries people fight against it.
In England there is for example a governmental program to prevent and to reduce the cases of the MRSA.
Apparently the program has successes, according to the supplied data, the infections with MRSA show trend of decrease in England.
The European Center for the Prevention and the Control of the Illnesses (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of the multiresistentes agents (among these the MRSA) and that of the hospital infections that owe to these pathogenic agents.
Negative the control of alcohol level of the commander of policeman that caused a fatal injury

Bulgaria, the property paradise of the UE
The development of the Bulgarian property market is admirable - the attention of all Europe goes towards that Balkan country before little mentioned.
What thing, where and those who still buy in the market cheaper of the UE, which will go up in price quickly?
Divisional analysis Bulgarian of D/Max.
The goal preferred for the property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is with no doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of the tracks of skiing and the chalet of the beaches.
The montanosas regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, since on the beaches Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Coast of the Sun", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but every time more people look for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of D/Max in Bulgaria, late or early also the central area of the country - as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - it will wake up the interest of the property developers and every time more people will buy properties in the specially cheap area of Rus.
In equal way the Sofia capital will be able to be attractive, the spaces commercial and of offices promise a fast recovery of the inversion.
Bulgaria is in the best path to be converted in one of the most attractive paradises of golf of Europe, being able to be like this a destination highlighted also during the other two stations, besides besides of the summer and of the winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors are already doing its purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
In the view of the analysts, those that buy properties in Bulgaria, make an effort also to change its life and its mode of living.
Most of the customers are English, but more of Romania come also of France, Belgium, Espana and every time.
Likewise the Maltese and Cypriot developers are present and traditionally there is many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the paradises of skiing.
The foreign customers can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of D/Max in Bulgaria.
Those that intend to be installed here buy properties new or renewed by a price between 50 and 100 a thousand euros or else old homes in bad state between 5 and 15 a thousand euros, to renew them afterwards.
They require good communication and access, besides for them is important the nearness of a big city, the stores and generally of a local doctor.
The buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 vacacionales destinations of the Germans) constitute the second category.
The property investors who do its purchases with the expectation to benefit to medium or long deadline constitute the third group.
The price of the capital properties goes in constant growth, since the demand is every bigger time.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest property prices, in the last five anuses these suffered an annual increase of 21 per cent
The increase of the price of the properties surpasses the growth of the salaries considerably.
Fodor and the six per Hungarian hundreds
As it informed the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the meetings as for experts will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official opening they will continue the negotiations as for ministers on the subsequent international climatic regime to 2012.
The experts and politicians proceeding from 192 countries of the world deliberate on the Waybill of Balí that it arranges on the subsequent efforts at the period of reduction of broadcasts, established in the Protocol of Kyoto, current up to 2012.
At present animated discussions on the individual among the developing countries and the industrialized ones are carried out.
United States it has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise ciphers, although it tends to arrive to the agreement that in comparison with the situation of 1990, even the anus 2020 decreases with one 25 to 40 per cent the broadcast of the responsible gases for the greenhouse effect.
Another great subject of the conference is than if the industrialized countries, besides reducing the broadcasts, are or not ready to offer helps material and technological to the countries that need it.
People arrived to an agreement besides on the help to offer the developing countries.
The background of support, foreseen in the Protocol of Kyoto, will be directed by a board of management integrated by 16 members, probably in the Global Background for the Environment of the ONU (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The six per hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the efforts of the UE of preserving its paper of vanguard in the global protection of the climate and promoting the firm of the new international agreement up to 2009.
The minister declared that the UE is jeopardized to reduce up to 2020, with regard to the level of 1990 by 20 per cent its broadcasts of gas, responsible for the greenhouse effect, independently of whether it will be signed or not the "subsequent agreement to 2012" and is ready to be jeopardized in decreasing even 30 per cent if the other big regions developed of the world and the developing countries are also ready to assume appointments as with its responsibility and its capacities.
Gábor Fodor noted that the signatory countries of the Protocol of Kyoto of 1997 committed themselves to decreasing by 5,2 per cent, in this the then 15 Member States of the UE were jeopardized in complying with 8 per cent of decrease.
The appointment of Hungary one may decrease with 6 per cent the broadcast of responsible gases for the greenhouse effect with regard to the period between 1985 and 87, that our country will comply - senala the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
It is a lot what is in game in Balí, since in two anuses it will have to be signed the international agreement of the long-term climatic policy, because if not, is insurance that its entry into force would be postponed for after 2012. In this case the appointments of reduction, assumed in the Protocol of Kyoto would not be followed immediately for a new international system of reduction of broadcasts, whose need was noticed in its most recent report for the IPCC, international scientific association of the ONU that is occupied with the climatic change, who obtained the Prize Nobel de la Paz.
With that, the reduction of the broadcasts would suffer a delay and could not be prevented an increase of more than 2 o C of the temperature average of the Earth, done that according to the scientists it would have incommensurable and irreversible consequences.
The exercise recruit British in YouTube
The units of the exercise British in a distributor of videos publish recordings on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize to themselves.
First the British air force (RAD) was the one that made use of the services of YouTube: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since the March 2006 are loading videos on its actions against the talibanes - it informed the BBC.
These recordings cameras gotten on on the helmets done with mini are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, afterwards they are sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
Already are 139 the recordings proceeding from the soldiers of the air force that this form has been loaded with to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75 a thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos so much of actions perpetrated in Iraq as in Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Office Commonwealth) as well as the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have its own channel YouTube.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with goals of recruitment, but in the view of the Ministry of Defense serve also for presenting it to the public the true goal of the presence of the exercise British in the exterior.
This type of advertising practically does not cost at all in comparison with the conventional television spots of recruitment - it declared To the BBC the expert in defense Gordon Mackenzie - however, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific form they justify the reason of being of the military actions decided on the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The exercise worries also because, besides the edited and censored recelosamente recordings, in the distributor also keen videos appear, for example on the death of the soldiers: in the films of advertising "officers", a little hypocritical, the officers talk at the most of leaks, without presenting however the bloody part of the combats.
Besides, of the battlefields of Iraq and of Afghanistan they have been loaded to the Internet already numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the exercise British alone lately are making use this opportunity.
The Americans use an a little different form for the recruitment with the freely dischargeable video games of shots named America's Army, in which the player can set directly in the middle of a more or less real situation instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and pastelillo salted in the holiday ofChristmas of the ministries

However, the minister of the work Mónika Lamperth does not wait to its colleagues for an official holiday navidena, but for a working meeting of end of anus.
The participation of a hundred and eighty guests that - as it informed the department of press - will take that is so single coffee and salty pastelillo is had, for what the holiday will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai however simply will drink with its colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for the Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finances (MF) will celebrate a navidena holiday in its own assembly hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The navidena holiday will have a budget of 2500 HUF for guest - of this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF all the anuses celebrate in the same way Christmas.
However, there will not be festive atmosphere, the official character will occur not only for the governmental speech, but also for the schedule of the afternoon of its celebration.
The wallet of agriculture will offer a reception of New Anus on 20 of January, in the Ministry Christmas will not be celebrated.
The reception will be celebrated in the Castle of Vajdahunyad del Parque Municipal and as it communicated the wallet, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF for person for the hundred guests.

In the department of press of the wallet of environment they could not inform navidenas of the Ministry about the budget of the celebrations.
What he knows is that for the holiday that will be celebrated in the Museum of the Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.

On Saturday a meeting of protest will be celebrated, since on Monday the participant trade unions will pronounce themselves in strike for indefinite time, if people do not arrive to an agreement with the government.
This means, that - on the day of the parliamentary poll on the law of public health - they did not inform about the date of the end of the initiated strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the law of public health, the trade unions will withdraw its call to the strike immediately.
However, if the law is approved, the commissions of strike will meet and they will decide around the future.
In base of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly it is also possible only that it is voted on the law of public health in the hours very entered from the night, or maybe near the midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, people will have to say with significant difficulties in the transport: in the railroads it will stop being worked by indefinite time, for the manana maybe a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more of half of the intercity transport of buses of the companías Volán is stopped.
Simultaneously, in numerous points of the country there will be closing of half of the ways of the roads.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have been stuck to the strike, its names are updated constantly on the page Web of the League.
Some trade unions announced its strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday the State Railroad and the Free Trade Union of the Train Workers (SLTF) could not even arrive to an agreement on the essential services, although, as the holidays of Christmas are brought over, every time they are more the people who travel in the trains.
According to information received until now, from the beginning of the day until the 13 hours the workers of the Group Carrier of Budapest those of Budapest Airport will be in strike from the 7 up to the 9 of the manana, the Trade Unions of LEAGUE of the Electrical Industry will celebrate a strike of four hours and of Thermal Energy, the Trade Unions of the Educators called a strike of 2 and the Democratic Trade Union of the Educators of 2 at 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will be pronounced in national strike in alternative schedules and the Democratic Trade Union of the Workers of the Sector of the Health and Social (SDTSSS) that are part of the Forum of Union Cooperation, will celebrate a tolen strike of two hours.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal related to the reform of the public health and submits a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they introduce gradually the new form of calculation of the guesthouses that will come into effect the anus that comes.
The third is that they guarantee, even before 2010, the possibility of the occupations that deserve it being able to enter to the system for the case of the advanced guesthouses.
The fourth motif of the strike is that the Free Trade Union of the Train Workers (SLTF) that belongs to the Trade Unions of League, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport on the train sidelines and wait for another different proposal.
Political Capital: In the country the risk is increased by theHungarian Guard
According to the Division of Analysis of Risks (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in the month of August of this anus with the support of the Movement through a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In the "warning on risks" of the companía it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the fact that "even in the short term with the worsening of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy population and not gypsy of Hungary, violent ethnic confrontations will be able to take place" constitutes the biggest political risk.
The main motif of that is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this character - it added the representative of the institute of research.
They stated that all that is due to one of the main lacks of the protagonists of the Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of the public life handed over the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, those who could found its political strategy on the existing discrepancies among gypsies and Hungarians to him".
This worsens the problem, makes the normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremists and increases the probability of the bursting of the violent conflicts - they estimate.
Besides that, according to the institute of research, the activity of the National Guard, for consequence of the great attention of the national and international average, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary in the exterior, especially as for the stability and to the democratic development of the country".
Us they remember that: from the otono of 2006 the reorganization of the radical groups and of extreme right of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 have been set up in the country numerous organizations that define themselves of "associations of national self-defense" received every bigger time publicity and impulse.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, whereas they proclaim openly the training of its members for the defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of the public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, of the exercise, that is of the State" - they add.
They stated: all that takes place in accordance with the method that he tries to give it a civil presentation to different political aspirations, basing itself on the unhappiness of the society with the policy and with the political parties.
Then to stand out what is civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only it serves to avoid the legal problems of the legal inscription, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of the relations of neighborliness.
"In the last months, in numerous adjacent States they referred to the Hungarian Guard as to a potential danger, whereas the ultra-nationalistic political figures of certain adjacent countries, want to justify its own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this is influential on the political stability of the region" - theyadded.
According to the institute of research, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a phenomenon isolated in the Center and East of Europe, so in all the region the political risks were increased.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar form that for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution Bulgarian (UNB) of extreme right was announced in the month of August 2007 for the National Union.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the gypsies who took place in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Making use of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the goal of the organization is "the national self-defense".
In its opinion, in the last 17 anuses there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained impotent and indifferent in the face of the facts - it remembers the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, indicates the increase of the risk of the ethnic confrontations the one that certain gypsy organizations of Bulgaria have announced that to withstand, they will constitute its own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard until now has shown resemblance to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it can not be excluded that also the gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar form, organizing its own self-defense - it can be read in the warning on the risks of the Political Capital.
The director of research of the Political Capital, Attila Juhász to the question of the news agency stated: the analysis of risks is one of the activities of the institute of research.
As it said, every anus publish its analysis of risks and when they experience something that can influence the change of the risk, they inform to the public opinion, as it happened in this case, publishing its warning on the risks.
The holiday is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines with accuracy the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and it has already been converted in a generalized practice that about the holidays - that the anus that comes will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the UE or in North America are theholidays unitary.
The Hungarian laws do a difference between national holiday, holiday of State and festive days.
The festive days they fundamentally relate to religious holidays and historical ephemerides.
We celebrate the New Anus also: the last day of the old anus, as well as the first day of the new anus it is festive - the latter especially so that they can rest those that passed celebrating the old anus.
During all the anus we have eleven holidays written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is national holiday on the 15th of March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on the 23rd of October, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 of August we celebrate the foundation of the State, the 1o of May the holiday of the work, we, the 1o and 2 o of November, we remember to our relatives and deceased friends.
Besides, in our country they are holidays of two days the Easter of Resurrection, the Pentecostés and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays few times coincide with a weekend, because of that frequently itself does bridge when before or after the holiday there is a single working day.
In exchange for the weekends lengthened like this, during the previous Saturdays he can not absent itself from the work or from the school.
He is the working minister that it regulates in its specific decree when people have to work exactly in exchange for the directly previous or subsequent day to the holiday.
This legal norm is of obligatory fulfillment for all the employers and for its employees, as well as for the employees and civil servants.
It is not obligatory however for the companies and institutions of services that, due to its function, work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This anus the working order will be able to be altered only around the holidays of the end of anus: from the 24 of December practically the life is stopped in the country, since according to the experiences, the majority of the people "it does bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the anus or take its holidays during these days.
The next anus several of our holidays will coincide with mediated or with weekends, for what there will be less changes in the working days than this anus.
First the agenda will be modified about the holiday of the work so that afterwards, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
On Saturday, 26 of April will be working day, for that in exchange on Friday 2 of May is festive day.
The other change is related to the holiday of the 23rd of October: on Saturday the 18th of October, people will have to work instead of Friday the 24th.
However, the anus that comes during the holiday of end of anus will be able to be rested, since from the 24th of December it will not be worked almost in any part, nor even if the last day of the anus it is a Wednesday.

You lose interest if you want to comply with the expectations of thepublic
The car advances slowly in the usual jam of the manana.
An extrano caliper is familiar in the radio: violinwith electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous pitches is added the low and afterwards the voice of a feminine chorus as a real jewel takes part.
The channel mr2 reproduces the song Wings of Love deZagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us a lot with electronic pop oneof quality.
But now this jam seems totally different when you are listening to the new disk of Zagar.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the national digital underground little by little go changing the image and even if again the style rock is in fashion garage, breaks guitars, the national pop electrum has proved: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer initiated its career into the city of Pécs, was due in the ensemble of Yonderboi until it initiated its independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of a same ensemble.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, a mixture of jazz, of bailable and pop electronic music, tried to triumph, when they asked it cinematographic soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The widest public knew the ensemble that at first acted alone in pequenos clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first disk edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national disks, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi almost as the only national former of trends, capable of being sold also in the occidental markets.
There are not doubts that Zagar and its ensemble are in fashion, but nobody has asked them if they take or not gustosamente this label.
The ensemble reacted as it must react: it prepared a new disk and still better.
The newly thrown disk, graduate Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to open new paths for them, although the bond itself intends to establish the continuity with the initial anuses in the city of Pécs.
Then this bond was one of the lines of the old ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
The reference on what is graceful is well, on the flight, but besides what was graceful of the music, the guitar that plays stronger, the effect of the rock and roll, now appeared - according to the spirit and the trend of the period -.
With these songs he presented the disk in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who at present works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
In the disk is included a real success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that lately it transmits from the manana to the popular musical night. This broadcasting station took the music of high flight of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($ivas Underground), up to the ears of the listeners.
Then everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked him Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question rises up: the one that you are interpreting, in that which measure is a music dedicated to a select public?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select public for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in the slight music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the one like this called underground alternative music can be gotten bored, meaningless and can be composed equally alone for the sale, which makes it commercial.
But likewise a good pop song can rise up from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works with this spirit, independently of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the welcome of your music on the part of the Hungarian public and foreigner?
B. Zs: Abroad, the slight music has greater traditions especially to the west of us.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty anuses frequent the concerts, but also the oldest.
They lend much more attention to the changes that are produced in his around in the slight music, because they consider it part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: Which function does the public have in your work?
Is it important to you who are, of where they are and how many are the people who listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I sit well when seeing that every time you seised more people to our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some goal, but for some motif.
The paper of the public is rather felt in the concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And however, I realized that if you want to comply with the expectations of the public, you lose its interest.
hvg.hu: Up to which point do you intend to follow the example ofYonderboi?
He works alone and rather did itscareer to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow its path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with that of it.
We rather work in equipment, we trust in the musical presence of the other one and leave that he manages.
At first it was unavoidable that they compare our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us initiate our career in its group and of there we started another path.
hvg.hu: In the hit parade of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people listened for the first time to the name of Zagar in relation to this song.
Did you open concientemente with this style towards a widerlayer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and to sell our disk with these successes.
This song is something more than that.
We add it at the end of the disk, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disk and of the heaviest subjects.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
For what precisely to them - which was the main motif?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a chorus for the gospel style.
Then the idea about creating this chorus of the soloists of good voice of our own national musical scenario came.
Like this that chorus of six women was created - that is Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which afterwards was baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose exactly like this the song or did the girls change any things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a lot of time in instrumental version ago and when we already had all the material of the disk, we think that something is still lacking.
The chord attracted the edge.
Still that night I recorded the song that later the girls learned it.
Everything arrived practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember myself, I got very excited then, but naturally needed also the Divas.
With my voice it would not have worked with so much force.
hvg.hu: In the concert as well as in the disk it seems as if the girls were in flat second.
There are not soloists (except the brief one alone of Judy Jay), do not have own paper, sing all joint and not more strongly that the music, for what the music not only acompana its edges.
Also in the scenario they are placed deep down.
Deliberately?
B.Zs: They are deep down simply for technical problems.
However consciously we did not want to distribute papers ofsoloists.
The song is also about that, about our forgetting a while of ours ego, the that who where has come and where it goes, we leave then that those wings, the wings of the love lift us.
Euphoric state of mind that we feel had wanted to manage that also others felt that when this song appeared.
hvg.hu: To which did you dedicate more work?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition in fact to none, at the time of mixing there were rather more difficult parts.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I am touching everything in a piano of concert or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where during long while the groove did not want to work and afterwards, little by little was put to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your song preferred in the new disk?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I "already have released" the disk.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earthand the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks thousands of millions for its inferiority complex
An unloyal embezzler.
Like this it is as it indicates its former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the gigantic French banker of Société Générale, owner also of the Bank of Czech Trade.
For it it lost nearly five thousand a millioneuros.
However, it rather seems that Kerviel was a big player who wanted to compare himself to its colleagues and, undoubtedly, with good capacities.
He sensed some time ago the crisis, unlike all the big Czech banks, in the American market of mortgages.
"It has a fragile character" was left oir of its superiors, the same ones that him sent to the police.
But what detaches of the answers of Kerviel as what the French media, as the journal Le Monde, show is that it was a man that to ends of year past had a profit of more than 1.600 million euros thanks to its businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All what I wanted to do was to gain money for my bank" assures in its answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis 500 million euros.
This opportunity already the vió to come at the beginning of year.
In February some news about the called mortgages started to be listened sub-has priority offered to customers of low admissions or those that in the past had problems with the payments and of which those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis did not have to be influential in all theeconomics.
Kerviel did not think it and bet correctly.
And afterwards, to end of year its profits surpassed the 1.600 million euros.
"When I already gained my first 500 a million I did not taste as notifying it" it confesses Kerviel and adds, that it has not been left at all for it, at all.
During all the interrogation it declared that it had falsified the records in such a way that people did not arrive to its discovery.
Even it got to trick the heads, even though the Bolsa Eurex started to show interest in its businesses.
The risk turned into profit
Did he fear getting to be discovered?
Rather, not.
"I thought that it had gained 1.600 million for the bank and that from that done simplex, that would cheer up them."
Out of where did it take so much will power to risk thatway?
In my position it had to be worked gradually.
He started to work in Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing studying in Lyons.
Its annual pay was handled among the51.000 you dolares.
Two years afterwards was already assistant of corridor of Bag and in 2005 was converted in stockbroker with an annual pay of 90.000 you dolares.
Like this it still tasted that it wasnever going to win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005 already I observed that they looked with caution at me.
Due to my formation and also to my professional progress and staff" described Kerviel to the investigators.
But at the little time of my entry in the company thefirst great success arrived.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz it won a bond of 500 million euros, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing a la baja.
And this meant a starting mechanism, and wanted more.
If it is that, we leave desires you
"This is as a snowball" said the police.
But it is said that the heads knew about all this or that they rathersuspected it.
"While it gained money, they closed the eyes."
Only that, afterwards, the knock arrived at the beginning of this year.
In a dia it lost a billion euros.
After the weekend to half of January he wanted to eraseevery mark.
When on Monday arrived to the work, any longer it did notwork in the bank.
And two dias afterwards, the bank announced that it had lost 5.000 million euros for its fault.
And how did they manage to locate him?
It passed to be suspect from itsholidays.
"I chose only four dias for the elapsed year.
The corridor that does not have holidays is a corridor that does not want anybody to throw it a look to its dossier" finished Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to obtain 365 a billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs of those that the Czech Republic can obtain 14 a billion euros (approximately 365 a billion crowns).
Practicamente of half of the total addition that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013 is treated.
Of seven operational programs they will go out approximately about 125 a billion crowns for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 a billion crowns of the Company Program and Innovation.
Most of the money will go destined to the transport, up to 150 abillion.
The Program of Transport is the biggest of the operational programs and represents even 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain of the background.
This money increases the budget of the state background for infrastructures of the transport that next year it will say with the quantity of 90.800 million crowns.
The businessmen and companies must use the program of Company and Innovation for the obtaining of resources in the innovation of the businesses.
The companies should obtain financing for the acquisition of new technologies, for the industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As for the current use of the backgrounds of the UE, the Czech Republic is among the paises rego backwards deposited less that they use them.
Sentence of twenty years for the expresident of Nicaragua,decreed the court
The Court of Advocation of Nicaragua decreed on Thursday the sentence of 20 years for the expresident of the pais, Arnaldo Alemán, that was condemned in 2003 by the embezzlement of 100 a billion dollars (almost 1.800 million crowns).
In spite of that, a despues time, he was released from the prison to pass to house arrest in its exchequer not far from the Nicaraguan metrópili.
It is not at all clear in these moments, according to the agency AP of which, the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again among fences.
According to the president of the Court of Advocation, Ileana Pérez, it will rather depend on the prison agents if they let Alemán finish its punishment at home or if they make it return to the prison.
Four years ago, the court proved as Alemán transferred constantly money of the government to the account of a company in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its relatives and partisans more cercanosT.
Part of this money finished in the background that German created to finance its campaign in the choices of 2001.
Like this they approved the budget for us
Like this it is.
The Budget of State was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first one elaborated by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget of this year was already approved with the support of SSD, because the minister Sobotka prepared it and not accepting it could not be allowed by SSD.
Apart from different debates before the poll on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional sight although the most influential, approved the new law with calmness.
It is a great paradox.
Every government starts and finishes with every chapter and departure of the budget, likes them or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but in it the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition is hidden.
It is important for the means of comunicacón and they dedicate a special attention to him because of that.
The political discussions are much more interesting than the simplenumbers are.
The Budgets of the State of the last governments of the Social democrats suffered from three blemishes that for this year of 2008 solving is not possible so facilmente:
The first of them is the high participation of the obligatory laws, called as of expenses of the leaders that are not only the guesthouses but also the social benefits that already last year they were approved before the choices for the "noiseless" coalition of SSD and KSM.
The second of them is the deficit in the economics as consequence of the first blemish.
The third limit is the deficit from the public financing, as the municipal and community budget deficit.
In spite of that, the biggest risk is not in the deficit from the Budget of the State.
This is public and relatively low control.
The bomb of watchmaker's shop, is however in the deficit of the municipal budget and community.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other fountains of inversion, apart from the money of the taxes, rates and loans of the banks, often emitted, meaningless, duties with which became indebted disproportionately to its town councils.
In the last years they managed to pay these debts by the massive sale of energetic actions and of other nets of development that they received of the state and of the privatization.
At present they do not have this resource.
If we bear only the official and verified facts in mind, we discoverthat:
Our economics, already some years ago, passes per phases of growth of the same form as the rest of the world, of what SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion so that its government put order to the finances of the State.
However, instead of that the state kept becoming indebted.
The rest of paises, excluding some as Hungary, Albania, Paquistán or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, especially, in the previousgovernment.
We belong to the nations that in the global measures we are less threatened by the poverty.
That's why the social massive programs that, for misfortune, in the last inutilmente years were inflated with gigantic measures are not necessary.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the choices, if shortly does not change the pensionable age and the reform of the guesthouses then will be the end really of any policy in this pais and, it whoever only governs it will be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians that they govern will transform into civil servants, mechanical delivery men of most of the money of the taxes for the retirement and the social benefits.
That's why, the budget of this year can not be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the expenses of the leaders.
The deficit planned of more than 70 a billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the last government had not wasted in the last ten years what could.
We, not quisieramos that the politicians that they govern are only converted in civil servants because of that, must be patient and having to grant this weak coalition of the government, which is given account that the state can only use up what it is capable of obtaining from the taxes and the rates, the calmness for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make possible the gradual achievement of a balanced Budget of the State.

The Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Swiss and Canadian decided to fight joint against the crisis of the financial Market.
In the Marked monetary will be received more than a hundred thousand a million dollars by licitaciónes.
In these bids the banks auction the types of interest in which they are capable of lending money.
For example, the American Fed will send a billion dollars to tender for forty, and the central banks of Europe and Swiss will facilitate afterwards another twenty-four billion.
After the attacks of the 11th of September, it is the first time that central banks of different states are come to an agreement in this process coordinated to protect and to decrease the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This crossing must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the growth contínuo of the free capital shortage that the banks could lend" wrote in its report for the customers, Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"This action coordinated of the central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States of 65 per cent to fifty per cent" added Baumohl in its report.
The banks have already used up sixty billion dollars in unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
The economists still wait for thousands of millions inleaks.
"The central banks must have fear of what waits them still really when they decided to give this crossing" said the main economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems to be that the situation is really badly" added.
The central banks fear having the same problems of access to the loans and because of that will have to lend more expensive to its customers.
This would reduce the consumption and would send jacket to the recession to the economics with different impacts in the growth of the world economóa.
The central banks like this decided, that they did not manage to reduce the called fee LIBOR, from London interbank fee that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that the banks feared constantly to lend money even when the Central Banks of US, Canada and Great Britain reduced during the fall its types of interest several times.
"It will have the same effect as another fall of the types of interest" told to the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting.
Some economists do not find strange that the crossing given by the central banks contributes towards turning the crisis on because it does not solve the basic problem that is the caida of the property market in US.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are incredible
The climatic global change affects especially the paises indevelopment.
The president Václav Klaus expressed himself again with regard to the issue of the global heating.
The criticism rose up now with the closure of the international conference of the ONU on the climatic change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented its book Azúl, not green planet, commented that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
As Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and of non-governmental organizations but the basic difference between the rhetoric that is used and the reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, are fireworks of words, substitutes of the solution to the current problems" said Klaus.
The Czech president during the presentation of its book underlined that this subject is very important for it and that it shows interest in that.
He expressed also its joy to discover its book translated into the German because as he said "many times only I find the caricature of my ideas".
Now the interested ones can inform themselves aboutits colorful opinions.
Klaus remembered that it is not a climatólogo but that has, according to its opinion, sufficient supposed as to write a book as this.
He is academician, with capacity for following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economist.
In the main moment of the closure its thought that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are normal, which on the global heating there is not an agreement among the scientists, expressed that the consequences of the current changes are not so big and serious, nor represent possible disasters and that the attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, inefficient and in a costly way unacceptable.
Besides experimented man with the totalitarianism he considers as unacceptable to impose the not proved opinions to others, what goes as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of the others.
To the questions of the present ones explained repeatedly that it is not "against the reasonable defenders of the environment but against the environmental militants that do not take the relation between costs and profits in consideration".
Of the same subject it talked Klaus in Vienna doesalready two months in the Institute Hayek.
600 a thousand people did not reach to change itsdriving licence
At six hundreds a thousand drivers were passed by the date to them and they did not manage because of that to change its old driving licence whose validity it finishes to end of year.
Today it is the last dia when the people can request the change for that the civil servants he of time up to ends of year in emitting the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that afterwards of new Year are found for the roads hundreds of thousands of drivers without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card not have changed it mainly those that not even want any longer to drive.
Whereas in the people they announce a rapid descent from the change of cards, the offices of the estan metropolis full of applications and the interest in the new card has increased.
The Town Council calculates about 2.000 daily customers.
In the queues an hour average is waited for.
In Prague the new card has not been taken by about 140.000 drivers yet.
The broadcast of a new card hard twenty dias.
However, it is possible to ask for the broadcast of the card in a deadline shorter of five dias.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
The drivers that obligatorily must change its card and do not reach up to end of year, but will go out to the roads without the valid card will be risked to a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The policeman can fix the infraction with an admonition.
If it is an infringement breach the fine will rise at 2.500 crowns.
According to the previous information that person who does not go to any part could receive a fine.
They could pay presumably up to 30.000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices so that they deposited moderately fines of a thousand crowns, at the most.
According to the member of the ministry of transports, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anybody.
According to it, the driving licence is a document in which the people can decide if they want it or not.
It is not the card of identity that every person must havevalid.
The people who do not want to drive should deliver the drivinglicence|driving license.
It is enough to bring it or to send it for mailcertified to the municipal offices.
To end of year the cards emitted during the years 1964 and 1993 stop being valid.
However, the drivers will owe little by little to keep changing the other types of driving licence.

The validity of the card that was emitted among the years 2001 and 2004 finishes in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about about 2,6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to the complicit detectivesof Berdych
The expolicias Josef Opava and Petr Koaík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych are going to pass between thirteen and ten years in the prison.
The Superior Court of Prague decided the reduction of the sentences, the first at a year, and the second at two years as definite expiration.
Praguense against the organized crime was going to fall, at first, for the detectives of the departamente between 14 and 12 years.
Against the decision of today any longer it can not be recurred, only through the revocation on the part of the Superior Court.
Berdych is also in this strong case but in the first place the verdict of the Court of first application waits for it.
In spite of that in other processes already he has beensentenced to a total of 16 years.
It can not receive more.
In January, the Court of district recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 people and the superior court, today, dismissed 16 of them.
Most of the accusations of the accused went refused by the research for they being invented causes.
According to the senate of the central Bohemia, the members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information of police fountains to the criminals, covered the thefts up, and helped the members of criminal group avoid the sentences.
These criminals delivered 30 per cent of its theft toOpava and Koaík.
The accusation refers to the penal acts carried out by the group among the years 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, its casualties suffered serious impacts in its health but also they are accused by the abuse of power as public agents and without license of weapons.
In the house search, the police found some pistols, ammunition with kernel of steel, a dirigidor of laser and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the accusation, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Excluding almost one twenty of men in this process the court has already recognized Berdych and ones accused guilty.
Other men related to the case of Berdych todavia estan testifying of other processes, and in some causes still have not appeared.
Tomás Pt and Maros Šulej, which for now has prevented the judgment, are in prison in Ireland where they wait for the definite decision on its delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account because it changes some children: 12million
For changing some children in the Home of maternity the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants of the hospital of Tebi 12 millions of crowns of compensation more the expenses of the judgment.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, a million.
The hospital offers at the most 200.000 for every father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondej Dostál does not agree in principle with the proposal of Veleba.
"Such a demand we do not pass it, is too high" said Dostál after the meeting of today.
So that we can do an idea about this counterproposal ourselves, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart sent to investigate.
We will find out whether it has a rescissory value.
We keep in the opinion that they will be hundreds of thousands for all" stood out Dostál.
The quantity should move between the 100.000 and the 200.000 crowns for each of the fathers.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of Jablo wanted a million crowns, for every month that they did not raise its biological daughter.
It watched was served as it bases to negotiate the compensation of the report of the specialist, only that this was elaborated in the hospital of the faculty of Motol in Prague.
The fathers of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The situation of stress was better stood by the men although they fought with recrimination by the change of the girls.
The women take it worse with the trauma that they are living at present and with regard to what it passes today, it completed Veleba.
Speedwell and Nicola were changed by the nurses in the Home of maternity of Tebi the pasadp year, on the ninth of December.
Last week, the girls went back to its biological fathers, Nicola to the ermákový to Pibyslavic, and Speedwell to Libor Bro and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo.
The governor of Vysoina, Milos Vystril, delivered 100.000 crowns as expenses of compensation to every family at the end of October for the error made in the hospital of Tebi that the region administers.
All the hospitals of the Czech Republic are assured by law as responsibilities for damages.
In the event of errors they must extract of the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask help to the administrator.
The court until today recognized them a proportionally low compensation, the additions that were calculated according to the boards that they say in hundreds of thousands and estraordinariamente of a million crowns.
Polívka wasted the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit on the brand Reino ofValaquia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava it was the first that used the brand Reino of Valaquia but was created during many years by Tomás Harabis with the one who the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not present itself today to thehearing.
According to its lawyer the cause probably has not finished and its customer will recur.
"The lawsuit consists in that Mr. Harabis and its equipment are some parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka" said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For it, in the face of the words Reino of Valaquia, to all the world the image of the actor and comedian comes.
The same idea has also Harabis.
"We take about ten working years after ourselves.
Search of money and invention of activities" said.
For it, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized" that the project has success and that because of that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work" added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the brand Reino of Valaquia was used first by Polívka in its program of television.
In 1993 it was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a matter of orientating it to the creation of afictitious kingdom.
Some years editing the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia happened to Harabis afterwards.
From that comedian origin was a business and a lucrative company activity of which Harabis created afterwards the society Reino of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the use of its name and firm in the passports and it even offered its owners discounts to the vistantes of its farm and assistants to its shows.
Who will sit in the throne?
The judge also today determined that Harabis only used a simple idea that Polívka made public in the scenario for its own business profit.
"Clearing that Bolek Polívka helped to the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia" "is" said the judge.
It added however that it is in the spirit of the project Harabis and its equipment that dedicated themselves to that completely.
The collaboration, among the parts today divided up, continued until 2000 when Harabis organized the official coronation in Vsetín for Polívka.
Since that moment "Boleslav I, the chosen one for always," started to give each other conflicts between Polívka and Harabis whose culmination arrived with the overthrow of the "king".
The leading role in the kingdom, by mediation of Harabis derived Jarmila Šuláková in the singer, as mother reigns.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabis and its society that until today has been refused by the court.
Something in clearing could bring in the litigation, the competition for the throne with its princesses, who Harabis is already preparing.
Of it the new king should go out.
He has not wanted still to reveal more data nor dates.
"We do not have any haste.
It should be something as the path of the king towardsMoravia.
The king should be chosen on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can be presented added Harabis.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: surpassed prejudices
To say truth has never liked me too much the Peugeotu 206.
Its characteristics of course were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, it manoeuvres and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I, only already have to think it better for me me.
When I proved the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, complained, for example, about the space of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Combi means in this sense, that I am not going to suffer in front of the two linear meters.
Flying for the world
Crossing through the rapidamente interior not to repeatit too much.
It is an elegant design where the only blemish is the poor central tunnel.
Here he would value the invention of design more although the writ already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there remain the times in which we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral address has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here it can be felt how the measures of the bodywork have grown.
In the Combi the mentioned shortage of space disappears in thehead.
Suitcases to the trunk
But what is main in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I must value it as very accessible (thanks to the foldable back portón) and a storage well divided up.
The estan clearances equipped with belts of gum that mean an ideal solution.
They are not troublesome, and can extend up to the point of holdingheavy objects.
But let's stay in the deposit.
According to the boards, in basic regime has a capacity of 428 liters what in comparison with the competence is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we find out that the Peugeot is had by the rear with his perceptible 52 liters.
Of holidays to the foreigner or when placing the pram of the child its value is critical.
But if it had to comment a little positive then I must mention the flat that remains quite flat after bringing the backs of the second down sketches.
120 horses in four courses
Our tested automovil was equipped with an encedido of injection of four valves on a capacity of 1,6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to say truth like this is as it should seem one 1600 that it despised the relative five doors.
It is noiseless, consumes little and, especially hasimpulse.
If I compare it with the period of the skoda of then that seemed as if the exhaust pipe were blocked by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices answer
The price of the car is not for all the pockets.
We must take, however, that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine into account.
The basic price of the car with firing of injection of 1400 for 329.900 crowns, is still been able.
Our attachés put it from 410.900 crowns, what it isalready too much.
The type Premium tested already reaches another 80.000 crowns.
Only that tendriamos still airbag in the heads, automatic air-conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper, automated back windows...
That is, the car with everything of everything, costs 531.900 crowns.
It is a lot, but has the complements of the equipment in the Fabia and will arrive to a quite similar number.
Now only it already remains to be decided for cual ofboth brands.
The Slovak students do not integrate into the English schools
In the English schools children of paises of the east of europa attend and, the villagers fear more changes because of that at schools.
The integration of the Europeans of the east for now only brings a series of problems.
Even the British schools register those cases where the conflicts between the emigrants and the children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of Europe of the east in the British schools it remains very well illustrated in the septentrional city of Kent where the conflicts among the natives and the Slovak emigrants start to grow.
Discussions, estorsión and rows among students already have reached even the fathers themselves.
The situation has arrived so far that the police of Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman that it was sticking sticks to a student of ten years with a green stick.
In its defense it said that the girl was insulting its son with insults of racist pitch.
The police had to act also after an attack of two girls under age against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls overwhelmed it with racist insults and threw himstones.
"When ibamos home, a boy approached towards us to the shutdown of the bus and started to spit to us.
When I said that it left it it it did us the gesture of throwing us apples and pears, and afterwards the trousers was lowered and showed us its bottom" described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are of both parts.
One of the natives even designated to the conflict with the emigrants of the east of europa as of fight for the survival.
The cases already mentioned previously, show us as the atmosphere in the English schools starts to be quite tense.
In Great Britain there are 70.000 Slovaks who came registered here for work motifs.
Approximately about 30.000 Slovak students attend the English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the vistantes it is really the island of thefreedom.
Anything that waits of its holidays can get to be complied with, always that eliga correctly.
Sand beaches and dorado fish, big waves or a calm sea as apond.
the palm trees and the all inclusively with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, frozen or varied cocteles.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the island of the Caribbean sea it can find all this andmuch more.
Only in an island it finds still much more and that island is Cuba, the biggest and the most beautiful of all the islands of the Big Antilles.
In the period of the Spanish, Cuba got to be the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place that human eye hasseen.
Havana was converted in store and port of burden of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and took to Europe.
And afterwards it arrived the American period.
The National Hotel grew at the end of the twenties.
It sent it to build one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, already that all what there was of criminality in US (and therefore, forbidden) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among its guests they were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings rose, for wide avenues they moved the cars that were a symbol of cult in the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an exchequer in San Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar it had its yacht.
In the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left its firms the stars of the show business and politicians of all America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita habanense you can leave also its autograph.
In the bar of the expensive National Hotel the coctel mixit according to its desires.
And those cars already of cult of the fifties, until today they keep working for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that they already arrived some time ago they have been rusted among these humid and salty winds.
Still when Havana, especially the former neighborhood keeps being deteriorated notably, there is not in the surroundings so many marvelous colonial monuments as there.
Trinity is metamorphosed into beauty by other places, for example.
Because the tourism brings so much necessary money, its development this guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels not only in Havana but also in Slipway, in the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets as Coconut Key, Key Guillermo and others grew.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is very valued by the lovers of the railroad.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations up to the factories of sugar for narrow vias in steam engines or electrical.
Its coach houses per tens of years were not discovered and, machines that work and whose models brothers who there are in other parts of the world only find in the museums, are now there.
Where to go?
The place most known for most of the vistantes does not change.
And because of that, it is not necessary to speak more of Havana orSlipway.
Perhaps, only to remember that in the already mentioned exchequer of Hemingway there is a museum that for those that are lovers of the writer, must not stop visiting it.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba in thewest of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in lands of calcareous rock.
Fertile lands thanks to which roquedales that hide dense vegetation are formed are acclimatized by Mogotes, pylons of calcareous rock and rocks of high sheer in the caidas of the valley, and in its grottoes.
The valley is the place where it is, probably cultivated, the tobacco of biggest quality in Cuba.
One of the factories visiting habaneras of pure she can find its finished product.
Perhaps to somebody it seems interesting to him that there the Chilean part of the series, the Biggest Zeman, was filmed.
Trinity
City of old lineage that was founded that not a lot people afterwards of the Spanish colonizing the island.
The slavery and the sugar brought it fame and wealth.
The wealth turned into beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinity, between the sea and the saw of Escambray, is such a remote place that still in the fifties of the last century there was not road that joined it to the rest of the pais.
Such an insulation helped it remain out of therest.
Nothing new was built and because of that, neither, nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy of having where to live.
If is had more time of being in Trinity than an alone late, it is worthwhile to know interesting places in the near surroundings as the Beach of Ancón or the valley of the factories of sugar.
the night belongs to the Home of the Music, which cheers the silence of the mornings up with its music.
Baracoa
Some consider, small city in the west end of Cuba, as the most beautiful of the island.
With safety that opinion already is confirmed through thepath itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass for high and cracked mountains, like this how for a nature that hardly knows the action of the man.
This oriental place of Cuba has been inscribed as Patrimony of the Humanity through the UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they do the best chocolate, in its church have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later of the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was found and that now there is a hotel with its same name, the mountains can be seen and among them the best known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, pure, the Master Saw, the Bay of the Dirty and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the boss of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santería, African religion that the descendants of those slaves practiced, with all that many pages could fill up.
However, as it is made out, that better sees it sometimes.
The allies are debits in Afghanistan, say the Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing in the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO, according to the American minister of defense, Robert gates, should design a specific plan for the next years.
The misón in Afghanistan is not being as it was thought, coincided in Edinburgh (representative Escocia)los of the paises that have troops in the south part of the pais.
At the same time as the conflicts with the movimeinto grow Talibán, today, the eight states participants discuss on the plans and coordination of the allies.
Whereas United States this week through its minister of defense, Robert gates, cheered up at the forces of the NATO to a bigger activity, Big vé Bretaña as priority to reinforce the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of the help to the development.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following one is to make for the population that they alone can start the economic development possible and of safety" she told the broadcasting station BBC the minister of defense, Des Browne.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data of the American army is bigger than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew in comparison with the last year by 27 per cent, and in the province Helmand up to one 60 per cent.
The pàises of the NATO have in Afghanistan about 40.000 soldiers of which the fourth part are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have arrived to the same limit as for organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly more helicopters, soldiers and pra experts ask that they train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously in specific goals for the future and the way in we reaching them" said Gates.
In a similar meaning the General Secretary of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, also talked today.
"It does not cheer me up to know that it is what we have in the earth and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety per cent of soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that is little" said De Hoop to the agency Reuters in the closure of the meeting of three dias with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
The one who is passive
Among the attendant paises in the last months the controversy of whether all the allies do the maximum in Afghanistan reigns.
For debit Germany was criticized, for example.
"The Germans have a relative number of reserves in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimum violence and the demands of fight there are not as high as in ours, in the south part and this of the pais" it said Gates.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to play whereas our boys fight" wrote Sun in a material accompanied with photographs of German soldiers playing the ping-pong.
The German Bild answered to the attack and published a photograph where the British troop played a match of rugby in the south part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will reach the trillion in 2009
For every Czech the State owes 84.000 crowns.
The total debt amounted in September to 842.700 millioncrowns.
This year the government planned to be lent 159.200 million coronasV.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan at 152.800 million crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economics of the budget of the state.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September at 842.700 million crowns.

For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84.000 crowns.
For all last year the State became indebted with more than 111 million crowns.
For now it seems to be that thanks to the low deficit from the next year we could pass the border of the trillion of crowns up to the 2009.
Next year the debt should move among the 900.000 million and the trillion of crowns" said iHNed.cz, the economist of Homeland Finance, David Marek, for the servant.
In a similar way also the economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, sees it: "We could pass the trillion during 2009.
Exactament when that will depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it were seen that the situation in the political scene changed and the politicians were capable of saving, it could then defer to 2010.
But such a change I" do not "see" it added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and rises up, especially, from the accumulation of the deficit from the budget of the state.
The debt of the state is paid by treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or for example loans of the European bank of Inversion.
The interior indebtedness of the state grew this year of 38.500 million at 719.400 million crowns.

The average expiration of the state debt increased in 6,5years.
"The interannual total debt of the first to the third creción quarter 13 per cent that which is enormous given as the economics works.
It is interesting that the growth is generated especially of the duties where there is a growth of 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand exhibition with which it is going to be negotiated until there is a reform of the guesthouses" commented on Pikora.

He compared today Jartúm in front of a court to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British professor judged in Sudan for insult to the Islam has been condemned on Thursday in the afternoon for a court of Jartúm at 15 days of prison and to the ejection, indicated its lawyer.
The British were accused of having let pupils of 6 at 7 years give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when every representation of the prophet of the Islam is illicit.
It was pasible of a sentence oflatigazos.
This British schoolteacher of age of 54 years in function to the Unity High School de Jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday in its home and accused of attack to the Islam and of sedition, by virtue of the article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, consequently of several complaints of fathers of pupils before the Sudanese Ministry of the education.
The history soars in fact to the month of September, when this professor asks its pupils, of 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of the children, as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", the director of the school Robert Boulos counts.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children of every 23 have elegigo to Mohamed as preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but on a whole very common name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children have carried out a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following one legend "Wed name is Mohamed".
The bear it - same not took no label with this name, but the problem is simply the one of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to the Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, professor in the same school in Sudan, needed it to know it well and to never have done something that can be offensive towards a religious faith, "I only sit it that it has asked the children to vote for one name", is only dealt according to it of a "error innocent".
Opinion divided up by numerous pupils of the schoolteacher that describe it as "very attentive towards his pupils" and "that it never talks of religion in class"..
We remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name most given in Great Britain, is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often elegigo for the Muslim families is a mode of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But which are the rules that concern the use of this name?
Can we give it for example to a toy?
It is of course a question of interpretation.

They must run out as they have started: in the Boardof safety. "
The journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had answered that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the statue", adding that every unilateral statement of independence on behalf of the Albanians itself would do "in harmonization" with the Occidental.

It will have been needed to him more than seven working hours in the space to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and to its colleagues of crew of the international Space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of a ripped and essential solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, of its distance from the inhabitable modules, of the rapidity with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapuceados" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released the module Harmony, a cylindrical thick part responsible for receiving soon the European scientific laboratories and Japanese (to see framed) from the shuttle Discovery.
This module is a type of platform of landing for themodules-laboratories.
But they have to be able to be provided in electricity.
The second task of the crew was for to displace a module of production of electricity with solar panels that weighed 17,5 tons, already presents in the ISS, for put it in its final position.
After his having been displaced, the crew started the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that have an importance of 76 meters.
And is where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in little more or less of a meter for a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped not to damage the panel more.
The astronauts, who had at first to carry out an exit of control of the shuttle Discovery, and to go afterwards to repair another panel to tile whose system of rotation was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And Scott Parazynski is the one who has been chosen to go to twist at the end of the 30 linear meters of the arm controlled from a distance of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (andador of thespace) of the Fish Trap.
High, resistente, very skilful, has the very developed torso and the long arms.

It had helped it the segundo "spacewalker" that had been kept near the airlock and, of the interior, for other astronauts as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool that it used, a ministick of hockey wrapped with insulator to avoid the electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundreds of volts, has been conceived and "chapuceado" by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation had been finished, Scott Parazynski waited so that the panel is totally deployed before before of making the inventory of its instruments and of returning to the interior of the station.

The choice of the statu quo
No surprise on Sunday, on the exit of the urns: the Russians are going to opt massively for the match of the president Poutine, Russia joined.
Confirming its aspiration to the stability, even to the authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the parliamentary elections, the Russian president Vladimir Putin directs them today to the electors a message televised on the public chains, already registered but whose contents are kept secret.
He makes it as leader of the list for the joined Russia, the pro-Kremlin match whose victory is revealed overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything show through receiving the foreign ambassadors, being content by delivering a new burden against the West accused of interference - its subject of penchant during the campaign.
"We know the price of a real democracy and want honest, more transparent and more open choices, choices without incidents", added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign sullied by pressures.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says than has "never had such dirty choices, even in the period of Eltsin".
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, to the ex champion of the world of check Garry Kasparov, condemned at five days of prison for illegal demonstration, the visits are prohibited according to its lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus"
Behind these parliamentary elections without surprise two much more open questions are outlined:
Who will happen to Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first turn of the presidential choice, on the 2nd of March 2008; the candidates have up to the 23 of December to be made know.
Chosen in 2000 and chosen again in 2004, Vladimir Putin can not request the third consecutive mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
Which paper will stake Poutine after March?
First minister?
Head of the majority parliamentary and of the very powerful Russia match joined that elegería the government and the president?
Or the that is, to the parliamentary elections as to the presidential ones, the overhanging power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, owners are not felt of his destination", the sociologist estimates Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the state university of San Petersburgo, soars further: the civil society was postponed in this country christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community deferred the formation of the individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties, "Poutine reestablished the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by the terrorism, but for a certain comfort economic" esteem María Lipman, of the Foundation Carnegie.
Today the Russian "renounce for own will to the personal liability" of those who briefly had proved after the bursting of the USSR.
" For what to reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all the social layers, once the worldof the matters has been included.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the statu quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of the joined Russia..
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the nineties.
The opinion prefers the stability.
On behalf of that the Russians will not vote either for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, professor of age of 54 years: " For what to reflect?
Those that are to the power are not too bad, why to change them? "
A heavy memory

The 47 million documents of files, stored on 27 km of estanterias to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not consultables only in a "humanitarian" end up to here, that is in an individual and nominative way, at the request of a former casualty or of its derechohabientes.
The eleven States responsible for its management - as Germany, France, Israel and the United States -they came to an agreement themselves in May 2006 to open them to the searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement for all the States has ended, the aperture is effective since yesterday.

Until recently, several States, as Germany, opposed the aperture to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive character of certain information.

The records of the concentration camps or of the orders of arrest established by the Gestapo had been brought together after war in a practical end: finding the compatriots deported or subdued in the obligatory work and, eventually, bringing forward them a proof of its internment, in order to open the way to its compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen lines a limited interest.
"There is not anything fundamentally new that it has to be waited of these documents", had declared in 2006 the Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center of busqueda on the anti-semitism in the Technische Universität of Berlin..

Will there be rally of end of year in bag? The experts, divided up by the crisis 'subhave priority'
A less than five weeks the closing of the exercise to be thrown off, by the investors the hands are already rubbed expecting the traditional rally of end of year to arrive.
However, this year the experts do not have so clear that this is going to take place.
Banif thinks that "from the statistical point of view, the month of December in bag it usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not convenient to carry out forecasts being based exclusively in the statistics, more even because in the current context, the uncertainties stalk in the markets, at least in the short deadline.
Although they are not partisan of the bag catching carrerilla in the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is held by the existence of liquidity, ready to invert the lack of alternatives with accountability, especially the fixed yield, affected by the escape effect towards values of quality in the long sections as well as in the short ones given".
Because of that, they think that the bag will rather have a behavior lateral, I do not exempt from volatility "especially for the impact of the probable descent from the types of the Fed not being known, the high level of the crude oil and the danger of stimulus of the inflationist tensions given".
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, coincides so moment to dare to say that there is going to be rally is not good.
"The thing is not for many joys ", insures the expert.
The Ibex has lost nearly one 4% from the maximum marked on 8 of November when the index closed in the 15.945,7 points.
Still like this not all the experts have this vision that is sonegative.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, thinks that the Ibex 35 could close the year nearer to the 16.000 points thanks to the restructuring of the wallets and to the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place all the years on these dates.
However, the expert points out that the things will be a little different this year since he thinks that the rally will be advanced to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that the volatility is going to affect the trend of the market.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, it values that we are near technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be seen impulse given to him depending on the news that arrive of US as for the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree at the time of choosing the values that will be the persons in charge to take the Ibex towards new maximum levels.
Sunny Spot, of Intermoney, states that "this year himit touches" for the great values".
The expert would include the two big banks and some builders in the wallet because when the date arrives, the electrical sector will be very expensive.
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the rises will come from the hand of the banking and of the industry sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it occurs.
"ACS takes several months recovering positions and we expect other builders as Ferrovial and FCC to follow its same path", explains the expert.
The cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase of the sales in the season of Christmas sales.
On the other hand, the expert thinks that the technological ones will also do it very well although in this case there is not a lot of representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven year
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a decreasing month.
Exercise in which the stock markets came out from the crisis provoked by the puncture of the technological bubble, was lived in 2003 by the authentic rally of end of year.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28,17%, December registered a rise of 6,68%.
It will have to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (the Ibex for the moment raises 8,36% since January) and whether it manages to have its rally of end of year.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours of Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew many of its offices.
In total 200, the ones situated in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branch offices, which will operate under the brand on Popular Max, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to give the jump to bet in the uninterrupted opening of its agencies up to the 20.30 of the afternoon, and to open Saturdays of 10 hours to 20.30 of the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated the schedules of its branch offices, BBVA, on several occasions which he wanted to extend has not decided yet to give the crossing.
While, is about to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon to close an agreement with the trade unions, although not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive so that other entities are noted or not to this initiative that seconds the schedules of the trades.
Precisely the goal that Popular intends with the project is this.
Collecting the particular customers who move through these areas to carry out its purchases, to the pymes, autonomous and trades of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 open offices in all Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodelling of the already existing.
For that, the entity will modernize the branch offices that it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that the customers of the different streets present.
This way, the enlargement of the schedules is accompanied from a conception different to the space of the branch office and a new design, more current, with more luminous colors.
The one responsible for commercial banking, Angel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not mean a great inversion, although if a bigger personnel contract, since it is passed of having about six employees for site to eight or nine.
The offices, which will have even spaces so that the pymes can meet there, will sell not financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular it has already tested itsinitiative in three offices of Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel explainsRivero.
The branch offices of the streets Brave Murillo, O'Donnell and Great Way of Madrid have been the chosen ones, and seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular account at present with 2.500 branch offices.
And another 60 that operate under the brand on Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very detailed schedules, who even open Sundays and public holidays.
In these sites of PopularMax they will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a big fan of not financial products for its sale.
'We do not want to do the competence to our customers', indicatesRivero.
At the moment, they have arrived to an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with external staff to the bank.
I telezincify doubles for the first time the value in Bag|StockExchange of its competitor Aerial 3
We' have 'obtained' it.
With that sentence Paolo Vasile, managing director of Telecinco, at the end of the market, when he confirmed that the chain that it directs doubled the value of its competitor, Aerial 3, expressed yesterday its satisfaction.
Only one aspect tarnished its joy: it 'is what hurts me, is not because we have grown more but because we have lowered less', stated.
Still like this, insisted in that in a soft market, 'we have fallenless'.
I telezincify finished yesterday the day with an advance of 2,54%.
That profit situates its leak in what wetake from year by 15,66%.
The value in Bag of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the asset) and taken part by Vocento (another 13%) reaches like this the 4.488,88 million euros, according to data of Bloomberg.
Its competitor Aerial 3, which yesterday yielded 1,52% and accumulates a descent of 40,5% since January, costs the half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other companies of communication appreciated rises at 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Haste (editor of Five Days) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Aerial 3 is due to 'our being talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are capable of doing, in the same market, to what cost and how we achieve a return on it in terms of audience'.
I telezincify announced last week that foresees to be converted this year in the first television channel in surpassing the 1.000 million gross advertising admissions, as it insured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and of Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the publicity of the group.
Of this announced data being done real, the television channel would register this exercise an increase of 3,6% in its invoicing of publicity as for the 965,4 million the exercise 2006.
On its part, the net invoicing of Aerial 3 increased 1,6% in the nine first months of the exercise (until it reaches the 734,4 million) whereas the net admissions of the television grew 0,7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts note for the best relative evolution in Bag of Telecinco is the high pay out that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the company presided over by Alejandro Echevarría divided up 100% of the profit among its stockholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is soon to take the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its matrix Mediaset.
'We have the official appointment to give at least 50%, although we have always testified much more.
This year, I expect us to be capable of leaving happy our stockholders, to whom we have already given value with 33% of Endemol.'
According to the analysts, the market gives exhibitions in these moments of a certain tiredness.
Lehman Brothers reduced recently its estimations of profit on Telecinco in 2008 4% and in 2009, 7%.
It is owed, explain, to his having cut the anticipated growth of admissions of 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and of 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the forecast of profit of Aerial 3 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: he recommends buying both values basing itself especially on its high earning capacity for dividend and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Madrid Box: he sees better Telecinco (to accumulate) than Aerial 3 (to maintain) for the 'attractive multiples' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: he recommends infrapondering in both cases as it has 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).

The Law also obliges the companies of services of inversion to spread key of its profile of business in the information market on the aspects, exhibition to the risk and forms of risk management and it requires from them that they carry out, to facilitate the monitoring on the part of the CNMV, to take a record of all the operations.
In its crossing for the Commission of Economics of the Congress, several modifications, among those that it highlights that the titulizadas debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument its high dangerousness given for the investor, that has remained proved with what has been happened with the debt of mortgages of high risk American (subhave priority) were incorporated.
Besides, advantage was taken by the transposition of the directive to delimit legally the functions that can develop the holders of a diploma in Economic and Commercial that it 30 years afterwards of in 1977 the real decree being approved of his delimiting the functions reserved professionals to the economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, as that of the mediator, who will work by foreign account, will not require the authorization the CNMV and will be able to give its services of commercialization of products and of collection of customers to different companies of inversion at the same time.
The blended IPC increases five tenths in November, up to 4,1%
This indicator, which Eurostat uses afterwards for incorporating it to the calculation of the index of inflation in the European Union, provides an advance of how the prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication answers the policy of Eurostat and of the European Central Bank (BCE) of offering comparable data in time and quality to the ones produced in United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Indice de Precios de Consumo Armonizado, but using different methods of statistical modelización to estimate the information of the one that is not arranged at the moment of its publication yet.

Bond agrees to leading the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and presiding over the Congress if they gain the
The ex minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offering of the prime minister and general secretary of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the case that the socialists gain the general elections.
Like this the secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and the Bond itself have announced it in press conference, after the meeting that it has maintained this midday in the federal headquarters of this match with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the ex minister because "it is important to count on the best" in the political life and Bond "is among the best".
Besides, he has noted that yes it seems that the manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists beat in the next choices.
Bond would replace as president of the Congress to Manuel Marín, which made public on 15 of November its decision of not being presented to the next general elections and of giving up its career in the active policy to dedicate himself to fighting against the climatic change in the university area.
The ex minister has recognized that the prime minister has not stopped insisting so that it went back to the political vanguard since he abandoned it two years ago.
Besides, it has indicated that, the same as the citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the PSOE wins the choices, its match has wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If it reaches the charge, Bond expects to convert the Camera in "the home of the respect and not of the insult or of the shout". and making "it "resemble the citizens every time more".
"Sometimes regrettably seems that, times interrupted the prime minister on a certain occasion the only site of Madrid where it can not be spoken with calmness and with calmness is the Congress it in the Senate 26.
Likewise, it has had words of praise for its current president, Manuel Marín and "his good to do" and has not wanted to already be seen occupying its post not to fall in what, as it has indicated, its opponents could see as "prepotency".
Climatic advertising
Since the movement against the climatic change subdues persecution inmisericorde so much to the sceptical ones of its predictions as to which they give priority to other political and social battles, it is obliged to showing a coherence of iron.
And more a leader of the movement that is prime minister as Shoemaker and believes that that fight is more important than that of the terrorism Islamist and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges it to explaining why the action, or the inaction, of its Government they have contributed decisively towards Spain leading the UE in noncompliance of Kioto.
Who are the ones responsible for the noncompliance, in which sectors has it taken place and why has its Government, that of the contract with the planet, not prevented it.
Besides, it requires from it to explain to the Spanish with the maximum clarity which are the measures that it is going to take to stop the climatic change.
Which companies will be seen affected, which habits citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energetic savings we will be obliged to doing, which economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But not even there have been those explanations nor there will be thoseexplanations.
Precisely because it is a matter of being sacrificed and of paying.
The measures against the climatic change, the realmeasures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts ofcompanies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Shoemaker who has hurried to deny it.
That is, that it is a matter of saving the planet with the nothing, with pure advertising, with eslóganes empty of every real consequence.
With impactantes sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, newcharges.
With contracts with the planet, that man who is so useful for the election campaigns that it not even speaks and denounces not even demands, but it adorns the meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a contracting party merely virtual and does not intend to move by bicycle or to refresh ourselves with the fan.

My family doctor releases one of its articles on strange research titled for me: 'The money causes cerebral activations, especially if the others receive less'.
That is, that the feelings that the monthly pay of the workers generates depends of what the colleagues gain.
The study has been carried out through magnetic resonances tomográficas in the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group of Image of Neurocognición del Instituto Life&Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation took place when the participant answered correctly and its colleague failed".
The investigators observed that if when they both succeeded they received the same pay, the activation was moderated, but if one received the double, the activation was bigger.
I do not know if it required so many science thisconclusion.
The prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del ponte takes eight years intending implacablemente to the criminals of war of the Balkans from the office of the Penal Court for ex Yugoslavia, placed in The Hague.

Which insurance do I need?
The insurance of car, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, means an important expense that will depend on different factors, such as the age, the sex, the antiquity of the card, the marital state, the type of vehicle to assure or the use of to this, among others.
To have the car only is the beginning.
And is that, to choose the insurance of adequate car is even more difficult than to choose the model of vehicle.
In the first place clearing of what we are speaking has to be had.
The insurance of car is an agreement between an insurance company andthe insured.
This appointment materializes in a contract of insurances, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium agreed on in exchange for which it is made responsible for the duty to pay the compensations in the event of accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account different factors, such as the age, the sex, the antiquity of the card, the marital state, the type of vehicle to assure or the use that itself him of to this, among others.
The insurance companies establish its prices according to the statistics, so that to bigger probability of suffering an accident, bigger fee to pay.
It is for that reason why the biggest of 25 as well as the women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics reflect that they have a smaller index of loss ratio due to its prudence.
Likewise, resorting to the counting, the companies have arrived to the conclusion that the married people tend to have less accidents than the single drivers.
The use that itself him of to the vehicle will influence in the frequency, and with that in the probability of having some type of mishap.
When increasing the frequency they increase the probabilities.
The variables that the insurance companies take into account at the time of establishing the price of the premium are many.
It is because of that, that the driver has to study well the situation to choose that insurance of car that better is adjusted to its profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, besides adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers him a fair price.
The youngsters younger than 25 years find different inconveniences at the time of hiring an insurance to an affordable price, as they are the reduced experience in conduction and the antiquity of the card.
Although what is ideal to be well made sure is an all risks insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for one all risk with exemption, so that they obtain the coverages of an all risks insurance but to a more feasible price.
This class of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the accident.
"The part of the amount of the accident that contributes the customer will be preestablished according to the value of the premium, which what lower is the amount will be higher", specifies Luis Noguera, maximum responsible in Spain of First Europa, online mediator of insurances.
Another option is an augmented motor third-party insurance, so that the protection is assured by the customer in the face of induced damages to third, although not in front of the ones caused in its own car.
Besides, it would be covered by theft, fire and theleak of the vehicle.
A board.
If you are younger than 25 years he tries to be careful and to prevent the accidents as much as possible, since this will have effects on the increase, being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
An increase is a reduction on the base fee that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this fee base.
"The increases and penalties will depend on the company and on the profit for this.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to be allowed increasing the increases", rinses Noguera.
The strip of the 25 years passed the drivers have it easier at the time of hiring an insurance, since the index of loss ratio comes down thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommendable thing is to hire one all risk with exemption.
"Normally the youngsters can not make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of being cost in an accident, and even at the time of the conduction", insures the director in Spain of the European company, to what it adds that most of the accidents take place in the second year of conduction, once the 'fear of the novice' passed already.
However, if the customer is married but he does not have children yet it is preferable that he negotiates an all risks insurance, provided its economic situation allows him it, of course.
On its part, the marriages with children are considered by the insurance companies as the public with smallest index of loss ratio, therefore the surcharges will be smaller.
In this case the best insurance would be one to every risk with exemption (being able to be this of 300 euros), or, when a high level of increase is had, one to third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed conduction and they have a bigger purchasing power the luxury of assuming a quantity of bigger exemption to be allowed", sentence Luis Noguera.
For the retired people an all risks insurance with exemption (being this of 150 euros), or one is recommendable to third extended when it is had a high level of increase.
It has to be said that the insurance of car is a little important, not only because it covers the driver in front of possible sinister, but also because he represents an important expense, reason why it is basic to study adequately the insurance that we need more according to our personal situation.
The Celtic looks for a point that costs the eighth in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that misses them to achieve its respective goals in the closing of the liguilla of the 'Champions', since to the Italians it serves them for to be first and to the Scots to declare its classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified in the fifth day its pass with a draw in Portugal, whereas the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to be assured than the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives to the Benfica, that it has four, not it ahead.
These two matches of the Group D will stake all the sixth day that a week people before of his finishing, since the Milan has to dispute the World Championship of Clubs in Japan, where he starts out on the 13th in semifinals in search of a post for the end of the 16th.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the rest and the draw in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although both equipment will try to go out to for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that gaining it would remain first and a better cross would be assured in eighth.
To the ensemble of Gordon Strachan it could serve it even a defeat for being classified if the Shakhtar does not gain, but it will not be able to be entrusted because to equality of nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, that they lost the week passed in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Like this, the milanistas will try to turn bitter it the night to the Scots, that they count on being put in eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and in a consecutive way, that they were defeated precisely in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the prorogation (1-0) after the 0-0 of the departure.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the Shakhtar for which it only costs the triumph, in the case that it loses the Celtic, so much to enter will be in eighth as to continue in the UEFA.
And is that the Benfica, despite being last and without options of following in the maxim European competition, it could reach the third post with a victory, with what the UEFA would play.
20.000 people attend the first concert of the tour of the Spice Girls in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have initiated its first tour in Vancouver (Canada), before about 20.000 spectators, since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared that the meeting of the group is "shining" little before starting its concert in the stadium GM Place of Vancouver.
About 20.000 people used the entries up to witness the concert that included a video in which the history of the group that did fury at the end of the years 1990 is related.
The remeeting and the world tour coincide with the promotion of a new album that comprises its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls came out to the scenario exhibiting some bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British soccer player David Beckham, had given them.
The sportsman was among the public that crowded the GM Place, even though the nerves of Victoria had forbidden it to themselves days before.
In the previous one of the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham indicated that the British star "has not seen our wardrobe, for anything, so I am nervous on what he is going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' whose exit of the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" provoked the dissolution of the quintet two years afterwards, it also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"It was scared.
It was nervous but saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling through the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought cause not, so I am happy for having taken the decision" it said Chisholm on the meeting of the group that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also indicated that with time, "the things have been fixed and we all want ourselves a lot".
But many things have changed boards since the Spice Girl acted for the last time in 1998.
To start, according to the television CTV, the group it arrived to Vancouver in a special airplane of Virgin Airlines.
On its arrival in the airport, an army of nannieswaited for them.

In Madrid they will act on the 23rd of December.
New fears on the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The increasing dispute about the price of the gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that it affects the export of the occidental fuel to Europe on the part of Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (UE) is directed across Ukraine, for what every rub between both nations is fountain of attention.
Kiev has noticed that if Moscow increases the price of the gas, Russia will have to pay higher indirect rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced the supplies to the states of the UE.
The last dispute between Kiev and wine Moscow with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopólico owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the quantity of money that had to pay Ukraine for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared to Ukraine that he will charge more, since this has committed itself to paying 50% extra in 2008 for the gas that comes of the neighbor Turkmenistan.
The analysts say that it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more by the imports of Gazprom.
It "is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important traffic for the gas during the conversations" said the Ukrainian Minister of Economics Anatoly Kinakh to the news agency Reuters.
"The changes in the prices of the gas should not be related to our arguments on the levels of the indirect rates [towards Western Europe] via Ukraine".
The last great dispute about the gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supply to Ukraine into January of the 2006.
This meant a fall in the exports to Western Europe, what raised the prices quickly.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the supply of the UE.
Russia has the biggest reservations of gas of the world, but most of it is not yet completely developed.
As result, Gazprom complements its own supply with gas of Turkmenistan and other Soviet ex nations of Central Asia.
NHS "it will have to prove the foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the registries of criminal records of the employees out of Europe, said a watcher.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black came that it was proved that a foreign doctor was related with the attack to the airport of Glasgow, in June.
Black also showed its worry that the Scottish NHS does not have exact idea about the quantity of foreign staff that it counts on.
However, its report indicated other controls that are carried out correctly through an exhibition of five authorities of health.
The general auditor chequeó the quantity of foreign staff hired out of the European economic area, as a result of the attacks to the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor of the Hospital Royal Alexandra de Paisley, was arrested in the airport after a jeep being startling in the doors of the terminal building of the airport.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey for conference video in October, accused in relation to the supposed attacks with car bomb in United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out the checkups of pre-employment to the candidates, it to be assured that they comply with the cualificaciones, the experience and the authorization to work in United Kingdom.
Although the board of health of Scotland uses "Disclosure Escocia" to carry out the controls of penal background, the agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information out of Great Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends that help to the employers with the penal controls in many countries went from Great Britain, among other measures, which the boards should say with the guide of the Criminal Records Bureau.
"Although we find some of the searching with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine revision", says the report.
Black declares that the Scottish NHS has a high level of fulfillment of its own employment policies, but he indicates that: "our report highlights the areas that can be improved to guarantee that the necessary information is had in the number of foreign staff of the NHS."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "very little probable" that the checkups of pre-employment can identify potential employees of NHS that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the checkups of pre-employment work in NHS Scotland but is not clear which is the markup of the done recommendations", explained.
The Scottish authorities of health declare that at present they count on 1.161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor noticed that the number can be higher, partially because the boards have problems in to identify which are the employees that say with indefinite authorizations of residence.
The research also found that the procedures of checking established by the authorities of NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being complied with widely.
This includes the controls of passport, work licence and checkup of cualificaciones.
The Scottish government is revising at present the policy and guide of pre-employment of the foreigners in the NHS.
The secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon, testifies: "It had a great interest that this work was carried out as a result of the terrorist attack of the airport of Glasgow.
It added that the Scottish government, as a whole with the boards of health, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that what planned on publishing the next month will be reflected by this in the update of the guides of control of pre-employment for all the work groups - including the foreigners.

Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that he arrested 208 militants of terrorist cells that planned an imminent attack to oil facilities, as well as attacks against monks and forces of safety.
The state television of the supplier of oil bigger of the world said that one of the cells was planning the smuggling of missiles.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have set up a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants formed by resident foreigners planned an attack to an oil installation in the province of the East, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35.000 cash to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the biggest oil plant of the world, after an unsuccessful attack of Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, mentioning a declaration of the Minister of the Saudi Arabian Interior, said that 18 of the arrested ones belong to a cell led by an "expert in promotion of missiles", who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned the entry by smuggling of eight projectiles to the country.
Another 22 of the persons under arrest were planning murders of religious leaders and forces of safety.
The government warned to the religious leaders that owe are more assets to stop to the Saudi Arabian that they travel to Iraq to be joined as militants to Al-Qaeda to fight against the associated forces and to back up the Muslim government Shiita, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Arabian Suníes.
The militants of Al-Qaeda have in the sight many monks in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, who dominates the government.
The militants -recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of TO the Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass to the government pro-west of the country- had as residence goals of foreigners associated to the government, buildings of government and energetic facilities.

The arrest includes another 32 people accused of giving the militants support and financial support.
Climate of Venus can give an idea about the future of theEarth
Venus could have been once an appropriate place for the life, declared scientific yesterday.
The data of a European spaceship in orbit showed the planet more resemblance to a cufflink of the Earth of what had been observed previously.
Venus is the planet nearest to the Earth.
Both planets have similar size and take up similar orbits, although Venus is slightly nearer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that acted as the Earth an inhabitable planet, the scientists believe now.
But the effects of the carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by the solar radiation and the slowest solar rotation sent Venus to a type of very different development.
Today the planet does not have water, the temperature of the surface is sufficient to melt lead and it is eroded by the hurricane winds and storms of lightnings.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, a panorama of how the Earth could develop offers catastrophic changes because of the climate.
The professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics of the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus mission Express, testifies: "Is being clarified cause the climate in Venus is so different to that of the Earth, when they are two such similar planets.
"Our new data make possible build a scenario in which Venus started as the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment millions of years ago."
Police confiscate "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, that they declare is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A portavos of the police declared that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but it said that it could have been sold by 1 million dollars (480.000 pound sterling).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says that it is not worthy that the presidential candidates answer the questions of a monkey of snow.
However, the republican candidates for the presidency eventually access to maintain a debate in YouTube, in which common and ordinary voters record questions in video and them send for its broadcasting among the candidates.
None of the questions presented in the afternoon of Wednesday 28 of November were more ridiculous than that of the monkey of snow that it asked to the democrats about the climatic heating in the debate of the republican party of YouTube was.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the republican party of face to the choices of the next year.
It is not known exactly how the producers of the CNN, who co-sponsor the debate, chose the videos of YouTube to show the candidates to candidates.
But the first hour average of debate, the longest dedicated itself to a single subject, was focused in the immigration.
The subject is one of the most powerful commonplaces for theRepublicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters for them to raise the dial when they listened to ideas that they liked: the issuers noticed peaks of approval when the candidates talked with extremist arguments.
By the hardest exchanges of words of the night Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr were hit. Romney, which has been top in the crucial enquiries of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney for it was soft with the illegal immigration when it was mayor of New York.
It attacked to Mr. Romney, accusing the ex governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in its home.
They both answered aggressively when they asked them whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing the illegal ones to regulate its situation and dandoles the possibility to obtain the citizenship).
The youngest candidates as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congress man, and Tom Tancredo, a congress man of Colorado, achieved agreement with the subject.
None have the word of being nominated candidate, but both remain in the career perhaps because both warned on the subject of the immigration before that the other ones.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share points of view: increase of the surveillance on the borders, intolerance with the illegal immigrants.
This commonplace, beside the fear of the toxic toys of China and other worries about the exterior, help to the republicans to forget, or to minimize, the divisions between the liberals and the Christian conservatives.
But the debate transformed in uncomfortable when other subjectsappeared.
To Mr. Guiliani asked it why it had supported the arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated about whether the immersion in water had to be considered a torture.
A person asked whether the candidates believed in every word of theBible.
This took to Sr. Giuliani to run towards the position of which to although the Bible was its favorite book, the did not believe literally in the history of the Jonás and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death sentence.
Mike Huckabee -in the first place in the most recent enquiry of Iowa, against all the expectations thanks to its Christian conservatism of long it now dates- said that the death sentence was painful but necessary.
When it was pressed to answer if Jesus would be in favor, the laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent as to be candidate in the choices.
The career is still unusually open.
The sr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, in a coincident way with the campaigns of collection of backgrounds of the liberal Ron Paul, and its hot declarations of the debate of Wednesday.
The two of them have gone out from the background, because the two wings of the match did not arrive to agreement on the most famous and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united winner on the greatness of America to the match in an early way and convincingly with a message, satisfying both wings of the match.
This time the match is divided up and the result is far frombeing clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hollow in which to sink; butequally it emerges
As the political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
Do not seem to have been sold influences, nor they are exhorbitantes accounts of hotels in Paris, not even sucked of extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the match of English labour government, of more than 650.000 pound sterling (1,3 million dollars), for nearly four years using false names, and that the match did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the first minister eluded calling to a choice, insulting stupidly the British intelligence declaring that the publi-opinion polls did not influence its decision, the expectation was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead of that, as Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leads with increasing cleverness, because the feared Sr Brown has passed of being Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The ransom of Northern Rock, a bank in problems, proved the regulatoria weakness and the poverty of judgment in moments of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the code of taxes has post to the, joint company groups, against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million particulars that revealed an unimaginable administrative botch.
A trio of withdrawn generals initiated a riot in the camera of the Lords, protesting against the cuts in the military expense: being ministers of the armed forces is, claimed, an employment of half a time.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the labour general secretary (and previous accomplice) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that the Sr Brown walks irrevocably towardsthe exit.
The governments can arrive to an inflection point afterwards that they are incapable of governing.
The people does not believe them as politicians, but in a usual way fail its incredulity when a new set assumes the control.
Once clearing that the first minister can not improve the things, which does not subtract it much time, is that suspension is of more: the civil servants start to fail; the ministers of cabinet are exposed; the press looks for bad news; and the government sets to the defensive and is not focused.
In a part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders it can not be defended arguing that it is new.
Even if he wanted to forsake Tony Blair, hewas its superior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the tax of record of authority, are related to the decisions that Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And still when it is not directly wrapped in the setbacks of Blairish -or "cash for members", the research of the financing of the political parties - the voters can assume that if it is it.
However, the situation of Sr. Brown is not as bad as itseems.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, nobody has died, nor has been swindleddirectly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give the that the trends naturally Stalinists of the sr. Brown have promised always: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of the donations is a good example.
The sr. Abrahams, which compares its donations with gifts of charity, public recognition says that it does not want for its benevolence.
This perhaps is like this, but the decision not the socketit.
The laws against the anonymity for the big political contributors is clear and there is for a white reason: the public has right to knowing who is buying access to those that they have the power.
The sr. Watt, that it made out that it knew about the agreement of the sr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously it will confront Jon Mendlesohn, head of collection of backgrounds to whom it was asked on the donations in October.
But Sr. Brown until now is not implicated: there is not anything that suggests that he knew about these performances, although the thick one of the payments was made that he took control of the office in June.
Up to the moment the first minister has done half of the work.
It has been quick at condemning its match because it violates the law, but, a commission of investigation on the matter -driven, to a certain extent, by a judge and a bishop., dilutes in the decision making for a familiar matter
In this case, the morales are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of thepolice.
Besides, there are other things than the sr. Brown must do, as finding a permanent and independent head for the Commission of Norms in the Public Life, for has not had one since six months ago, and besides it must press by a genuine reform of the financing of the matches.
This will require a hard cooperative work of the Labour Party members with the Tories, and maybe a renunciation to the special financial situation that is had with the trade unions -bitter measures for one partisan as the sr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The conservatives now have a good level of support in the enquiries; he has two years to win voters; and the only way that can move to the victory is in acting with an impeccable integrity and a solid competence.
Card sharks
The crisis of the mortgages subhas priority is it infecting the American market of the credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim touched around.
Today that the American market of the house is in crisis, the predatory ones have its looks put in the market of the country of the credit cards.
The analysts in Goldman Sachs calculate that the leaks in credit cards can arrive at the 99 million dollars if the crisis of the mortgages subhave priority contaminates other forms of consumable loans.
Signs of infection already are seen.
There is an increase so much in the charges of cards as in the rates of delinquency, that the proportion of the balances that have not been redeemed measures or that they have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced the last month that it has taken 1,4 million charge in its business of financing to the American consumer, partially due to the weakness of the borrowers of the cards.
However, it is very early for the panic.
The slowness and the delinquency are in low levels.
According to Moody's, an agency of qualification, the third quarter the rate of delinquency of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained partially by technicalfactors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of the people (2005) place dió to a brusque fall in the applications for bankruptcy, which in turn represent a great leak in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of slowness) would be growing again, or it can happen that the conditions for the borrowers kept worsening.
The industry also obtains solid rates of payment, which they show how much of its debts people pay the consumers every month.
And the confidence in the credit cards and the values backed up by assets is quite firm, in spite of the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, an investigative firm, predicts that the volumes of broadcast for 2007 will be nearly one 25% higher that last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis among the mortgages subhas priority and the market of the credit cards certainly exists: the consumers like to load the debts at the credit cards now that the credit entities are expiring.
But the issuers of the credit card look more the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that the prices in fall do not work necessarily a change in the deserving capacity of the borrowers.
They can even work to excel the issuers.
The incentives so that the consumers keep redeeming the mortgage decreases if the estates are less valid than the value of the loan; and as result, the payment of the debt of the card goes up in the list of priorities.
The issuers of cards can also answer in a fast way and flexibly to the difficult conditions that the lenders of mortgage, changing types of interest or altering positive balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a fast reappraisement ofassets.
"We are not going to wake up a day and evaluate again all the loans", says Gary Perlin, financial head of Capital One.
If a sudden infection of the subhave priority in the market of the credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a held descent are much more real.
If the prices of homes are more basses and a contraction of the loan push to America to the recession, the industry undoubtedly confronts a more severe future.
Those dorsal fins have to keep being guarded.
British bankers declared guilty in case Enron
Three British bankers who went to judgment for its responsibility in the frauds with the previous head of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocents of seven charges of fraud because they were colluded with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to become rich at the expense of the employees.
They were sent to judgment in January.
But during the audience before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the district U.S, each was declared as guilty of coslowworm in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC in the Royal Bank, became famous cause in Great Britain for the procedures of extradition that lasted two years.
In United States, its case marks the loose end of a research launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
At first, the charges against the bankers went of having warned in 2002 to Fastow that it was goal of a governmental research on the fall of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - it folded the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent schema with Fastow and its previous superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had inverted in one subsidiary of a society of Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the creator of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped its spiral of fall in the bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew that it would value at rise.
A company under the control of Kopper bought the interest of bank of the subsidiary in million $1 of dollars.
The bankers paid dollars to Kopper 250.000 for interests in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow represented falsely to Enron, for the energetic company would pay $20 millions to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received nearly 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January of the 2004, Fastow was declared by two charges of conspiracy guilty in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of British was arrested three months afterwards.
Fastow is complying with a sentence of 6 years in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is complying with a sentence of 3 years and amonth in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay 1 million dollars that they required to live in the United States while the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of the seven biggest companies of the nation, declared in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of tricks in the accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make its businesses that fail seem successful.
The collapse made waste thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market capitalization and more than two a million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive head, Jeffrey Skilling were ordered accused the years passed by its roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
The sentence of Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when it died of an attack to the heart last year.
Not even down not even out in Moscow
The price of an airplane Gulfstream G550, equipped with an engine Rolls-Royce and sufficient capacity of fuel to fly direct of Moscow to Los Angeles, starts in $54 millions of dollars.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"Capacity has passengers up to 18", says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But none ask for that model of so many seats because it is for familiar private flights or for presidents of a company".
The sr. Firer was person in charge of the booth of Gulfstream Friday passed in the Fair of the Millionaire, an orgy of four consumable days celebrated in a center of events in the nearness of the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, another 200 suppliers of luxury had installed its stands of exhibition, expecting to attract the new rich Russians towards every type of products, from yachts coffered in mahogany up to the grills of cars inlaid of diamonds, worthy of 50 cents.
The sr. sight Firer cautiously a shining orange Porsche in the stand adjacent to his."
It "is a beautiful car, but is nickel and coins compared to us", it said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second biggest market for the private airplanes."
Supplied with fuel by the apogee of the oil, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was in apogee.
"We live the same in 1890, when some rich Americans came to be brought together in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," it says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Centro Davis for the Russian and Eurasian studies of the University of Harvard.
"As the Saudi Arabian ones of the seventies and the Japanese in the nineties, the Russians are emerging as the biggest consumers and gastadores of the world".

"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the costliest and the best," said the sr. Gijrath, which patrióticamente sat in a stand of the Dutch real porcelains Delft, in front of a mural size reconstruction of a paint of Rembrandt, done of tiles painted by hand.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the vendors said that the rich Russians of more trajectory (10 at 15 years, for the Russian estandares) have changed its tastes from the showy logos to the brands of limited editions, which would not be exposed in a commercial fair.
However, several thousands of people: ready millionaires, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.

The cost: $22,000 for to set of four.
"The Russian millionaire that wants wheels of leather of ostrich or a portrait of its wife done of buckets of zirconio, does not go necessarily to drive on those wheels," says the sr. Karapetian.
"It is going to hold the car inits garage, beside another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, the sr. Karapetian clarifies that the sentence "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusiveness, the wave of prices of the property estates given.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow it does three or four years, is already probably a millionaire, at least in the paper if it is not it in cash," said.

Surgery "botch" could be cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day prior to Action of Graces when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A little healthier" restaurant and vió how an ambulance went through White Cape Cod, two doors more down in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, a car of the patrol of the policeman appeared.
And afterwards another.
"Then I saw to go up the ambulance", said the sr. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant, that day Wednesday.
"There it was when I knew that somebody had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, of 41 years, assistant of the director of the department of the policeman of Newark.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not identified by the police yet, but who works in the home of the 212 of the Ave. West Scott.
The authorities yet do not determine what caused the death of the sra. Brook, but wait to the toxicological test although the results will not be available until some weeks. That will help solve the mysterious death that it has troubled at the top rows of the policeman of Newark.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant of the director of the policeman, Garry F. McCarthy, from September 2006, and its voice it was relative to many in the department.
"It was loyal, working and tenacious", says the sr. McCarthy on Brook in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian".
She protected me".
The sr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-officer of police of Newark that works for the Commission of Control of the Drinks Alcoholic, and that left two children of 14 and 11 years, and a stepchild.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman of the prosecutor of the Union of the County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That is one of the possibilities," declared Walsh.
It "is a research in progress."
The authorities said that they arrived the home nearly 3 P.M.
Of the 21 of November and found Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
She was declared dead man in the place.
He has passed more than one week and the authorities have said little on its research or on the owner of the home, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine which part of the home was used as medical consultation.
On Wednesday, nobody answered to the door in the home of Mrs. Castro, where a withered rosebush is placed in the front part of the home, and a Dalmatian barks in the subsequent part.
A blue drum labeled as "ethyl vanillin" - used as substitute for the vanilla in foods and perfumes - was in the door of the coach house, next to a door that it drives to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks at a side.
The sr. McCarthy said that when it reached Newark after 25 years in the department of the policeman of New York, Mrs. Arroyo was of an invaluable help to know the new insular city and its rough political culture.
"It would say, "you have to keep watch with this or that",said.
"It was always here when I was, and also when not.
It is shameful."
Itself waiting that the federalreservation will cut back the rates to lift theBag
The actions came off at both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after which the market expected the federal reservation to calm the conditions of loan with cuts to the interest rates, which were increased with the tranquilizers comments of the vice-president of the central bank of the EE.UU.
The bags were loosened in London, New York and across Europe that Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reservation, declared that the makers of policies must be "flexible and pragmatic" in answering at the tension continued of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down the markets in the middle of increasing exhibitions of bags of loan, the sr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "invested in the market by the improvement to ends of September and during October partially".
If the bullish tendency persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for building societies and businesses, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by the investors as a signal that the reservation is ready to inject fresh asset in the markets of EE.UU and to do posterior cuts of the interest rate, to stabilize the conditions of the loan.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the economics of the EE.UU, as the sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence it was highlighted for a notice of Bear Stearns, merchant bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4% of its total manpower, in a global reduction of costs to compensate the leaks of its inversions in the mortgages sub-has priority of the EE.UU.
It is expected only 20 of those posts to enter London, where the bank employs 1.500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones went up in 331 points, or 2.55%, to the closing to 13.289.40, whereas the wide index S&P 500 raised 2.65%.
In London, the index FTSE 100 went up 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to the closing to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 a billion pound sterling to the value of the companies of first order of Great Britain.
The index Dax of Germany raised 2.6%, and CAC40 of France was on 2.3%.
Before, was stood out the reappearance of the tension of the loan in the markets after a strong demand in an auction of backgrounds at three months of the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to the European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest fee since April of the 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reservation and the ECB and to inject backgrounds extra in the stock markets in London, tensionaron the loan and the rates of the loans at three months "Libor" among the British banks, the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, meant it after a constant rise since the 12 of November.
England takes the demands for Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara withjudgment
Here there are two dilemmas, each so difficult as the other one.
Who must knock 6 for England in Kandy to the No this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none are less important in front of the first proof against Sri Lanka, who must take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan- with that particular bond at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and because besides the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is starting to be filled with offers to be converted in national selector, and if not, in one part swindles.
The that it obtains the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but the life often is unfair and the sport also.
It is not easy to throw what does a man in the summit of its profession, while another never goes more alla of the inferior level, sometimes for lack of luck more that for capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, for judgments that always end up being subjective are required.
Is it the time exactly so that Bopara gets up?
Is it exactly for Shah if he makes it?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant executive youngsters with good degrees and that know the business well, had to be promoted to the board: only there is place for one of them.
Who must say which is a good level for a player of cricket, unless they give the following chance the occasion of sinking or of swimming?
The figures naturally have one big influences in the decisions, but like this they also have opportunities.
In an equipment, a player of cricket has to grasp the eye of the captain at the same time of taking a wicket and a batsman to obtain opportunities of changing the order if it wants to have impact as player some day.
But to collect the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many that they improved the season passed, for example, James Anderson, that it probably plays in the first proof even if Stephen Harmison is declared and bowls as the wind for fit in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 careers for each to gain a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had its high moments and can wait more of these.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stadium of Asgiriya can be only one question of opinion.
The option can break or to do the career of a man, or can mean a small difference.
Four years in Sri Lanka ago, Gareth Batty played in every proof and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but was Paul Collingwood, fighting to settle at the same time the one who got to be converted in a player of importance, and despite writing down one a hundred double against Australia in Australia, can be still underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in the session of today in the stadium of Asgiriya, will follow its survival instincts and they will favor the biggest experience of Shah for on the exhuberancia of the youngster Bopara.
There are arguments for both of them.
In favor of Shah is its diamond and valuable proof of debut of beginnings of the 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten careers in its two turns in May against West Indias in the proof in Lords, its home as player of the Middlesex, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed its place for the following meeting, it seemed to have taken of its batting something of élan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the equipment of Essex has joie ofvivre in swords.
It catches fire for anything in the field of cricket and its attitude was summarized as when it overturned its vehicle in an exhibition for the sponsor of cars of England, Volkswagen.
It suffered injuries of smaller importance and, presumably a shock, but the first thing that did was to take its Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and to call Alastair Cook, its team member that looked to the distance, to say it with excitement: "It dresses that?".
Bopara is the best player, is including its slippery pass to have effects in its moves that seem to satisfy it, then batea with confidence and skill.
To choose the adequate man is a thing, to choose the best moment,another.
Maybe that is the real art of the selection.
My dip would be to give to Bopara its opportunity, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as they suggest the leaves of the tea, he is the one who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring to the refugees of turn to the work -and to the fightagainst Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees of Syria started to arrive to Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiled ones that were kept without cash, without extensions of the visa and to which they expected the city to return to the normality.
Some had even returned to fight against the militants who drove them out of its homes.
In the station of buses of Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of the government composed of a dozen of buses, the terminal was full of refugees of Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria that they killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah to the-Qubaisi, sunita doctor.
"I returned today for what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on the happened in Baghdad and that it is safe now".
"They say that the army of Mahdi stopped killing people", declares, referring to the militia chiíta of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada to the-Sadr, that it ordered its troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim to the Atwani, chiíta of 38 years and professor in the sunita area of Amariyah, returned with its two children because renewing was impossible his endorses in Syria for the regime does not want the Iraqis working in its country.
Its adjacent chiítas in Amariyah called it for telephone to tell the west of the capital that a force associated of EE.UU helped take to Al-Qaeda out of its bastion it, and were urgent it to his returning.
One of the newcomers of Jordan was the head of a sunita tribe and chiíta who had been driven from its home in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad, for an attack of grenades, afterwards who urged the citizens to get up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started a militia anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues".
"That's why I have returned today", declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of62 years.
Many made out that they were attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since the troops of EE.UU consolidated groups of "worried citizens", armed and that work in cooperation with the soldiers of US to defend its neighborhoods.
But many declared that they had returned for the denial of the visas and the shortage of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in the last years.
Salaam to the-Samarrai, of 51 years and father of three children, voice dió to the common suspicion among the exiled ones, that Nouri when-Maliki, the first chiíta minister, asked to the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of the refugees to oblige the people to returning.
More than two and a half millions of people create to have avoided the country because of the sectarian squads of the death.
"We were well even that to the-Maliki visited Syria and urged to the government to stop granting you endorse to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq", said the sunita.
"I can not think that I left it in a government that supports the criminals who set fire to my home afterwards".
Part of the reason of the cessation of the violence is that the sunitas have been chiítas expelled from the areas and viceversa, relaxing the tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees makes the sectarian tensions rise up again and starts the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in the vocational training and it even shines for the international direction of its high schools.
As in all the country, the sarlandeses lack only an educationalfield.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to one not sarlandés that we are not franseses"- that was the motorcycle ironic on if same of the smallest federal state for its cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a big paper in the educational system of the Sarre that in a study of the Institute of the German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
This way, the high schools for tradition have good relations with the adjacent countries.
The university of Saarbrücken was melted in 1948 by thefranseses.
Until today the students can finish its university career with two or three dipolmas here.
For consequence, the procentaje of the foreign students is high, of 15, 6 per hundreds.
However, the number of students original from the Sarre is superior to the average in the high schools. Many of them do not have a bacillerato.
"In the Sarre use is made of the system of the professional education", says Axel Plünnecke, the experte of educational sector in the Institute of the German Economics (IW).
More of every five young does its high school in the Vocational School. Thus, it works out that the Sarre is 7 points for a hundred above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the fan of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offering of the double careers, in relation to the number of population, is the best second in Germany.
In spite of the practical vocational training and an increasing demand, the number of graduates in Sciences of Engineering brought a third down in the last years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre obliged the high schools to do more publicity for the specialities in Sciences of Engineering.
"After the first study "of TREADS, we carry out some reforms in the schools of general education", states a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Like this the government introduced comparative proofs in allthe country.
So that the children start as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr, this does not have any cost. Meanwhile, this model imitate also the other federal estades.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether it has increased the yield of the pupils.
As the report TREADS of 2003, the number of pupils desminuyó of the 29 to 20 per cent postponed in school development.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve a lot as other federalstates.
In Baviera, the pupils know to calculate better.
For disappointment of the sarlandeses, the report TREADS does not compare the knowledge of the foreign languages, even if in this field they could achieve good results.
Even though the sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbors is an obligatory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela there will be another time zone differentto the rest of the world.
On 9 of December the president Hugo Chávez lets modify the schedule in the South American country postponing the average clock hour.
At present Chávez is remaining as a comedian in Spain.
As it has informed the Venezuelan Official Gazette, according to the new law, the hour will pass to less four hours GMT.
This way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things Chávez, as enemy of the United States, justifies its desición saying that the United States were imposing then the duty to the world when changing a complete hour.
Besides, Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breach of the relations with its adjacent country Colombia because of the action with taking of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist said that it would not maintain any relation even with the head of state or with the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe kept being the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it", says Chávez, which is propelling a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide Sunday in a referendúm.
With this reform its power could beextended quite a lot in the country.
The reason of the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe when withdrawing the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said that the decision that took Uribe has offended Venezuela criticizing.
It is also in Spain spoken a lot on Chávez.
A new ringing tone causes sensation in the country: "Why you do not keep silent?", is the sentence that half a million of people have already unloaded.
The King of Spain who felt troublesome for the continuous interrupcciones on the part of the left-wing populists in the last Latin American Summit pronounced this sentence.
In 2007 the decrease of the real wage threatens the Germans.
According to a prediction, this year a decrease of the real wage threatens the German employees in spite of a strong situation.
The experts present a great quantity of reasons for a pessimistic prediction.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans Böckler, the German employees should count in 2007 with an account-real wage lower than the previous year.
"The blame for that is the weak evolution of the salaries, the increase of the value added tax and the tug of the prices of the foods and of the energy", informed to the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn del Instituto de Macroeconomía and Research of the trade cycles.
Also the new burdens of the unemployment insurance can correspond to the employees.
The financial Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that the current situation given, the intention of decreasing the burden of unemployment insurance 3.3% when passing from a year to another, is just and reasonable.
Naturally, the working office does not have to enter again an unpleasant situation, asking for loans and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German social-democratic match.
On Tuesday public that the rate of inflation with the explosion of prices in the sector of foods and the sector of derivatives of oil reached the highest level for 13 years was done.
When comparing the prices with the last year, these are increasing 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
In spite of its atmosphere it is not adapted for the life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that until now had not been posed. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and whirlpools in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter in the Earth.
The investigators already since three decades ago had the suspicion that there could be lightnings in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new proofs: he discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the cayen lightnings of a height of 54 kilometers of a cloud and behind another, it tells Cris Russell de la Universidad of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the lightnings caused the life in the Earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, on its part, had given rise to the amino acids that are the core components of the life.
In Venus it is not like this: if some day were life there, that should be in one of the first states of evolution, explains Sean Solomon de la Institución Carnegie of Washington.
Today, in the surface of Venus there can not be life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times bigger than in the Earth and in the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached under zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolical" cufflink of the Earth, but keeps being a cufflink", said Russell.
The main goal of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer to the question of why Venus, similar to the Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the nineties there were not special missions, alone for research of this planet, the promotion of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important crossing for the research of Venus.
The last results of the research that are going to be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the investigators, underline not only the unicity of Venus in the Solar System.
"This deshows also that the adjacent planets have more common characteristics with the Earth of those that we" had "meant", informs the THAT.
In spite of the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, the investigators discovered in the polar region south also a whirlpool formed by the clouds that he turns more quickly.
This phenomenon reminds the flows of wind in the discharges of terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as it describes an equipment of investigators of Giuseppe Piccioni del Instituto Italiano de Astrofísica Especial and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12.000 kilometers it is almost so big.
This planet also called star of dawn or evening star orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its period of rotation it is slower: a day in Venus it is equivalent at 243 days in the Earth.
Although Venus with its superficial temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble the Earth a lot, the scientists set off from the base that both planets had been formed in the same conditions.
In both planets water that in the Earth stayed in the oceans, but in Venus dissociated in the universe had agglomerated.
Whereas in the Earth the carbon dioxide had been converted in stones of carbon, in Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the meeting of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight among the matches through the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
It criticized indirectly to the German social-democratic Match for its attacks to the Chancellor Federal after the meeting in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, worries about the reputation of Germany and that's why it required that the big coalition finished that fight through the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as A nation divided up", said Koehler to the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed its understanding with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama for Ángela Merkel (Match of the Union Demócratacristiana) in September.
"Although I have a great respect to the difference between cultures, the human rights are of absolute validity for me", said Koehler.
All the world knows that Germany has to act with great balance in meteria of the foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach that received when carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Chancellor Federal did not take the distance from the traditional course of the policy of One China.

Among other things, Steinmeier criticized to the Union for its inoperative policy in the exterior matter.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery provoked great incomprensiones in the Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to To Let Off Steinbrueck (Social-democratic Match), the Minister of Finances of Germany, but besides, according to informative fountains of the magazine "Spiegel", it froze the one strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries called.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded to the Chancellor Federal Ángela Merkel that it recognized this reception of Dalai Lama as an error.
Stating the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that the European politicians received the religious leader of the Tibetans in its official position.
The actions and the words of Dalai Lama proved that he is trying to divide up the Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes also other provinces.

In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance very far from the reality of the Chancellor Federal, proves that the coalition as for the contents arrived to its last point and that nothing else of it has to be waited.
But in that which country lives really the Chancellor?
After its despairing performance, indifferent and without a lot contained in the general debate of the Lower House has to be said: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was done to performances it by having been dedicated repeatedly in foreign policy, the Chancellor refused it with a presumptuous sentence.
It said that that would be a provincial mode and like this showed did to confirm that it does not want to understand what interests the reviewers.
In the Lower House it was declared in an express very clear way to all of them that that reproach was adapted.
Neither a minimum interest, and any type of feeling for the problems of the country could be felt.
But instead of that, Ángela Wolke presented himself this way: a sky-high policy that runs away in the foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything specifically.
An example: the prevention of the climatic change: it was praised very much to itself for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these goals must be carried out here in questions of climate.
In general, this way of being praised to itself- since two years ago the head of the Match of the Union Demócratocristiana has not been able to be allowed so many modesty.
Then he insists on expressions so that an impulse to thepeople arrives.
And this way it damages its public image for the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without leaving for the branches.
But in the kingdom of Ángela Wolke the interior problems are aparencias of little value.
The poverty of the children and the worries about the workers with low salaries?
To how only is dedicated is to talk on that subject using subordinate clauses.
It is impressive how many times he makes a mistake when talking when it is about the supplement for the children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate one sentence more or less good.
It starts to run "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The section attacks.
The two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, did a confrontation in a hot debate of republican presidential precandidates of YouTube and must now fear only a candidate of the exterior part.
The tensions are already from a beginningnoticed among the candidates.
Mitt Romney reproached its opponent Rudy Giuliani for this having converted New York into "a place of shelter for the illegal immigrants".
This, on its part, answered with severe reproaches: "It would mean that its own home was a port for the illegal ones". Giuliani answers to the ex governador of Massachustes saying that he was the one who employed the illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend towards the attacks: as until now the group of republicans does not have a clear favourite, the eight presidential precandidates make use of the debate in the CNN, especially to discredit its opponents.
The small videos of 30 seconds, filmed by usarios of internet that was sent to Youtube, neither have a lot contained.
"With this mode of insulation we leave To Hitler to arrive to the power", that was the reproach of John McCain to its opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on withdrawing the troops of Iraq immediately.
Romney receives also many criticisms on the part of the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to recognizing as it tortures the "Waterboarding" a method of interrogation, when leaving a person to be drowned they simulate its death.
The reactions of the public in the room in St. Petersburg in Flowery show that meanwhile the most important subjects of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on the torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised the conservative values and they denied the rise of the taxes.
Like this it can be seen better where the weaknesses of both favouritesare.
"In that period I made a mistake", it explains Romney remorseful and it asks the people and the public of the television because it has been defensive of the abortion in 1994 for pardon.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know how what to say when they asked him what he thought on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf it governs withoutuniform.

On Wednesday he transferred its mandate of head of the army to its informer Ashfaq Kiyani and this way he accepted the international pressure, especially on the part of the US.
That eight years people afterwards of he seizing power with a bloodless military coup, the ex-general governs the state as civil head for the first time.
With its renunciation to the charge of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf complied with the main condition of the opposition and of the west.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 of November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the attorney general of the state, after the juramiento Musharraf is very soon going to nullify the state of emergency and will comply with the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed state of emergency in the High Court there were many jurists in favor of Musharraf. Last week the High Court of the country refused all the resources before the controversial new choices of the head of the government on the 6th of October.
Meanwhile, in an attack to a convoy of the soldiers in the region Watiristán of the North, five soldiers died and another four were wounded.
According to information of the spokesman of the army a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock return.
The most famous German band of the seventies follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As revival a copy of "Live 1974" that was written in the best period of the band was made.
They were already in those times very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three men to an officialfood caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of itself its cajita, its cables and especially its buttons.
In the middle sitting Dieter Moebius is that it has 63 years and it is dressed with a white shirt.
To its left Michael Rother is of 57 years, which it has its portable computer and the guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years of age, that is very busy with the panel of controls is.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there iseven rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds turn into a part of music.
It seems to the men that this is not troublesome.
Something very thrilling for the passionate ones of Krautrock was the fact that the band Harmonia did music again.
What has to be revealed here is the following: the questions with accuracy have shown that the name of the band echoed in the mind of the people, but something was not special enough after 32 years for the public to miss it so much.
But why the Germans can also not applaud to its alive legend of the seventies?
Especially because the misunderstanding Kautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the industry of entertainment granted a prize of music "Echo" to the members of the band Can 2003 of Cologne for its work of life, in the room the faces surprised of the artists of pop Germans could be seen.
And when Net Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf for und Neu!, all opened the mouth with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother passed the time in the scenario during the concerts of Net Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
The ignorance in its country and the recognition abroad, are a single thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times not achievement a great effect in the public, however, obtained it afterwards thanks to the other ones.
Already a time Moebius ago and Roedelius had done music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first they were due in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Afterwards, for economic reasons, they worked with a company of music in Duesseldorf that was patronizada through a church.
During a time, Rother had a trabajillo in Kraftwerk and worked of guitarist afterwards in the band Neu! It managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother it followed the musicians of Cluster in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, who is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees of the city.
The mode of life was less ideological than in the Comune I, where Roedelius could complain about its position.
That was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
As they say, a day a pennon of association of edge Harmonia de Ottenstein appeared in the garbage, which was to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the nameHarmonia.
The first albúm was called "Musik von Harmonia" andthe second "Of Lux".
Even though the music was calm and simple, the band had financial problems.
The life as artist was not alone to be known to itself.
The CD "Live 1974" was engraved during a concert in Griessem. Somebody remembers that, in this recording almost 50 people took part.
Then Rother expressed its desire to propel Harmonia and to make essays from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand isagainst the habits.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother finished put in subjects of esoterism and guaranteed its existence with albums as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has had more success than was had Harmonia.
The recording in direct of the albúm in Griessmer, by that Groenemeyer has to be thanked.
Its company of music Grienland was put as it puts to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as the alive music.
As the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! it was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as band takes place in the Home of the Cultures of the World in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measuresof the festival Wordtronics.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the punk old man and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade, is also present.
This way, all the influences of Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, onesince it was empty.
The accompanied sentence of Brian Eno with the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to it him partenece the fúturo".
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in anestate.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of photos blank and black, where instruments with cables are seen.
Deep down there are three veterans who started to improvise again.
They do not do anything else to fix the microphones to the organ and to the battery to be able to produce some extraordinary pitches with the help of the devices of effects that had built with his own hands.
At present the electronic music is as well as had to be.
Three people who deepen in the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the address of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere people cough, it is whispered and in a good moment of emphasis it is sung "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock already it was always a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
The origin of the gender was not looked for in the blues, but in the schools of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or avoiding the conventions artistic and social (Cluster).
The one who shouts here "¡68!" he is also right, but Harmonia now preserves the calm.
In the scenario what is already evident is reflected on verywell.
Where does it start and where does it finish themusic?
That can break the nerves to one or give some fast moments of luck away.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are dedicated again to the war in the Balkans.
But they both did not have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot in actions and tirotes or both films are thrilling demasiando.
Richard Gere with its "The Hunting Party"can not help either in this case.
At first there was one good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the criminals of war, keep being hidden in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the war of Bosnia, overdraft again went the actor Richard Gere.
Finally we had lost sight to the best-looking man of the eighties, because nobody wanted to see it after afterwards of its nice papers and of little importance in the films for women and after many press conferences on the Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter is converted in what intends" (Why nowadays do the bonds of the films have to be so long and absurd?).
The film has a marvelous presentation for the sight: deep down, its paper of reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could make, if the destination and the industry of the cinema had not been so compassionate with it. He was a man whose best times of the life they already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of its decay kept until now most of its charm.
"The Hunting Party", in spite of this triumph, together with "Moerderischer Frieden" that it is the German production and this week will also be presented, are to be only one series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be told in a brief way: they are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb of the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that leads him also to his falling in love with it.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the firing, although we are glad the Serbs not being presented once again as the only guilty ones.
The film is as the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without highway, but in situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" it can be investigated, because in fact never there was a good film on the war in the Balkans.
In another moment, with another director and with another author of hyphen (Richard Shepard in two charges), the history on the American reporters in the war that leave to detect a criminal Serb of war called "fox", probably could be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the histories are surprisingly similar: the small equipment leaves twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army can not make and every time it is a journey in madness.
A reason of the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they present us to Simon Hunt, to him to whom they do not leave it to be simply one cynical with heart.
Not, the hyphen foresees also a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian that are going to kill afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive rapidity achieve what could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of heads of the world, which was to capture to the criminal of war and to leave them to the musulmanos Bosnians so that they took revenge on a just form.
It is so badly, that they give desires of appealing to the international court in La Hague cinematica based on the crimenes against logica.
However, the proposito of the film is, in fact, one humanprofondamente.
The pelicula wants to condemn the fact of which Karadi and Mladi esten even free, and stands out that the Americans and the Frenchmen not estan really concerned themselves to intend them, because they have politicos hotfixes among them.
Sometimes what is good and the bad are so similar, so that to one a very famous poem of Brecht is come to him in front.
In this peoma it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the wrinkles gandes of its forehead I see, sharing the feelings with it, that I last is to be bad".
In the films as "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that I last is to be good.
The problem consists not only in the gender of the films of war in the Balkans.
Not long ago in a newspaper he published that all the films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can be added also that never there has been a good film on Africa of the South.
It almost always costs a rule: when a star is put by a region of crisis or through the mine fields, it appears a little like this afterwards as "Rangoon" with Patrician Arguette, "To the other side of all borders with Angelina Jolie or "Sangrientes Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts happened in a brief lapse of time.
They have to pass at least decades until Hollywood films a good film on the holocaust having the film "The list of Schindler" as example.
Some films already need more time. The classic ones as the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in its times were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Nowadays perhaps we know too much on world conflicts, and because of that in our times every killing (Massenmord) comes presented directly in two televisions at home.
And that is because the authors of hyphen do not have the smallest objection (which is necessary for power) in telling good histories.
"Being or not to be" or "The big dictator" were in the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet that so bad was in fact the nazi regime.
Perhaps it must not be been a good person to film a film.
Perhaps people have to be as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its look sarcastic and distant from an artist.
When they asked it about the parallelism between its historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he answered: "That is due only to some things never changing".
The big cities will always be in danger, the men are always going to be murdered cruelly and in Yugoslavia the war will always reign.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism as answer on the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of the policy and economics because he did not request the Olympic Games of the Summer.
Many want to keep fighting by the competitions in the section of aquatic sports.
But Beust remembers that it has to be realistic as itestimates the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, chief operating officer of the chamber of commerce of Hamburg, expressed on Wednesday this renunciation as "not good one for the economic site".
In the last time no other project in the big city encouraged so many motivation as the idea about the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal the political sport impulse at the same level could not keep".
Schmidt-Trenz required from the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday the mayor Ole von Beust maintained its declarations that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Olympic Games of the Summer were not carried out even at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but decides it the German Federation of Olympic Sports, Beust says von in the WELT ONLINE.
He sent the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund) that is waited for at the beginning of December, on the application for Munich for the Olympic Games of the winter of 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought to have up to 2028, from the realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity".
In spite of everything, this dream did not finish forever,Beust said von.
The Federation of sport of Hamburg (HSB) regrets the declarations of von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to request the Olympic Games.
It "is too soon to leave to remove the opportunity, if now the plans are ruined," said on Wednesday Günter Ploß, the director of HSB.
The declaration of the head of the senate that it made in a reception for the general meeting of the German public Federation of sport of the high schools (adh) finds a renunciation of the application contradictory.
There von Beust designated the application for Hamburg for Universiadas of 2015 not as "a substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Alone last week the Federation of sport of the high schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the application.
The Fraction of the German social-democratic Match (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the senate for he not making use of the time that was so valuable for the construction of homes in Hamburg.
"During many years the senate deferred with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of homes", stated Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the representatives of the German social-democratic Match (SPD).
Whereas the SPD always required a planning integrated of Olimpia for the small Grasbrook and afterwards the use of the built homes, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
In that moment, the application for Hamburg for the Olympic Games of the Summer of 2012 provoked a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not the wooden boxes.
The one who relates the Sweden terms and wooden box, thinks in Ikea, but, he, does not think in Andy Warhol.
¿O sí?
At present the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are as the shadow that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the ninety-four Brightness-Box of "type" of this list are false.
That some months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt on the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 of Andy Warhol, the museum Moderna Museet of Stockholm carried out internal research and arrived to deceiving conclusions: the six "Brightness-Boxes", that the ex-director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the museum Modern Museet, are false, and almost one a hundred of the other ones of "Stockholm type", which are in circulation in the market of the international art, also work out.
The prehistory is complicated too much with a confusing relation between the artistic productions and patrocionadas.
In 1964 Warhol it created in New York his first "Brightness-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same exhibition that cardboards of dust of soap "Brightness" had.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of its works of 1968 in the museum Moderna Museet were exposed hundreds of Brightness-cardboard boxes. These Warhol (because of the expenses) did not do, but they were brought directly from the factory of cardboard of "Brightness".
They were not of works of art, but of copies (which were only some objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed producing in Sweden some Brightness-wooden boxes, but were not exposed in the museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times talk now of that almost fifteen boxes, that in that time they entered in the art history and of auctions them as originals of the "Brightness-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized to by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought for more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after which the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén did false declarations that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left them to himself to it.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in San Petersburgo.
In this time Warhol it had already died since 3 yearsago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the museum Moderna Museet, estate of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were fabricated in 1968 in Stockholm investigated six Brillo-Boxes. First they were printed and polished its tight platas with emery and painted them for the oil with the paintbrush afterwards.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without printing directly the tight platas. Besides it is not about the oil paint, but of the acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and they must be eliminated from the official list of Brillo-Boxes de Andy Warhol", says Lars Nittve, the director of the museum Moderna Museet and" adds that if La Comisión de Autentificación "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not arrive to some conclusion, the museum Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibition".
It already in Julio La Comisión de Autentificación announced formally that it accepts these "severe accusations" in which they are boxes of dust of soap.
But since that moment everything remained there in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines the rebel soldiers that had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and had required the fall have been yielded of the president Glory Macapagal Arroyo.
The leader Antonio Trillanes, that it reproaches to the president, the corruption and electoral fraud, said a reporter that could not answer for spilling blood.
The soldiers faithful to the government had assailed the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two welded hundreds were entrenched since some hours in thebuilding ago.
Almost half of them, among them Trillanes, had on Thursday judgment for having tried a coup d'etat in the 2003 that finished with in a failure.
It made use of the negotiations, for suddenly to be able to settle with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police that they had to keep watch it had passed at its ranks and followed its riot.
They entered in the hotel "Peninsula" and required the fall of the president Glory Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops of the government blocked the neighborhood in thesurroundings of the Noble Hotel.
The president called to an urgent session of the Cabinet ofSafety.
Norberto Gonzales, the adviser of National Safety, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"The people are full", said Trillanes.
"We call for the people to pass at our ranks".
The general Danilo Lim, who before managed the troop of elite Scout Reangers, said that in little the other military troops wanted to follow the course.
The big reviewers of government called on Thursday to a great demonstration against the president.
Since months ago its government receives reproachesby the corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a place that attracted all the attention for the riot that was tried against Arroyo.
The raising failed afterwards of near 24 hours per which the army wanted to take part.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been seven attempts at coup d'etat at least against the government chosen democratically.
United Internet will be the biggest stockholder of Versatel.
United Internet assured more of 20 per cent of the actions of the company of telecommunication Versatel.
On Wednesday the company informed that the average price by an action is of 14, 46 euros.
It is had alone 20,05 per cent of the share capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also the options because they increase the financial part morein Versatel.
United Internet informed that with this crossing it wants to speed the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Line of digital subscriber) up.
On Wednesday they already did the assumptions on the entry in the business, that the bank Brendenberg increased its participation to the operator of net of Duesseldorf for 5 per hundreds to the 15,1 per hundreds.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds the bonds of participation for a third member.
United Internet already on the previous day it did to take part to the company of telecommunication Drillisch with almost 10 per hundreds.
Drillisch in the measure of capital increase placed 17,4 million the new shares that have a value of 106,4 million euros.
United Internet has bought millions of actions of the 5,15 of them for 31,4 million euros.
Besides, the companies started with the negotiations on cooperation of commercialization of the DSL-products.
"We strengthen our collaboration", explained the potravoz ofUnited Internet.
Both companies founded a joint company MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet informed that at first, both companies want to be happy with the participation of ten per cent to Freenet and they do not make use of its law, that is, do to take part to 18,49 per hundreds of Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially the participation to the corporation Freenet.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic association finished mid November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last during many months and is not very understandable belongs to the consolidation of the German market of Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet it had 2,9 million customers with a contract of mobile telephone and 1,27 million with a contract of DSL or a complete contract.
Until now the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6,01 per cent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had granted that Drillisch is going toachieve another four per cent.
The law of already buying 18,49 per cent of the society of inversion Vatas was agreed on in August.
