The lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
The paths are deserted pose no problem and operators of remonte-pentes.
The lack of snow deters people to book their stays on skiing in hotels and pensions.
It is always possible to trace Chambers free for all the dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have plenty of hits on our site.
Internet users travel offers, asking prices, but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they call, they call immediately if there is snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin jandura, operator of the spindl.info information portal.
If you want to move the new year of his dreams to špindlerův mlýn, better not too hesitant to reserve.
If you give priority to economies and that the quality of accommodation is that, then we can try to wait a few days.
The hotel to špindler did not propose for the moment of visits a week for new year.
I think they will try one more time to put them, but they cèderont them and will accept a shorter period.
And then the number of free rooms will soon fall, "said jandura.
The agency of tourism ingtours of vrchlabí also proposes more beds free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we want most for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half the houses in our offer.
This is why we have already prepared a few visits to Christmas for last minute cheaper, "said the director of ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The agency vrchlabí tourism can also offer the new year to krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
The 14 days of February go well, stays hivernaux remaining sell moderately.
This year, interest in the winter visits has been negatively influenced by the fact that there has still not like krkonoše.
The people expect that it began to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel horizont to PEC pod sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five per cent.
We have few places for the new year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays in January of Poles and February sells well, too, "advised Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the Central Park jánské lázně is also full of 80 per cent during the period on new year.
Instead, half of the beds are empty at Christmas in the latest jánské lázně hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already 60 per cent of occupation at the moment.
February is a little more low for now, but as soon as the snow is falling, the interest for stays in the krkonoše builds certainly still said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik sporysch.
The hotel of krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there is rain, they should be neigeuses mountain.
But the time should warm up to inform jiří jakubský of the Czech hydrométéorologique hradec Institute.
United States is the mother of wisdom.
It is even comical, effort and hard with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on Afghanistan, that he regarded himself as so simple.
When he ended up leaving smacked his Doctrine supporter expected, it emerged that he reproduces the carbon paper for the Iraqi scenario Bush to three years.
Not content to use in the text itself several times "as in Iraq," he has not hesitated, which is more, to use the title of the speech by Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "a new way forward."
Meanwhile, he has personally criticised the idea of Bush to send reinforcements in a new Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which was issued recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely to successes such as newspapers now do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, he left his successor a final situation much more favourable than might have hoped.
Barack Obama hope in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It is once again the commanders of campaigns, who asked him to an increase in military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley mccristal, which was severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but if a better option, at least he had cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to stamp out the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it had about 10,000.
Which makes the most problems throughout the Obama strategy seems to be its intention to withdraw troops to Afghanistan by 18 months and to finish this whole process within three years. The doctrine of Obama leads to more questions than it does not provide answers.
Many have doubts about the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out for the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and any treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, used to change of leader overnight, according to what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will remain just window-dressing behind which will increase the patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Even the foundation of a 'state quick to act ", which is the aim of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy Obama makes puzzled by his determination.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent to the tumult of the war in order to their "speedy return home" will bring a real miracle.
A political point of view, set a date for withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible since the Taliban see it as an indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that Europeans want to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving to negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to tell their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor is capable of altering radically the situation is the development of events linked to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that sanctions strengthened does not have effects on the Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult question of a resolution of the problem by using military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops to Afghanistan.
Each solution to this kind will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only swept for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to go on a new strategy in case it would be revealed to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive bonuses in cash
The employees senior leaders of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive bonuses this year in cash.
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 leaders main will receive shares instead of money, they will not sell for five years ago.
The measures could be withdrawn from the leaders in case they would take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is as well as leader of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that we must take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the company JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters of this year.
For this year, the total amount of bonuses is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it intends to spend a single fee of 50 per cent bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women got the Nobel Prize in all areas except the physical
Five women, a record number, which received today in Stockholm in the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer from Romania Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the area of chromosomes.
The price of Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.

The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received Friday morning Janota Eduard finance minister, who considered his residence in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted for by the Chamber of Deputies
We believe that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, what is widening the public finance crisis.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim ochvat who told the meeting.
Janota then discuss his office on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget will be subject to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion kronor to the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the parliament has approved Wednesday the proposals from the left on the money transfers and has increased the amount of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of Social Democrats that they would increase by passing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between left and the government, Klaus and the right to disagree that calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the čssd and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as it was voted by members, removes the package of saving measures passed by the government of Fischer and according to stem the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget, but nothing, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the irréfrénable "deficiency" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a consensus of political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is amazing and that the government should call into question its existence in the future.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr nečas told the čtk that the idea of a Cabinet official supported by the čssd, the ODS and the greens is clearly more.
In his reaction, the Prime Minister Fischer has described as "drastic" verdicts.
The head of čssd jiří Paroubek reacted with Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by former government of Topolánek is amazing and it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the čssd called a success the ratification of the state budget for next year.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism that the principal roles are played by American actors, the South Africans claim that the new film in Hollywood Invictus - unbeaten set out in the world many things on the country, its fighting and its success.
The story about sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
American actor Morgan Freeman, rewarded the Oscar, embodies the film on the lives of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the regime racist apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said that it is a 35-year-old Ninety-one Mandela, who asked him to the flesh in the film.
Matt Damon plays another role.
I told him: 'If I want you to embody, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor who is 72 years which has been rewarded for a price for his role in the drama milion dollar baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery itself servant, a US president, the shadow, or even God in the film Evan Almighty, but never someone alive and as important for so many people as Mandela.
The ex-homme of state of South Africa has been jailed 27 years for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years ago.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus Latin is a word meaning unbeaten and this is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak with him.
The film tells the true story of joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and still divided racialement and economically after apartheid.
It is sure to join its people by the sport and decides to join the rugby players who are among the "outsiders" in the world.
The South African team will move forward in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked a few years to bring the history of Mandela on big screen.
I had no other purpose except to play this role to bring it closer to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me this was, of course to speak with him
The actor said that if he and the international policy were in the same region, it would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important for him was to shake hands.
I realized that when I say "the hand, I get your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard Middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I arrived at the door of the home, he was open and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much larger in the film ".
Despite the differences between the actors and models, Invictus under the leadership of the filmmaker Eastwood has received positive opinions and even talk about ambitions for the Oscar nomination.
The criticism of films envoy Todd McCarthy, the newspaper Daily Variety summed up his discretion in these words: 'This is a very good story, a film very well done. "
In the films on the site RottenTomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 per cent of assessments.
The mystery of the Norwegian has been solved: The Russians tested a rocket
There has been a strange phenomenon ring of unknown origin above Norway.
The Ministry of Defence Russia has recognised that yesterday to have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile, not far from the borders from Norway.
The launch, however, has been a failure and the missile "Bulava" which was originally scheduled for the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence is repeated in the tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the successful test flights.
Most of the time, is Bulava has not disappeared, or it was damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as the "missile that not."
A missile that is not
The 13th test took place at the beginning normally.
It is only at the end of the flight that there was again the damage on the equipment.
This is clearly the driving force behind the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" has disappeared from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely torched a boat on the move and immersed
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object exactly has probably been by a "Bulava" flawed.
The rest, the Norwegians have not doubted a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals to argue that this time, we cannot talk absolutely of failure.
The two first floor of the rocket has resisted and the damage has hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have been failures on the first floor.
Even if none of the test launches has gone smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence think that only six to 13 have been failures.
The success rate of almost 50 per cent fills the general optimism and they say is always a day "Bulava 'fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclear cores hypersoniques a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary fetissov has signed up to 51 years ago a contract for a year with the CSKA Moscow

The former world champion and Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will reach out to his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will make its entry probablementdéjà during the match Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, which ended his career to 40 years in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is regularly leads and agrees to help the team.
We have yet to settle a few details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey nyemtchinov, quoted by the agency APS.
It was not said whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will not only one match.
I think fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mindset of the other players, said nyemtchinov.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The leadership of the Hyundai plant in nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is because of overtime to frequent the trade unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr vaněk the plant Hyundai has confirmed.
The leadership wants to be put even agree with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our plan of production, it is essential, which is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there would have two teams, said vaněk.
The site sedmička.cz has indicated that the company has offered a bonus 400 Czech crowns for employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded has also afterwards for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for hours.
Or they receive the extra for hours, or they can put a leave of replacement on 28 December and extend their new year celebrations aindiqué vaněk.
In addition to that all employees here on Saturday will receive compensation for the transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that the additional hours were the most urgent and the warmer in the comments and the demands of unions and employees who have voluntarily stopped production last week, the management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for December, said vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in most of their eight hours.
The unions will cancel the state to strike after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between the leadership of the car factory and the unions should take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr kuchař said Wednesday that they were prepared to stop the state to strike if an agreement on their demands and signing a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers have begun spontaneously on strike because of continuous hours.
They were protesting against the poor conditions of pay and so-called bizutages.
The leadership fought with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to fill the imperatives of production of cars.
During the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions have also asked for employees who have stopped production are not subject to sanctions.
The trade unions demand for society to reduce the time spent in overtime.
They want this year a reward of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for them.
The car plant Hyundai of nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It began series production last year in November.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
The Czech discovery: a substance that works on the HIV virus as "hard-working people."
A team of scientists Czech and German is testing new combinations that could slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantages of the substance improved is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to medicines.
This is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as hard on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
Nevertheless, we can prolong radically the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
The result, however, a number of side effects.
The repression of this increase for the development of what we call the virus strain on which drugs do have more effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way in a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are a collection on boron, hydrogen, and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all the medicines used to date and therefore they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved" on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their routes on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-step structure: two cages in the walls are trained by the atoms on boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metallic atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The protéase HIV is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the protéase HIV there would not rise of mature infectious particles from the virus.
If you stop the protéase HIV, it will stop the spread of virus in the body of the patient, say researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochimie of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a number of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short link, which is then systematically altered.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variations resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as clinical medicine, but it is not diminishing the versions resistant against which the current medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other changes chemical compounds are so interesting to examine more to move towards the development of effective medicines against HIV, says pavlína řezáčová, director of the Laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochimie and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Science.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS is the Fischer, who denies
The president of the ODS (the Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called "amazing" the budget approved for next year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer would threaten its existence.
The prime minister described the connection of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyse.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr nečas said that the idea of a Cabinet official supported by the čssd, the ODS and the Green Party did not clearly.
According to nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend to the chamber of deputies in the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or whether it is to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats compared to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified on Wednesday the budget for 2010, but with the proposed changes to the tune of approximately 12 billion included in the left.
The House has increased the money for salaries of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The complaint from the government against the proposals of Social Democrats was the fact that they started passing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, obeying the desire of the government as a modified budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
That disappointment.
The finance minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with Prime Minister after its passage in government.
He said while he wondered if it would remain in office.
His disappointment about the budget negotiations is the reason.
While Fischer decides to continue the fight against the budget deficit, nečas believes that representatives of čssd, which have forced changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he resign if the Congress ratifies the other laws, increasing the deficit, such as those that affect the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the head of government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing wrong, said in a statement Topolánek text for the United States.
He pointed out that the deputy ministers from some ministries to claim top 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the fight against the amount of public finance deficit, "it is entirely logical and reasonable that it is based on the majority of the left which is currently in the house."
That said, it must not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I was not considered and once again will be the next day then I will, said since the House to journalists, Defense Minister Martin barták, elected to the government out of the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has increased in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back to the prime minister.
Nečas stressed that the ODS probably would have voted on Wednesday against the budget changes if he did not specifically asked the House Democrats to allow the budget vote.
We do not have the feel of orphans, there is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been accusations from the president of the party in the house or in the country in negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that would follow in the months would be a bolchévisation house and destruction of all that was positive, sprung Topolánek in person.
According to the new hours of the čd there will be less trains for the same charges.
The Czech railways will eliminate or reduce from 13 December some regional express trains or less responsible and instead would increase some others.
Full coverage of the day will come into force of the new hours of two per cent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the tariffs and the reduced tariff.
For example the inhabitants of the region in Ostrava who will have more connections to the capital, the railways will add a rowing Pendolino.
Instead, Express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - písek - budějovice Pivo, the direct line Prague - letohrad will be drastically reduced.
Regionally, the largest decrease in shipments to the region of hradec králové eight per cent in total, however, Prague and its environs may welcome an increase.
Two trains at night on the line Prague - tábor Pivo budějovice - are also cancelled and the movement of a few express trains on the line Prague - písek - Pivo budějovice will amount to only a few days in the week.
Among the major changes, you can see the introduction of a new direct line of milovice in Prague: For the moment the inhabitants of milovice must change to Nad nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth of the system of suburban Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Nad nad Labem and milovice.
The disparity in the capital will have their final destination at the station chief in Prague (Praha hlavní nádraží).
The čd will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to šumperk / jeseník will leave by intervals of two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino up in Bratislava on 13 December.
The bill this year for the railways regional: 200 million kronor.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the railways next year in all four billion kronor to settle the losses visible, the same amount this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will take up nearly three billion.
This year are regional trains 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year.
The railways like the system, which also explains that they do not have resorted to a higher price of the vast majority of transport.
The changes will affect only the notes of a day čd net and the Internet at lower prices eliška notes.
For passengers without a card to reduce the price of čd net increase of 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eliška will become dependent on the journey, while there was valid between the cities of a region in the choice and was in a single rate of 160 kroner.
The rebels Filipinos are attracting more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some pupils in primary school and their teachers.
This is the AFP agency that has informed, but who spoke to the origin of 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as teachers.
The hijacking took place in the province of Agusan del on.
There are reports that about 19 rebels have used hostages as human shields during a flight to the police.
The local negotiators are trying to find an agreement for the release of hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (PPC).
According to the AFP agency, the police has pursued the kidnappers following the violence caused when a settling of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the elections of the administration of the governor there avait30 journalists.
The governor of this province south of the Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influence of Ampatuan.

They have, however, renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood movie of Clint Eastwood arrives in American cinemas in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title Czech Invictus: neporažený), and narrae part of life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of fighting against apartheid world-famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who has been chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, the return of critics and the public can be heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela, it was born on 18 June 1918 to mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he has achieved the Sakharov Prize for his freedom, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
It was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations as it is presented at a time when part of South Africa is in full preparations for the football World Cup, and because the media are troubled by disturbing news about the rise of racial conflict and discrimination of the inhabitants of the part of the black majority in power.
According to the agency Pa, reactions to the new film is at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the principal roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, taking its own terms, proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role of long years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met Nelson Mandela to be said - recover his energy, he said during the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we can remember via the film the personality and the message of Nelson Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it affects each individual, he added.
Wearing the shirt of the national team of rugby?
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room which has given its creation to the people depicted the defender South African human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman is trying to during the film to pick up two racial groups of people long divided and even that Nelson Mandela in 1995 he got swimming between the national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been widely cheered fourteen years, mainly from the public and White has been recognised by the white population.
Hope that the Football Championship will be able to unite people once again as one nation, said the player of the rugby Chester Williams, who was in 1995, the only 'black' of the national team.
It remains to see if the tense situation of South Africa will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical as recently confided in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson fan of rugby, which has fled to Britain.
The Championship starts on 11 June 2010.

Jančura will sue for libel against three chiefs of the čssd
Radim jančura, owner of student agency will file today for defamation complaint against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal good soldier švejk region of south Moravia, against Radko martínka region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin tesařík.
Jančura said in dvacet minut of radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt of society to exploit the railways regional in some regions.
All regions, however, have ended up signing long-term contracts with the railways Czechs.
All three have attacked and claim that the fine people, while there has only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the railways in the Czech Republic which is not true because we know the price of railways Czechs who have been signed last week.
So we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society student agency, said jančura in radiožurnál.
Similarly, he said have evidence that no region has been in agreement with the European law.
We are preparing for that a complaint to the European Commission.
The good soldier švejk consider filing a complaint from Mr jančura represents the continuation of its media spectacle of free publicity for his company and for him.
Of course I am prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other chiefs to do likewise.
I assume that this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr jančura who manipulate public opinion and is using the false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, says the good soldier švejk
Jančura has already been informed last week that it will invest a few million kronor in an advertisement which will include the steps against the regions.
He said to radiožurnál that it will stop the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the new year.
He has stated that the campaign will target the corruption at large.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech railways to the exploitation of rail links to a command of about 150 billion crowns without bidding.
According to jančura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to jančura threats of a member of the čssd.
The only threat was that if it does not stop, you could lose our licences to buses.
He presented himself as a member of the čssd, I do not know who it is but I would not say his name, said jančura today to radiožurnál.
The vaccination against the pneumocoques will be free and voluntary
The vaccination against the pneumocoques overturn the current old habits in January.
It will be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
The voices, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against the pneumocoques culminated.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines the maximum price for vaccines that will pay the health insurance.
Analysts also see clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against the pneumocoques charge.
The condition is that they still have not been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay at home the following vaccination.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated children against the pneumocoques.
Yet parents footed 1,600 kroner, or more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 million kronor in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that children would not vaccinated.
Until now the state was spent about 500,000 kronor a year for any vaccination for children.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the "package Janota."
The pneumocoques are the cause of sore ear average but also serious infections, whose sore the way it has racked its brains and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by infections pneumocoques.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
Vaccination will be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible mandatory vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by the insurance and voluntary.
For example, president of the Association nahlas Rudolf kalovský has indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The Association promotes long vaccination against the pneumocoques.
In an international conference in which our association has taken part, experts have not been really happy that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
Another side, we are pleased to have achieved at least this.
I think it is a direction that we now need to follow, said kalovský.
But the health ministry does not change the process of vaccination against the pneumocoques.
We are definitely not for the moment, said spokesman Vlastimil sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana cabrnochová, president of the company specialised paediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction in times of vaccinations in the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination, "said, however, cabrnochová.
Experts estimate that next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
The vaccination against the pneumocoques marks a break because it is the first vaccination in children, which is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance companies should free up funds for the prevention, they save on any future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This is linked to the concerns of paediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy the vaccines by insurers, doctors are receiving the same way that other products of vaccine supplied by the state.
Some members feared that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the money for health insurance. "
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance them back.
According to estimates, the individual paediatricians will invest nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, according to cabrnochová.
We always them.
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle Deloitte.
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, 'why the French do not like the headscarf "(2006), a study elegant and well documented on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book Bowen presents a synopsis of a broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, it would not only know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and colleges that are now in France this Quem. Bozen calls "Muslim" spaces for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well to listen and replicate the debates between teachers and pupils on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim must marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
The development and gay rights should be taught the young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-musulman?
A Muslim could use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the everyday life, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and other intellectuals, unknown to the public, except, perhaps, Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of Islam as French or European.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia which of our days are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
I Bowen believes that the values of Islam and secularism, the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite Guardian if muscle-flexing of secularism) are really committed to diversity.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to be historic compromises with the secular Republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of the core values".
Islam can be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The view the world's darkest
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than anywhere else on the planet.
The ice that the content is starting to melt at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas shipments and fishing are in new waters open, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrateur, painted a natural history of the symbol of the North, the polar bears.
Who knows the history and complicated political of whale, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were doing their evidence in the white bear hunting.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, courageous yearning for 14 years ago which had to fight the tip of his musket-shape is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young oursons, captured when they swim alongside their mother, just killed, is caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early twentieth century, a famous was 75 bears.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in liberté. climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green as a result of algae that drove in his fur.

Mr Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by the hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, in America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Inuits in motoski use of powerful fusilsd' assault to drive their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters further north of these two nations of the hunt for the ice will stay longer.
In his new book, "after the ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor in New Scientist, offers a clear summary and frightening to the science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the océanographes cannot spot the exact speed of change.
It is not due to try.
Late nineteenth and early 20th, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of ice.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped changes in sous-celle-ci relief.
The surveillance satellites and the probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Mr Anderson looking at the World extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice formed by the nets of brackish water pressure by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the microscopic marvels contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the demise of the ice, scheduled for 2013 and 2050.

The Marines, one of the 6,000 people who have tabled kronor on the graves to Arlington
The first class de' Angello Robinson, 19 years, has made a trip to seven hours by bus to lay a wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson to Jacksonville in North Carolina at the cemetery Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to welcome the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months where we will be sent, we will be for them, said Robinson on the subject of fallen soldiers.
If it happened, I want someone to do the same thing for me is why I am trying just for show of respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be assembled on Saturday morning to submit kronor on the graves of veterans, in various sections of the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington in Maine, has launched the celebration and other people have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the graveyard for Arlington ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, are each year the journey, stopping in various cities on their way, to hold the celebrations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (the crown in America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16 million kronor on the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enarkansas charge in the Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial for victims of the Flight 93 of United Airlines to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the foundation Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen hunt, 70 years, of Westminster, said it had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a military career, died.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for it, it was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a grave family.
Wrapped up in several layers of winter clothes, volunteers walked between the grasslands and hills extent of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen the graves old, dating from the first and second world war, as well as the Vietnam War because they are not too often visited the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was of optimism, while children were playing and couples were held by the hand, wearing the crown of pine costs on the graves brains.
Each round Crown had a dark green colour, with a small knot red butterfly on the high.
Close, was silent on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumés.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 kronor to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
People cry not hiding, others pray and families and friends back in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others look to see the small white and black information cards, descended to Earth wet for those whose graves has not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on the grave of his son.
It is part of Zanesfield in Ohio and had led eight hours to come to collect on the grave of Sergeant of Navy gunnerydavid Shane Spicer, died in battle in July.
No one should never forget thanks to what we are free … my son has paid for it, she said.
"long after that I have gone, I want someone remembered."
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who was being distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the foreign ministry.
The National, which has not been identified, working for alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, trying to access the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific allegations were not made public, although under the law of Cuba, a Cuban citizen or a visitor can be arrested under the pretext to be 'dangerous'.
All the self-styled revolutionary activities, including protests moderate and writings criticism, the risk of arrest.
The anti-gouvernementaux graffiti and the words are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers is increasing, led by Yoani Sánchez, commentatrice popular who writes frequently on the way are husband and it is monitored and harassed by the government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive prizes but authorisations have always been refused.
The detention of a US citizen may increase the tension between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration is pursuing a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times, on Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as release political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although it is of consumer goods and new e-mail in a country or the average wage of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are used primarily for text messages or for a conversation about 15 minutes a day of earnings.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in the luxury hotels and visitors in the country and in some buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must supply their name in government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, keen to press the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- providing free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas Program of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a report with the freedom to Cuba, called "new Castro, Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government is often a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries are beginning to get a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities are preventing a plot to send troops in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have noticed an organisation supposed to prepare a plan to send five men in Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped this would remove a significant network of recruitment agencies of terrorists who are plundering the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
Investigators have said they have always fished for a living person insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah which invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments approving the waves terrorists on the video site YouTube on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to join the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Secret Service Pakistanis who has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had not managed to convince the commanders of al-Qaida that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha banned from the mountains northeast become a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered agents infiltrated.
This is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that men were determined and they are still trying to obtain the necessary permissions for entry into the camps of al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruitment agencies in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important in determining the people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the American intelligence services have been for priority to infiltrate the men in the network al Qaeda.
The recruitment agencies of the organisation are playing the role of gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the American potential recruits are being studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their access to American targets, and the value propagandaire.
However, Kohlmann Evan, an expert from the foundation NEFA based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in the people that they accept as the American intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow its model of recruiting as many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is more and more this on Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen to request a "for climate action."
Tens of thousands of Protestants have market in the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater action on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of Congress Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 police estimate.
This event has gone relatively smoothly, although a small number of activists masked has switched on some explosives near a set of government buildings, Centre- city.
On the day that little has happened during the talks on climate sponsorisées by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying there is no Planet B "and in Spanish, saying" the land said it has had enough '.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the homeland of his mother, Peru, it has opened the eyes on the problems déchirants facing the country because of the impact of climate change is happening already. "
This is one reason why I decided to join the great works -- to get the word and appeal to the leaders of the world to make decisions right, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be taken, it is not possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the Bella Centre and said it had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of knives in their pockets.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the Bella Centre and said it had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of knives in their pockets.
According to a passing who requested anonymity because of its involvement in talks on climate activists who were wearing masks and black clothes, sparked a number of explosives near the main channel in Copenhagen that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They caught near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions".
Has the inside the palace of Congress, the people were gathered around television screens to follow the lead throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to revive the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China on climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he said in English ", in fact, this is something I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I cannot hear what happens outside".
He observed that the march could be harmful or useful, according to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
Furthermore, " You can also say they disrupt the talks or they are damaging to the freedom of others. "
The results of tests show the differences between the races tenacious
The federal report last week on the results in maths has made a good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the last two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (national assessment of progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and white, both local and national.
The results means children whites of Grade 4 (CM1) to washingtond.c. have increased over the past two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their schoolmates African-American, increased by just three points, 209 to 212.
The gap in achievement has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (fourth) remains generally steady, falling just one point of 245 to 244.
The result means the White has not been included in the test results because the sample was not important enough.
The survey over a period of six years is not encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (CM1), when the first report NAEP district was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference is only just 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising hailed by the head of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by the white students who were already good things.
It would mean that we have high the gathering in the elements on the high costs, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. voice, a non-profit group that defends the equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), a member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter was in grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the style of management of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs, and I respect him.
But what is frightening is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the district should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading system, which the pupils of class to end the cycle Elementary and early college who have not included the foundations of the Reading earlier in their journey at school and who are lagging behind their peers.
Every day, the programme of mathematics, for kindergarten classes (Mother) to grade 6 (sixth) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, as they have been put in place in the district by the former head Clifford Janey must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply do not believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions with these pupils of lower level than the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with fewer good results in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California who studied the results of tests of the cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to the schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can have political consequences that stand in this important program.
But the problem, of course is that as the other superintendant schools, it is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our school districts, so that all families regardless of where they originate, should be confident that their children can get an excellent education.
Now, Superintendant Janey schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a key ingredient to reduce the gap of success étaitla length of traditional public schools, currently 180 days in the District of Washington to compete with the charter schools.
It should get about 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a "starting point" to achieve an increase in the next contract.
To make higher education, a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long sifflement.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years ago in fall and cligne one point of view at the sight of columns, facades of bricks and leafy grasslands.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school, àel El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in Grade 8 (fourth) of the group tried Gettysburg where school fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less than a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
'This is where I am going to study! is Graciela think who would like to study medicine, while the guides the headed towards the entrance to the Office of Science.
Youpi, really? they songeuse when he identified the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had completely into the message: The question is not whether you are going to university.
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit the university system that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the school -- a notable success if you consider that both of their parents, immigrants, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed the school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they open the way generations who will play an important role in the workforce.
The researchers who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high to their children and who are finding ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with the American schools.
The programmes of mentorat also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- especially if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latin American students.
We must think to offer a support network for these children, from nursery to the school.
The federal program, which funded the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the ERG up (prepare you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organise the programme to prepare for the university which started when students from families on low incomes are in middle school (College) and continue until the end years of school.
Since 1999, the programme was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going to university, according to the Department of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements brokered by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with the foreign oil companies suggests that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry in Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have left with an interest in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only had set an auction has lost.
Two American companies have received contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies are of Asian and European companies, paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer was made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, on coordinated bombings, on Tuesday, and political instability while the US military troops withdraw have slowed down the American oil companies, preventing them to go with more force in Iraq has the third largest oil reserve, gross of the world, say analysts.
The American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose costs were significantly lower labor and were more willing to take risks because they had not to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, had strong ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and gave it their technical advice, have left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has outbid on contracts more than other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam jihad, spokesman of the oil ministry.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The company to submit pré-sélectionnées auctions have made offers which were then compared the price per barrel as the ministry has agreed to pay to move the production above current levels for each area.
One of the main organisers of Al Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile has struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organisers of the operations of al-Qaida, this week, said Friday the American authorities of counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn.
Al-somali Saleh was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of rockets fired into their car, on Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said the missiles were fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was struck, said a member of the Secret Service Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone to Miran Shah.
The authorities have said that the local militant suspects fled into place and were quickly captured what was left "bodies completely blown apart".
It was impossible to local authorities to check the identity of the victims, but the two representatives anti-terror Americans unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organisers, military officials who ran Al Qaeda terrorist operations of the group out of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to hold the plots in the world, said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this was probably the conspiracies of attacks against the US and Europe.
It has followed the instructions of great leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority has said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-qaida' and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known of the great American public, but it does not diminish the threat that it is for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack has killed Najmuddin jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the probing Israeli unmanned CIA has fallen since the summer, about six operations for months to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site is tempered by a non-profit group.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have moved to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The UN special envoy to Kabul to cut
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy has said he supported the increase, but he expressed his concern about the timing of the US for a withdrawal of troops who would start in 18 months and that would force the other governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, sending the wrong signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone conversation in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other powerful military to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but that it would simply the commitment that he had made to his family, in March, not to spend two years ago in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said it was better start to look for my successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there had been a gap of two months between the start of my predecessor and I arrived.
According to representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is a citizen italo-suisse recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously headed the operations of UN peacekeeping.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and hide the evidence of a massive vote fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of éléctions."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to co-ordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leaders of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, said that the heavy UN employment rules hinder its ability to bring new talent.
The rules are such that I was unable to recruit one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "serious additional sanctions on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking at a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit by a week in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has defused the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of in such an outcome.
One of the things that I choose the most is that if I learned a thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has said that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a "package of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer greatly on these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement of the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face the consequences "probable" if it does not reduce its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful.
In the Geneva talks, on October 1, he said it would take the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its stockpiles of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement means to develop a confidence on both sides and win time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be removed the attempts of agreement, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think the inflexibility of Iran with some of the proposals of the international community where they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join on what they had not considered, in terms of serious additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31, as the deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before he turns to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'increased sanctions ".
In a statement on Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran in the United Nations condemned what it calls "the allegations baseless" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to get a long-term satisfactory solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late on Friday, met this morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region in order derencontrer Kurdish leaders of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
The tensions persist between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the share of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid delays of American plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 thousand to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to ease the anxiety of Kurds to withdraw pending. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will protect your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
You will not leave you. "
In China, a change of direction ageing
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by displays of propaganda, "the preaching to the Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby, it is a grave ever".
They have so far learned the lesson that the authorities of the government of Shanghai, raised by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more of a child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: Never.
We have already given all of our time and all our energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31 years ago, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good joues and spoiled, dubbed the "Little Emperors', a crisis of the population is threatening the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple for six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, although it is envisaged that the number of residents of 60 years and more bursts, 16.7% of the population by 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
That imbalance is even worse in the coastal cities rich with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Lingli Xie, director of the local population and Shanghai fit planning commission (Committee on the Shanghai Municipal population and family planning) said that the fertile couples should have babies to 'help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labor in the future ".
Shanghai is about to become "too old - but not as rich, however - that the developed countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual reduction
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is undoubtedly the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced the abuse in implementing this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced the pregnant women to a second child to have abortions.
Moreover, many couples have resorted to selective abortions, leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of towns, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already children unique -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans.
Xiaochun Qiao, a professor at the Institute of Population Research Institute of Research on the population), at Beijing University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such that allow couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai, became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage the births.
In no time, the posters urging families to have a single child have been replaced with copies of regulations retailer that has the right to have a second child and how do the authorization request.
The government of the city sent from the family planning and volunteers to meet with couples in their home, and slipping leaflets under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to take more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the answer has been disappointing.
Disappointing answer
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples seeking a second child following the launch of the campaign, the district more urban reported that there was no change.
The huinan with a population of 115 million inhabitants, for example, receives four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only around 165 thousand -- slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, responsible for the committee of family planning in the caolu in Shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to cater to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, said that they loved to have two children and they are legally allowed.
But as many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Westerners wrongly that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, said Yang, an engineer in construction, whose wife is pregnant for seven months of the first child.
This is true, we just lucky to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
This is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, chief human resources, said she wanted an only child because it was a itself. "we were the centre of the family and had used that everyone is looking to us."
We were not used to take care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen zijian, 42 years and owner of a society of translating the said more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which restrict the birth rate, he says, it must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years ago, grew up seeing their parents fight in the first time China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, he says.
Even one child asks a lot of time his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of his social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "when your child has only 9 months, you need to write her CV for a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are ready to this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to do too much sacrifice.
The UN group plans to plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the UN - characterised so far by earmarking disorganized, and mutual recrimination -- came back in the spotlight on Friday, because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases in the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shoulder most of the burden, in the near future.
The text that could provide the foundations of a final political agreement on regulating greenhouse gases, pointed out the remaining barriers, he has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations who lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world coming next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special working group, the text does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to cope with climate change, and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for the key issues, including how the economies developed and emerging economies new could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
It gives a great flexibility in the process, said John coequyt, àwashington representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, studied a text of negotiations to 180 pages to concentrate on what has described the executive secretary general on climate change to the UN, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines to an agreement in which the industrial nations should reduce collectively their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and droughts or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same wrangles verbal occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Envoy Todd Stern, representative of the US negotiating climate has rejected any discussion, forcing the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration has been there two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also lamented that the text is not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outsiders.
Stern has made his comments an hour after the Chinese deputy foreign affairs, He Yafei has said that the principal negotiator, is a lack of "common sense", or was "highly irresponsible" for having said earlier this week that the US does not help financially China to combat climate change.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects appeared at the time in the third world and between the world of industrial and emerging economies.
The battle now is more relevant to the rescue of individual economies that saving the planet, with China and America was on their respective duties while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries the most influential ignorant of the scientific need to act more boldly.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, which is also advise on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of those countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated they would continue to put the pressure for a treaty forcing legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the negotiations will get at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States comprising 43 states, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the unity of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states has "put political pressure on the political process complete", in part by what they are now unified and demand in emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while the delegates were focussing on the fact that they must solve most of the issues pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
High level officials such as the Indian environment minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy took their plane and ran in the office of the Bella Center to attend meetings behind closed doors and conferences of information in order to make claims which will be considered during the following week.
The real picture of the rally -- during which 13,000 people come in and out of the palace of Congress every day -- activists Guitare players with late-night entertainment mocking of countries that they believe will reveal that the proposals are made and distributed on paper, rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all the ministers are here and not later on Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president of global politics of Conservation International.
The trucks arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the syndrome on Monday.
Have 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle breaking through the night to signal the start of a train that marks a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train the country reached 225 km / h, while it stretch of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, cover the 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes in the first commuter train javelin outside London.
It hopes that the new service will allow Britain to include an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes, lost cities, suburbs will become successful, the Times of business travel will be far less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce the national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten million pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of dangers to the environment may slow the high-speed lines in Britain.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
It will get a detailed map the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to West Midlands will be established in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres final journey.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network, go to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The privileged options are being put forward in a format in which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will, in two at or near Birmingham, with one arm towards the west of Pennines àmanchester and Scotland and another going toward the northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cut across Scotland.
"It seems to be the best option of performance has said a professional of the railways.
When it is finished, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a trip to an hour.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km / h, making the UK grid the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line in London, Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Having given the constraints of space, is due to an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry say that only St. Pancras International or Euston offer this option.
Lord Adonis announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but more lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built by one.
The trains will first have to drive out of high-speed lines on the rails exist in the north of Birmingham, retaining the lengths of travel between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This appears to be the best to ensure a way of trains, a reference point for the revolution of the railways.
Taxpayers can repay the loan of 75 000 per for the Tory Orangerie
Alan Duncan, a member of parliament Tory, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a Orangerie that it has built in his house in his constituency.
The head of the party which has been demoted by David Cameron to have complained that members of parliament were kept, has increased its loan of 75 000 per to build an extension in Oak to its second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Legg, making a controlling spending. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer and more simple."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is owner of a house in two upstairs in a village of his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
Nearby homes were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a hairdresser and a room to eat, but the bureau salary claims that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a véranda at home, describing in its plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbours describe it as a "véranda for fun."
It was not asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of the privileges and standards of the Commons, on its loans.
The committee was cleared last month in charge of breach of rules, after an investigation into its spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal certainty of the loan of 271.406 per of his property in London in the home of his constituency that he has bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was approximately 1.4 per month of interest on loans up to March last year.
In April, its applications have increased more than 1.8 per month.
Interest rates on the loan RBS Mr Duncan has not been changed at this time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of 75 000.
The standard variable interest rates RBS happened to 7,94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, nothing since then.
The latest publication of the Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1.250 GBP in May.
Mr Duncan has lost his post as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in coverage has allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the scandal of spending.
"It is now, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" m e ….
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could ask sacrément more, but I did not. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former job as a negotiating oil, has started to explain its spending in May, after it emerged that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the Bureau of charges that it "could be considered excessive."
An activist has created a hole in the form of £in the lawn of Mr Duncan, in protest after it was revealed that he had asked 4000 per for three years ago.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the office of expenses and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of a cop-out or development or use the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules allowed, etc.
This could not be clearer and more simple. "
True, you all see the Advent calendar of Brighton
The beach in Brighton have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of church alternative that encourages the spiritual exploration of creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cab for every day of December, using as theme songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while the visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, 5.30 p.m. at 6.30 p.m. each day with patés and wine hot served free of charge.
The songs of Noel chosen so far include "I saw three ships, O come, O come, Emmanuel and the first Christmas", for which the cabin is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years, an assistant marketing of Hove TV, is a priest unpaid from the diocese of Chichester and director of beyond.
He said: "We want that religion is closer to the people in a society post-chrétienté.
"As a church, why do we expect that people come in an old building odd? it seems that the church should be closer to the people and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of Advent calendar in the cockpit Beach came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a place so creative and emotional and we are trying to experiment and try to represent it through spirituality. "
Late payments: anger of the actions of prison guards.
The prison guards unions have called on Friday in the 'efforts "to demand the payment by the new year celebrations of premiums and overtime and the payment was rejected in January for budgetary reasons.
Fo-pénitentiaire (2nd syndicate of overseers) has asked the personnel who will not be in service to show on Tuesday morning before the prisons and the "block" to denounce the theft of their due. "

I know of efforts by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writing the minister of justice in this letter.
I asked the leadership of the prison administration to put in place without delay a package of measures to ensure that this situation created a bad review of the number of hours does not recur in future, says Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The pay of December will be thin, except for the personal direction with the infamous premiums of functions and objectives, bemoaned the UFAP / UNSA, for whom "the budgetary constraints have good back".
It is a pure scandal, has incensed the union Interregional fo Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and meetings".

As we increase our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is unfortunate to dare to take the money of the staff, believes the cgt-pénitentiaire Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some less badly off than others.
But in any case it is not, has seen the secretary-general of the UFAP, Jean forget.

Hummel Chad, the lawyer of the director of "pianist," has denounced before three judges of the court of appeal of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I am calling for the abandonment charges here and now, said Mr Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back '.
According to him, the Judge Rittenband -- died since -- would have been discussed before his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have said that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, Wanted and Desired), the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr Wells had finally declared the end of September had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In case the court refuses to abandon the prosecution, Mr Hummel has called for holding a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The charge has also reiterated the case already developed in the first instance, namely that no surrender charges could be seriously considered as a Roman Polanski did not intend to stand before the court.
The filmmaker, who is 76 years, had fled the United States in 1978, before the imposition of her sentence for "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a minor for 13 years.
It has never set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, has said that Roman Polanski must be there to be at the hearing ".
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only (Roman Polanski) but also other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Mrs Asayama.
For it, the filmmaker "calls a favour to the court, in which his authority."
One of three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- has said it "that there were other alternatives to the flight".
Mr Hummel was not only to ask the abandonment of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of the victim, Samantha Geimer, has also called for, once again, the end of prosecution.
Pointing out that its user cannot be harassed at every event of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this piece can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough. "

After more than two months behind bars, it was placed under house arrest in his summer cottage of Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said Friday his son David on his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he had to be by his father in hospital for several days.
The new are very positive.
It is very strong, it happens very well, told the press David Hallyday to exit the plane that brought in Paris shortly after 13h00 local (9 p.m. GMT.
The son of singer, the air relaxed, ensured that he was going to make "very quickly" to the hospital cedars-sinaï Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernie discale on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason for comfort, to prevent suffering and be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors in the hospital cedars-sinaï Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernie discale on 26 November in Paris.
The singer has had to be réopéré into the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries resulting from this speech.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning French around Los Angeles school where their daughter Jade, to attend a school spectacle, saw a photographer of the AFP.
The chief of surgery orthopédique and traumatologique hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves catoné announced that it would go on Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has sharply questioned Dr Stéphane delajoux, the neurochirurgien which has operated the singer on 26 November at the clinic's international Park morass in Paris.
We said it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles have said they were outraged, said Mr Camus.
I have heard about a possible legal action to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus has estimated that Johnny Hallyday party was "far too quickly for Los Angeles, with permission from the surgeon Parisian".
I had this doctor in person in line, which has assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, given that I had two hernies discales, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, it had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without combat with nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr Stéphane delajoux is very experienced in the midst of art.
He had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death in a clinic to Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was operating at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reduce a hématome following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse, repeatedly condemned by the justice, in cases in medical liability, and for tax fraud and deception.
I Metzner tree, the lawyer of the order of doctors, has been accused of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and who is "not appropriate".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David koubbi.
It has indicated that the intervention was "quite well" and that the tests post-opératoires were "normal".
The operation "was not required hémorragique and do not have a combat," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health worries are mounting for this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the Tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and after the new centre to stop using the acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the modem to François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym of the ex-parti giscardien, i.e., not to use it on any carrier, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou not to defend his legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support its approach, it has received the support of Hervé de Charette (ex-ump past the NC) which claims ownership of the UDF for being the first to the table in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the Bureau of the Association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not want to lose, is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member, the request not to use the letters and transfer the ownership of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days the statements indicating that you would suggest to your political movement of + resume + the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the bureau, François Bayrou and de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator John Arthuis centrist alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow on your material militant and on the sheet to your site, the name of this movement, the new centre + + +, the slogan the UDF today +, also see the signatories of the mail.
As you know, you have no right to this symbol, explains the office of the UDF that is the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF to support and (his) website."
It also calls for Hervé de Charette "to pass on the property of (the) marks its legitimate copyright holders".
If you are not the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF warn the signatories.
In their letter they specify that the UDF 'is a political movement in full since 1978, "and argued that Mr Morin and his friends had" chosen "to leave in 2007" to create a competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP. "
The new centre did so, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material interests and moral 'training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, is pursuing the bureau, "when he established the brand," he was "more unites the UDF for three years', but the UMP.
It is outrageous and sentenced to the abscence submission to the UDF to carry out to his account.
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils before to see the irony about the strategy of the NC: "It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for themselves than to try to get out of anonymity in fraudulently a name that was not right '.
Liliane Bettencourt affair: françois-marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to assess the artist françois-marie Banier to determine if, as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of the weakness of the 80-year-old to rob a part of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for its pictures of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a criminal offence to a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment and 375.000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families of France, where mother and daughter have been taking the reins of the empire of the Oréal cosmetic.
But the 15th House criminal has also ordered that a medical expertise to Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be conducted as a college by three doctors.
Heir and main shareholder of the Oréal has always refused to bow to such scrutiny, not in any case under the terms proposed by the public prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors named Friday to submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying, especially if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in the state of weakness and what periods.
I think it will.
I am going to speak, said at the exit of the hearing Mrs Bettencourt lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
The lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years ago, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has engaged in criminal proceedings against françois-marie Banier, photographer and touche-à-tout artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years to the weakness of his mother for a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or pictures of Masters.
In his hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, she sees as a longstanding friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of action taken by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers pleadings, the lawyers have sometimes turned into a large display of family on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt indicated three letters sent by its user (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his solicitor, in which it said was wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: 'Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years ago.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage. "
The prosecutor of Nanterre has estimated that the began was not acceptable to act as a judge tutelles refused these days to grant her request to open a legal protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the ability to act, it is not under the protection and has no guardian.
Nobody else has to act in its place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, marie-chrsitine daubigney.
The court has decided that he consulted once the trial will take place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of the intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence has been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, recalls the position of companies from consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined to as high as it was used to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians from the factory.
By the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution marketing has called the strategies of the conquest of markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products unrelated factors of preferences of customers returning regularly.
A demobilisation employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of something much more general, particularly the frameworks.
This demobilisation threatens the development of all the company ’ s intellectual functions, including R & D, and even more, the intelligence.
Indeed, the diplomacy 'demand that all stakeholders … a pro-active and a forward-looking vision'; it needs by employees a commitment that revenue from management irks authoritarian tendencies.
This is why we call for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company as the customer.
The value relative to the opinion of internal investigations.
The investigation of domestic opinion – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial?
Unfortunately, I suspect not.
Firstly because I saw that, in a new situation, any structure comes after the beating, primarily … what it has always done.!
- then, because the authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of the pouvoir- grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the leaders have a simple view of human behaviour.
From the great schools engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They are, for comfort, intellectual, the old theory behavioriste, cranked up recently by the "Neuroscience" American and widely distributed, unbeknownst to them by institutes of studies and the media.
So, suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of context, a recent survey by Ipsos appeared in the figaro.fr it reinforces the leaders in a position of governance, mechanistic unsuited to the world today.
Identify the causes of militancy.
Instead, the revolution managerial skills necessary to the functioning of the modern, requires companies to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It is to include, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment for the company is possible if it is clear as a means of achieving their dreams, their ambitions of their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle embrace this idea of incentives to employees.
These studies have shown that they believe their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them through their image from the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their projects.
Thanks to the identification and the extent of these factors of mobilisation, business managers can control, and anticipate their 'performance' and put their management of human resources "to the place".
They create a fertile breeding ground for a concerted economic intelligence of a robust and effective.
Oslo speech: "just war" is the praise from the right to Obama
The American right welcomed Friday's speech on the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of America.
The Conservatives, who has ridiculed the Prize to Barack Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speeches, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for vice-president during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, égérie the right-hand side of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today ', adding itself addressed the subject of war' sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is obviously the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists everything out there, she felt.
Mr Obama, who has inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan, nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich has estimated that the president had done in Oslo "very good job".
I found the speech was very well, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, who has particularly appreciated the mention of "The existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
By some side, I found this quite historic, said Mr Gingrich, asked at the radio programme 'The Takeaway. "
The former elected, regarded by some as a candidate at the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, is pleased to have seen "a president left" to remind members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former boxer George W. Bush handed over in the Washington Post columnist, Mr Obama made "a very American."
In addition to present itself as "citizen of the world" as it always does', "he spoke as an American President", pointing out the Europeans' that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and they do little to preserve biodiversity, "said Mr Gerson.
Among the rare right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, has described the speech "dull, spouted and inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
Has the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich has alarmed to see Barack Obama to justify the use of force.
When we are funding the war in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The Press of centre-left remained, however, glowing in the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, described his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide the international decisions against the wars, poverty and oppression," has inflamed the Daily Californian.
Mr Obama "gave the speech he was", has estimated the New York Times, the judges' the dark and inspiring ".
Drivers: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of négociations-marathon, sector unions Road and TLF employers' organisation, only to be stayed until the end, arrived on Friday evening in a deal that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
In the sitting signatures on Friday evening, secretary of state transportation, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" of this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, launched on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of debate the negotiators were left in the morning on Friday, with the hope to sign soon after the morning the text.
Even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, unostra, otre) had been closed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting began at 11.00 so that everyone is agreed, and that at 6 p.m. the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for the companies' and 'it was feared that it will disrupt the Christmas holidays for years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides a salary increases of 4% for the lowest wages (in the road transport to local and regional), and 2.9% for the highest (international).
In the hourly rate for the bas-salaires, "the 8,72 euros to 9,06.
It is not much, but it is very far, said Patrice closed (FO).
This is going to give the order to our activists that there is no, no amount of supplies.
But there may still have some holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the senior salaries because of international competition."
According to him, the increases will be the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees, said Maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry douine (CFTC) has welcomed a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has raised "a compromise acceptable".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3%, and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable us to address the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau said that "a drop of 100 million euros in employers' contributions" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill to reform finance for 2009, voted in last Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same."
The signing of TLF means that the agreement will first apply to companies adhérentes this organisation, and in a second time, to the profession in case of extended by the Minister of Labour.
It will "soon", has assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised for the sector to offset some of the carbon tax."
The secretary of state to transport has forced to negotiate in the emergency, not at the conclusion of a shared, but not to antagonise the chewing next particularly Turkey, has complained about the unostra.
For the otre the agreement is likely to deepen the grave of a large number of small businesses in the sector in the next 12 months ".
A: economic disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals for the RATP
The disruption on the economic, the biggest line of public transport of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday in the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP has left on their hunger for their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend shopping before Christmas, there are trains between 10.00 a.m.and 8 p.m., with a train on two on the central stretch (between defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central stretch.
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture, which will force passengers to change.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy that "the RATP is making efforts to deliver the big stores".
The economic was crossing of the West is the city of Paris.
The stretch RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in boissy-saint-léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
On Friday, about a train on two circulated in the rush hours, and almost no rowed in empty hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there was no melee on the dock, the franciliens is being organised.
This morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially as they and the absence of pupils.
Has boissy-saint-léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack nbakina, an engineer for 29 years ago, explained to be lifted "half an hour earlier, so be sure to arrive on time."
The station Saint-Lazare has not been saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and police.
The economic has operated by the train from or to cergy-le-haut arrived or jaunt to the station Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general meetings of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, regarded as "disappointing" by the trade unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of economic proposes to negotiate a special protocol for the economic has on all aspects of working time, holding career etc.
This is not want drivers, who demand a premium because, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP is even its proposals for a premium, incidentally, was incensed the CGT, stressing that the leadership "was not kaput to solve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the working conditions," said the RATP.
What made the unions that the companies' mocks users of the weekend ".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which refused until then, any discussion during the strike, suggested "in the interests of appeasement," the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the economic B on Tuesday, after a warning by UNSA and independent.
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, independent) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on that line the million daily passengers.
The drivers of economic, all in the second part of careers, have 2.200 to 2.700 euros crude that 600 to 650 euros in premiums, the Times odds, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish courts dissolved the pro-Kurdish party decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court said Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east and Istanbul.
This decision is likely to complicate the task of the government, which has just reach out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its unity indivisible", told the press the president of the court Hasim kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimous in the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven was required to make the dissolution, said Mr kiliç, adding that 37 senior party, its president, Ahmet türk and member Aysel Tugluk are banned from politics for five years ago.
The judge has also announced the closure of parliamentary immunity had enjoyed Mr and Mrs Tugluk türk and confiscated by the Treasury assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would be moving out of parliament rather than to sit as members of parliament without a label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP to obey 'directives "of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase legal policy of PKK rebels.
The party holds, however, that he did "not organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and the government to negotiate with him.
The court's verdict comes as the government has just reach out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of steps up its rights, to try to stymie the support of Kurdish PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a collapse could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south-east anatolien, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
When the news of Justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the big city in the south-east populated by a majority of Kurds.
The police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators caught the Molotov cocktails or stones, with slings.
One hundred people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr türk said that the court ruling was "deepening despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish ndlr) by banning a party, he said at the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, has also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said the minister of energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a torpillage total of the Democratic opening launched by the government, has commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, with a response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers, three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the more deadly in recent months.
The new Silicon-valley ’ "
For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, banned the Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place to search for the secret weapon, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 people to 37 miles of the centre of Moscow, has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley".
Large areas of production and research into micro and nanoélectronique are implanted.
In September 2008 representatives of zelenograd created links with riedberg Mehr, place of science – with academic institutions and companies in the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There was mutual and meetings with representatives of zelenograd last Wednesday and riedberg have ratified a "memorandum of close cooperation."
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri rosljak and the prefect Anatoly smimov of zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwartz head of section project for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, which the high point is scientific research, will go to zelenograd for a seminar.
Trade scientific
It is an exchange of science.
But also economic relations.
It will enable companies of the FIZ to enter the Russian market boom.
Has the opposite the Russian scientists want to secure contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of institutions and companies for research Soviets famous.
There is the Institute of the electrical engineering in Moscow, the big firms sitronics and rosssijskaja-elektronika.
The joint was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned City" for research on arms.
Zelenograd (literal translation of "green city") takes its name of forested hills at the heart which research centres are located.
The project S21 a check for Stuttgart.
We cannot put enough the enormity of Stuttgart, 21.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe."
If you want. S21, that is far more than repositories of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, chaos in a despairing of yards for a decade.
Stuttgart, 21, was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The station front line, with approaches that ends in a city, has a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique on transport 19th century bite of Sabot modern rail traffic brake because you need to once a long time to put the locomotives at the back at the front.
Arrival, stopping short, departure – it is what to do it.
This is why the stations front line must stop: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a station of passing trains, which is half-way around on the main rail trans-European between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, stations, front line is more serious problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends.
It is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
The policies of regional and municipal prevailed.
The company of the railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the price of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public.
The point of view urban this project is relatively well.
You get an urban area who – according to the graphics planners generated by computer – will be very verdoyant.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station entrance and the enlargement of the section are designed for a human trafficking, which were - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
Has the time it did not exist competition cheap flights.
The policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the transport of goods since the railways is much more environmentally friendly by lorry on the road.
But the new route, with its vocations, is not suited to freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the souabe.
It is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is safe, in the next decade the money involved in other nodes and congestion in the network.
The list of the transport ministry says at least 60 large projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987, this line is built in slow motion.
It would really need to support here in the fungus.
But the project S21 made a Sabot braking.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic International, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the national government has raised the possibility to appeal the judgment of the administrative court in Hesse with the ban on air flights at night.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) has announced that the coalition CDU and FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt regulations regarding the ban on night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage north-west of the Frankfurt airport would be fulfilled.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between 23h and 5.00 p.m. in the morning, as envisaged in the national government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution.
The coalition should be decided on 4 January if it wants to make an appeals process against the ruling.
The opposition criticism this time and trying to put pressure on the government's representative for celui-cirenonce the appeal of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the group SPD Torsten schäfer-gümbel invites the CDU and FDP to return to their promise before the elections and who was banned night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a breach of utter a word.
It should be a darned sight difficult to be allowed to keep its word, said the head of the greens Tariq al-Wazir referring to the FDP éléctoral slogan "We keep our promises".
The minister Dieter Posch refute accusations of schäfer-gümbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow the night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises."
It takes time to make a legal review.
The coalition does not make decisions on the basis of a "first impression quickly".
The decision is legally accountable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his section on the night ban is completely érronée.
US banks repay the aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, have taken away from them their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid in full at the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid under the rescue plan relief.
The pattern of American television CNBC said in a report that Citigroup also envisaged to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions are trying to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader and the regulation of higher charges.
The Bank of americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities from investors who told him 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the coffers of the Bank that have been met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday evening last year, Kenneth Lewis, the director general of the Bank of America held to thank us taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had overplayed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering money on the financial markets in order to release the guardianship of the state.
The American bank could start on Thursday a capital increase to $20 billion, reported the pattern CNBC quoting the banks.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the money they received.
Election accelerated
Ultimately, it has nevertheless past faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of chief redacteur Nikolaus Brender by the board of the pattern of German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote last night for the nomination.
Peter Frey who conducted the drafting ZDF Berlin is the odds-on favorite.
The pattern has not wanted to confirm, officially, the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the desire not to further damage to the intendant ZDF Markus schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the board.
Frey, who is the candidate of schächter, needs the votes of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, schächter had proposed to the board to extend to five years ago the contract of Nikolaus Brender but it was rejected.
Only seven members of the council had argued in favour for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against the impeachment by vote of Brender represented a failure of that needed to schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender to his post.
It is Roland Koch, the premier of Hesse, who had organised a league against the editor.
He had rejected the contract on the esteemed redacteur chief will be extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 law experts who had stepped into the debate and felt that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will have achieved nothing.
Peter Frey, who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He has studied the sciences-politiques, education etles romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the südwestfunk (body Radio of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national significance).
In 1983 it is editor in the ZDF first on the news magazine "heute-journal" (paper today).
Then her journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy of the rédacteur-en-chef at the time and corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, and until 1998 he was head and host of "morgenmagazins" (emission of information bimensuelle presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF then leader of the wording in Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender when it had just been elected journalist of the year by specialist Magazin medium, the Greens have announced they laid down a complaint constitutional
The enemy of Koch on board, the prime minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should turn the intergovernmental treaty the ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant may not be blocked by a majority politically biased.
However, Beck has no plans to ask the withdrawal of political figures who are members of committees overseeing the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender ably manœuvré with the board of directors in vehemently criticised the Commission in its Brender's decision.
Thanks to the evidence of journalistic independence, schächter was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face, the board could elect without the soupconne put a partisan politics.
In the representations arithmetic of the party, Frey left-wing Liberal is classified.
Cleansing in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year to strike education ministers of education and cultural affairs of the states decide to be more accommodating: during a meeting between ministers and representatives of the conference of vice-chancellors, an agreement has been developed that working conditions of students bachelor and masters degree should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are, in particular set of accordpour reduce the weight of tests: a single study should help to close the module to study.
The burden of work will be reconsidée to ensure "a realistic and acceptable."
The government policies and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The states have also pledged to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the networks of bachelor and masters.
Regionally, should not be sufficiently different from land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the education minister land and vice-chancellors of universities have repeatedly in the mouth the expression on the way: "étudiabilité."
But for the first time, it seems to take a practical significance.
The Accreditation Council has decided to slash the number of some tests: "Each module should normally be reached by a single examination," we read in a document of a 30 pages on the future conditions of entry to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, president of the Accreditation Council says that significantly reducing the burden of tests should be able to stop the disruption, hurting considerably in the étudiabilité.
"étudiabilité" should also be in future, the benchmark of the organization of studies.
The models like the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot prevent this feeling of stifling that it feels sometimes in the choice of course.
Hamburg / Berlin - the latest knowledge in a raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the leeway to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new regulation will have access to new rounds, academic, but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means, however, that this is only in 2015 all rounds have been examined.
There are 10 accrediting agencies responsible for the entire federal territory which depend on the Accreditation Council created by the States.
In October, the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on land that they are weighing on the agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the regime exams, not too strict.
In some states, universities and colleges specialist, have already heard from their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate so far is the only land to have agreed to give more money to the development of Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise programmes tutorielset strengthen the offices of teaching and the offices of the service of international relations.
The states and universities provide a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wants to make Parliament an amendment to the law on the institutions of higher education.
Following that it will move only one test in order to close his studies.
The Organization of studies will be more flexible, more needs to be able to guarantee the recognition of the records of notes other institutions of higher education and access to the Masters degree should be simplified.
By the end of next year, "étudiabilité" of all academic cycles will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition once again have debated the question of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but criticisms have been heard.
The federal president of the student union Socialist has indicated that it would like the Organisation for educational policy does not happen again in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and the chancellors universities.
In the later after the strike educational, students as people should be able to speak a little.

More than a note at the bottom of page on Herta Müller
It is with the words' arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control... "that begins a work of the poet Werner söllner, in which he thématise in fragments of sentences troubling, the experience of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but lost in its territory.
Werner söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collectors in a publishing house for young people before heading to Frankfurt.
Söllner has received various literary prize, in 1993 he was very popular the professorship of poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002, it is director of the forum of literature, Hesse to the house of artist of mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He has done a lot of him in literary circles not last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the Mirror lens of your files Securitate."
Obviously disturbed and embarrassed, söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William totok Franz, and hodjak Helmuth frauendorfer he had worked as an informant for the police policy Securitate.
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the German language along with some of the participants.
The tests for recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, "concludes söllner so someone who has not been able to resist auxessais intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner söllner is the informant Walter (Im Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel prize for Herta Müller and his battles literary star with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and especially the community of writers Germans from Romania, for a case which clearly shows the abyss and committed the heinous act of a political system, based on police surveillance and intelligence.
Werner söllner is as much as we can say from the current knowledge, not just guilty but also a victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, Im Walter has played a role, the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of Im Walter, who had intervened in his favour.
"It had been drawn from all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel felt the need moralde make this comment.
The form in which söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit, having read the 914 pages of his own case.
We can assume that the victims have been speculation and sometimes have guessed what names real hiding last the names of loans Sorin, voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany where time between the consultation of the Stasi process is a reliable, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A systematic investigation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed down in the past.
This is that in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was created to work the assimilation of archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of cases has dragged on since.
Is there since 2005, a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very much, is confirmed by the interview a former head of the Securitate to temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, by way of trés dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and eventually had been questioned only once.
The shame of power was believed to be able to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, unavoidable questions are involved in the case söllner as it happens so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now?, which has been robbed? the prudent reaction listeners, according to söllner, gives us hope that the next chapter will be defined more by a desire to know that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received yesterday, the Nobel Prize, is more than a note at the bottom of page.
Storms in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was there, best from any right to a celebration of Christmas nice, on which the sportswear manufacturer had displayed its goods when the new coach VfB Christian Gross Monta at midnight the quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just called, a plastic bag, Orange, the supplier.
The man, whose skull chauve drew the attention, allowed himself to lead in the city that he was still.
Otherwise our quinquagénaire could take the wheel itself – he had not been drinking alcohol and it was not intoxicated happiness.
He had spent a night pleasant but tomorrow we had to return to work.
Because it is now that it would start.
The words of Switzerland that came to take three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final," it is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni Romania ’ but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal struggle not to fall. "
"The great work," We expected Sunday.
There, it is repeated in Mainz, the results of the Champions League.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals a hasty to Marica (5), träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing on the fate
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / return match 9. / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be drawn to the 18. December to Nyon.
The joy of taking office fulminante the successor to Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only among those who brought a chance, who had sent to Stuttgart destabilised, a highly motivated and fun to play.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explain the plumber 'souls' – Gross, the recipe for success would sound if bienmais which are more effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - in favour of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause for wound, move among the best player thanks to his dynamism, try to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial ‘ fresh winds "and the modus operandi of the new leader:" It is someone who take action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet over the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For now, VfB Stuttgart are in need of tenacity.
Just as Gross, the players and the manager tightlipped about overstate the victory against a defense completely out of date and weakened the guests Romanians.
They also won in Glasgow before we had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with the 0: 4, Khedira object.
Heldt Horst, the manager, said that they did reach the goals of the season but they do others who are still miles away.
We have not yet past the difficult hurdle.
That Heldt the day of his 40th birthday was not the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview of the Guardian of Jens Lehmann did pick up just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others are not Jens, undermined Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the direction of weakness in style and said that it had decided to change of coach under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann was judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele his day of free after the game he was removed.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure self-interest" slid Heldt and announced the consequences for the Guardian of purpose.
They could become friends for life in these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they were in agreement for the rest, is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong sports representation and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his aides were "for a large part in the Heldt retorted success" and Lehmann in chorus – and even the rights to the plastic bag argument.
World championship heavyweights
Fight hot in Bern, Kevin Johnson the challenger causing constantly verbally and gestuellement the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian advocated in 1764 his title of world champion of the lorry, according to the version of the Federation WBC.

Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world champion of the lorry.
The Federation WBC announced that in the Saturday night the champion of 38 years ago had won a victory points to the unaminité judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).

Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko words and gestures have reached the very rarely the champion.
It is the second boxeur after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having overtaken with Klitschko distance of the 12 rounds.
The Challenger had done a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.

It seems that its development company intends to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Full frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Defence Minister Guttenberg lie in the case of the case Kunduz.
The SPD and the left (left) to ask the Chancellor of the explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - after examining the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The minister has intentionally, "a fiction" on the deadly attack two camions-citernes in September, said the leader of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday over the release of information to the pattern "Tagesschau ard" (The Journal of 20h).
This means that he lied.
The order of killing has been given to disregard the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (Isaf).
It is, in essence, the report available to NATO and has been read by Mr Guttenberg Trittin, has said.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the aim of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the trucks stolen, but sought to eliminate two major Taliban leadership.
According to the inquiry report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured during the attack American airline which was launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, commander of military Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have called on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to vote as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin, and his colleague from the Green Party Renate künast believe that Mrs Merkel must make clear if the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy, the government fédéralet if the chancellery, the army and intelligence services have approved a new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The chancellery has in no Facon influenced the speeches of the Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter wichert was presented by the ministry.
According to the intelligence of the newspaper Spiegel, the information they had surrendered to Guttenberg on the attack tankers were both accurate and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of NATO and hid the minister details troublesome.
In the entourage of two senior officials, it suggests, however, they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein, and a report of the military police.
"The Frankfurter allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that wichert" would have now asked in a letter a clarification of the facts.
Until now, it has received no reply
On Saturday, the ministry did not want to comment on these accusations, and sent to the commission of inquiry of the federal parliament which would be the next Wednesday to dapporter light on the facts.
The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among patients with mental health or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality are mixed.
While these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying down in our bedrooms overshadowed, we can do without hindrance to the dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has the reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices are not that among patients with mental or under the effects of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in question: is the same activity neuronale which allows us to design houses, painting tables or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and the reality to vanish.
A state of Awakening aware, taking the shape of a dream, can come under the most diverse, at best it is called visions, the worst of madness.
But even if the cause and effect distinguish themselves, the visions of the mystique Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age Carlos Castaneda, the latter of chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of substances neurotransmettrices brain - first the dopamine, the noradrenalin, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Hallucinations and délirantes complex thoughts are very often during a psychosis, schizophrenic.
The pull on earth has more power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, found in 1861, "a great similarity between the madness and the dream" for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory who made up."
We are in the autumn of 2001 when Henning t turned into a figure of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the criardes colours.
The attraction on earth has more power over him, there is to flood the ceiling.
It is a blow.
Behind him creatures of Devil ailées, grimaçantes, the bloody, showing its teeth.
They are, give it the feet with heavy boots, the flamboyantes cast against the walls, it feels the pain throughout the body.
The voice over grand, evil, howl, leaving the walls and radio.
It can no longer tolerate those who insult and humiliating.
Henning T. snatched two cables to its chain stéréo, in fact a circle and attaches to a crochet set the ceiling.
It gets on a baffle and goes on the circle around the neck.
It is clear.
The circle stands out.
This is a lesson to you, are the voices in a chorus to extract the tympan. "is in a clinic and fais-toi cure!"
Today Henning T. 40 years ago has lived six psychoses acute, the last 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he married for three years ago.
During the fear I have experienced the fears terrible and despondency deep.
Illusions are a harsh reality.
Around one percent of the population suffers from at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in the psychiatric hospitals is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the world indoors and the outside world, they are in a state of wildly excitement, they may suffer from hallucinations, of megalomania, madness relationnelle or persecution.
It is very easy to hear voices – people who order, which elicited comments or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer to filter the signals troublemakers, the conscious is deluged with sensations.
As the dream, the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality into the hype is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of department of psychiatry of Chu in Heidelberg (Allgemeine psychiatry Im universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, in a focused on him.
Meanwhile, he finds himself in a passive role, it is a dream, overcome by the events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, inspected and manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a harsh reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in his life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the structure sensory and space of the reality that is seen during the hype, is fundamentally retained".
The thoughts and hallucinations délirantes are based on reality and alienation of lived in a real framework.
Why our brains do this kind of ’, is always a puzzle for scientists.
Exceptional situations can get everyone to lose the moment the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
The researchers suspect that those involved to tiny brain damage.
We assume that the neuronale maturation of the brain is distraught at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what is still unexplained, was how the anomaly of the system neuronal happens and also the fact that it is not for many years.
The environmental factors also play a role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, however, if there is predisposition.
Of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they operate on the neurotransmitters.
When our brain heat.
This is crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic suffer from hallucinations and take their medicines costly to get away, while others are buying drugs very expensive to buy.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a point of view.
Kasten together for ten years of reports of hallucinations and phenomena of images of make-believe: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "the imaginary world in our heads".
The hallucinations do well among the concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
There are some psychological problems as borderline or depression but also the headache, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or the trauma crânien.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of people healthy is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consists of fragments of memories which inhibits normally.
They take shape when the brain areas concerning sensory perceptions, is HyperActives or no stop; when our brain heat but also when there is no stimulus.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus, stress, much misery of love or other mental states exceptional.
In recent surveys, one third of participants acknowledges having at least once in his life experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives a small town of Pomerania, and it is going to school.
A young girl to do everything normal to tell the truth.
If there was not the images and voices.
In the playground, it is a young boy, thin, with long hair châtain, send him the floor.
When it meets his comrades watch, surprised – nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this girl timid is a rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
It is led, hear and see this boy just as it sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
It is a sense of fun, it is this young sympathetic.
I am mad?, is it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in class, sometimes it can follow the course because the professor is just trying to present a new pupil in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is obviously going to explain the equations in the picture.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his house, it expects that arrive rarely sleep and too late, it often cannot distinguish whether it is being stirred or dream already, if the images to see, the faces grimaçants or the girl with sanguinolentes glitch on the arms and legs before his eyes open or closed.
Let me calm, asking it to these creatures.
It does not speak or his parents or friends, they would for a mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. now has 20 years ago.
It has had his box last year and she lives with his friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came in contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the likelihood is that it has hallucinations after some time.
I suppose that the brain is not quite busy, ensured that there has to work.
Sarah K., daughter, was afraid of other children when it was small and was often alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called her father, since it was in age, was not his real father.
This is the same brain areas that are active in the visual hallucinations and noise, and the impressions and real noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah k to make the difference between the illusion and reality. "every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten night, the dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are no different from basically of psychoses acute.
Unlike the schizophrenic, the person mentally healthy is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for ailments, according to Michael schmidt-degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and doctor, head of clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
The scare is a serious illness, painful but which also contains something positive, creator – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the amendment to the conscience being stirred by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are semi-rêves very complex, which are seen as real by anyone who lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, have a paralysis.
According to schmidt-degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a total failure and move it replaces the real situation of his life by its own fantasy world that is separated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world has all but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is a form of resources and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organisation which is given to men, not to sink into the bonfire of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories.
The zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
It has 49 years, when his aware hand for a trip to several days after the operation of a heart valves followed by transplantation; meanwhile, her body is still immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that it has created, visit the places foreign trip in time. It is as old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot in his mind on his health care.
He lives in the Middle Ages of noble who manufacture drugs based on blood.
It is kidnapped by a Greek when riding a motorcycle that will take it in his country, it surfing with his hospital bed in the névé the Alps and meeting a Korean Mafia.
It absorbs completely in this world, everything is real, even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, he writes in describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
You could say that they are much more and more intensive than the experience real.
The intensity of this had been slapped the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist schmidt-degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes delusions, hallucinations, psychoses and experiences psychédéliques show our representations of reality outside are fragile, even in Eve.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summed up the psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call the reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.

Burda
27 years, children will take the continuation of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of editions Burda is an interim solution: more long-term, Hubert Burda hope that his two children are taking a group of press, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% with a family business.
Hamburg, has long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will become the lot for 27 years and are committed to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will come later.
It will also see if they are capable of.
You cannot impose his children to 7 500 staff without knowing if they have the ability to review them.
This demolishing children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that it is pulling out of the post président-directeur-général in January and that his successor was paul-bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the board since 1999.
It was primarily responsible for the technology.
Later he held the Treasury is to say he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer it took the head of marketing, foreigner, the impression and finance.
And for the first time this is not a family member who is head of Burda versions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, which would have now 42 years, died a few years.
The nommination of Kallen also serves to make the connection of the 10 or 15 years. "
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have been causing a compulsive desire for capital, which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could rise ever higher.
It was never my strategy.
I have never been rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I am not in the role of précepteur as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of the leagues international as the time, these companies have taken too much importance.
The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a mechanism which allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
He tabled its five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine the act as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, peek offers a monthly subscription price and a very weak, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given his success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, another with a free service data to life, for six times more expensive than peek.
Fonpeek presented yesterday at the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited his grand-frère American, but there is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what is the fact of the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection to FON) to check his e-mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it is a long time that it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and options, but for me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders to the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable across Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside his home country, people hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
Only a small device as the fonpeek (it is always curious that it is called FON when he does not have WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various proposals to increase their network of data.
Kindle is another good example, he understands the download books and other research on the Internet.
Without a subscription and soup.
It is a device connected, and one paycheck during its purchase and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see a day for the fonpeek: an option to purchase with access to life as the Peek is already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that the phrase is more fair to the consumer.
This would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
The yellow is probably the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama in the United States with a penitent and a mantle of this colour, it has chosen the same for support in the second time, without doubt, the more important to his life: the award in Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama is a model very similar in both occasions: in addition, a ressemblante colour yellow green helping to with reflections bright, both times, the holding consists of three parts: the penitent, jacket and the coat, at the same tissues, and is with great broderie or a Collier.
So a first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States will follow the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and chose to get the same place.
But the fabric in which are carved up the two sets of makes them very different.
If the assumption of office, it was a delicate manoeuvring chunky, however, it was printed in Oslo, a velvet.
Accessories also are different: green shoes to Achilles means for the first opportunity, and a similar pattern, but, this time.
The salon she too has changed: hair, are now faced when it was floated last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their fertility professionals
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young people who want to be mothers.
This is what reveals the study "fertility and career women in Spain," carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto the Mujer.
The inquiry, carried out on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their career limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, if the woman is working or not and the type of job occupied.
Those who did not work outside the home, part-time work or have a more stable, to come earlier in the couple, have their first pregnancy sooner and more children.
However, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, have rejected the entry in the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
The women between 35 and 49 years ago with a work sets have their first child, on average 3.7 years after being left in a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "these data show that women who have a stable job was needed more time in their lives to get, which has led to repel the union and the arrival of children.
The type of job exerted influence largely motherhood, but not the beginning of life together, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference remains as among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group having between 35 and 49 years, those with basic and higher than have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years on average.
"Another disctinction is also among women, according to their level of studies.
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable job as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also the same

A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who has about 70 years, walks through our neighbourhood in the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years miss it and our dog, a sang-mélé, save for the APS and will not hanging over six kilos, and without saying word, they hit him with two feet which left the dog with serious injuries.
Our outrage is huge because we do not see that there are fun to attack free of charge a small animal defenceless, moreover, was in leaves.
It is in addition to the outrage by a lady calmly walking around and who, when she insulted these individuals, come to fear for their physical, as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, consider a or ultimately anyone lower than him.
The episode came at 5 p.m. on Tuesday as another in a district usually quiet.
The dog were moaning all day.
Of course we have filed complaints in the office of the neighborhood, even if we doubt that it used to much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we want to just say that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find amusing to charge an animal abuse defenceless gives us love, friendship and keeps US airline.
We do not know where is the good education and the respect of animals and people.
Michelin and fesvial, sets for wearing the headphones
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety (fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists, like said today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the headphones, since it is the only element of protection to prevent the head injuries, or even death, in an accident in two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, "goes beyond the design and manufacture products more safe" and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign of encouragement from the port of the helmet on two wheels, under the slogan "to be but not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest audience.
Finally, Michelin has pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for the two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After nearly two years ago, the market for light commercial vehicles are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain is an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 months of decline, according to figures of the 'Anfac and ganvam manufacturers, distributors.
However, it should be set against the good news since the reference to the comparison, the November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the event last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from cars, Tata, fourgonnettes, fourgons light and light trucks) Windows 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect the more their requests have not been dispelled. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases, thanks to an external funding.
And, more restrictions under the limit on bank loans, other factors such as the increase in unemployment and the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation and unlike cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000e have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that no more than 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in ganvam, recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The Association of dealers provides for a year 2010 similar to that which is, for which she found a drop in sales (for passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
The emergency braking is now obligatory
As has occurred with the system of abs and anti-lock brakes as it will take place with the ESP stability control systems for aid to the emergency brake will be a compulsory part on European cars.
They are already mandatory in cars and light commercial vehicles, while newly registered for the rest of vehicles a period of weakness has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by his mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected in the system through the kick to set by the driver.
But it does not maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars, Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of aid, instead, requires the braking system, reducing the distance of their cars to need to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were fitted with this type of elements, until 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with popularizing the so-called intelligent systems emergency braking: it is calculated that a sinister on four with the injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detect obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing pressure on the putting, if necessary.
If it does not act, and although the collision is inevitable, the facility is the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel's Figueruelas plant (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) for the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the plan to rescue Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe is that each of the plan was approved in advance by the relevant section.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be first submitted to the workers and the governments of countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010.
However, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not therefore surprising that the Swedish government has stepped up pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision soon.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch manufacturer of sports cars skyper, supported by the Russian group converg, is important.
In cases where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab in the Chinese company BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For their final and valuable jewel, the engineers of Porsche has originated on the Boxster and succeeded in the closing of nothing but less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance in only 1 275 kg.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof was replaced by a roof bâché Handbook, which can cut of 21 kilos, using the doors in aluminum, as those of the GT3, other 15 kilos of less than to remove the climatiseur, 13 kilos, to reduce the tank of petrol to 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, go bacquets sport, even 12 kilos, and with tyres light of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have relinquished the audio system cdr-30, earning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes doors by the wrists in tissues, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box KDP embrayage to double the test was done on a model to manual box six speeds, mainly on the roads of the secondary network in California, in the mountains, with sharp particularly tortuous.
His behaviour can be described as blameless.
The loss of weight does not prevent the car to drive on the floor with aplomb.
The opposite: it was longer than we had not tested a model as small and light which guarantees as secure in the sharp, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat up its musclesà small speed during the time, until we were asking for a sprinter, slow to recover and grow again his engine...
It is out of what we wanted. Through its direction, as forthcoming as accurate, the car will do what will our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Its driving force will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster (s) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the option "sport" or through a system that alters the rugissement engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, with the ruling or success.
The suspensions are tough but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The décor of roads that we have travelled with the boyxster Spyder was quite weakened, but the car has managed the nests of chicken.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence on the journey, while some sharp we have found ice on the morning and Graviers later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more divertissantes to lead and that is more than a simple amendment of the Boxster.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"bag Girl."

The baskonia is a victory in Israel.
The Caja Laboral has won a resounding victory in 91-82 during his visit on the ground hard of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences of the team of Dusko Oliver Ivanovic. It is well ahead of his group, after the big show of Mirza teletovic which, with eight baskets to three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The team of Vitoria was able to fill the gaps in Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or micov by a large dose of commitment and work together, even if it had to wait until the end to victory.
The great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points scored, historical largely final victory.
The match started quickly for the blue and red, which took the advantage at the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked for the perimeter, led to the expectation that they had jumped on the ground in Israel with the poignets hot.
English and teletovic was the main authors of the first quart-temps final dose.
The second quart-temps was on the same tone, but the team of taken has chosen the game within Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which has been received by cheers and applause for the return to his old house, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic began to get out as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "least six ’ assessment of splitter was already likely that this night was not going to be the best of Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they are on track to the pause, nothing is play, far from it, and the team to swallow would like to remind that of Vitoria we be easily on their ground, and thanks to "the hand of Mr Elias', they get into the match.
Eidson and pnini contributed significantly to the yellow take the edge on the ring (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players to Oliver Ivanovic, injured but far from dead, need to pick up some clever actions to take the air, and only then would arise the machine of Mirza teletovic who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas put the meter to scoring reassuring (54-67), and that the premises successfully increased with the end of the third quart-temps (57-67).
The team to swallow out to go for broke recently and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they will get tired person their take what they deserved in the remaining 30 first minute.
However, pnini Eidson is the best of their team, are not resigned and try to support it since the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with splitter eliminate for misconduct, the players to Oliver Ivanovic are not rushing, defend well, and although the Israelis have moved closer in the last minute (80-85), the game is played and the victory escape Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injuries to prevent the Unicaja to do battle
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece in the face Olympiacos and has given him the top of Group B of the euroligue, during a match marked by the absence of players of the Unicaja, especially in the game inside (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which have facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship or by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful of Europe and with a big budget.
The game of the first quart-temps dreaming, marked Andalusians. An aggressive defence and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of the ringleader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the game within bourousis, vujcic and Schortsanitis, has helped to overthrow the score 22-20, at the 13th minute, when an action, a beginning of disagreements between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams has led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began operating in showing his superiority in the two camps, while the exit for injury to the central English Joel Freeland and the three mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The players to domestic and ailier Lithuanian Linas kleizas, with their baskets to three points, 44-32 dug the advantage in the 19th minute.
A rebound impossible.
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and came to match the difference in the meeting to be contested in Malaga 66-48, reeling vingt-septième minute, leading the group.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last out of the pivotal Scots Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to his organisation, the baskets to three points to cook, and the support of Lewis, left a bit of hope with 66-57, trente-et-unième minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos was when the players were relentless pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The linchpin vujcic Croatian Nikola, manage to get worked up the score to 81-62, to the trente-septième minutes, and the Unicaja volunteer, accepted the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will have to abandon the légation diplomatic later on 27 January 2010 to officially end his tenure.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ’ affairs of the Embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo "Mel" knows that they must leave the embassy, where he retreated since 21 September, before that date.
"It is aware that it must start on 27 January, after his term, it must seek another destination."
The chain has also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, of course with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections on 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya has ensured that it would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, it has tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya has rejected the condition of exiled political will to impose the government is led by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After days of roses since the spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty will arise again, this is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents take decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets has been to monetize the debt in the direct purchase of assets and indirectly providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions to buy assets to mobilise.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been almost finalised, and without questioning their policy 36-year-old maverick liquidity, are beginning to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award a year from next week.
Accordingly, investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy to keep an economic stimulus measures heterodox and we are seeing an inverse of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock markets and business obligations are rising again, although they remain very different levels paranormaux they have achieved earlier this year.
The states were forced to nationalising the risk of private and public debt is once again affected.
There is another flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been refuges chosen by investors, followed by an increase of differences between the euro zone countries and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then, Standard & Poor's its threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
Another side, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who were trying to provoke a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hindered the destructive effects from the credit limit on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is announce a new day of action graces.
However, the situation in Dubai is a fight between the tribal sheiks to regain his place in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovered the pot in roses.
Prodi made in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It is quite irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary for a breach of its external payments earlier this year and allow a euro country not to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and makes its citizens share the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of risk premiums, after a few excesses in positions that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in the public debt has increased to the obligations of European companies, nousn need not worry.
If the differences in Europe were reduced and that the US continued to rise, it would be even a risk idiosyncrasique Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators estimates are forcing most of the services of studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise upwards their forecast for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, due to the burden with a Japanese model pourl Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has all the air to provide an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for the moment "caution is the mother safety."

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress members, which is discussed in recent days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by one of the president of gas natural-fenosa, Rafael villaseca, Mr Galán has sketched out for the press that he had referred to the subcommittee, huit-clos.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 euros until 2020 and 60, 000 million more between then and 2030, in cases where nuclear power stations in today ’ s operation would remain open.
If that is not the case, the investment is estimated to 60 billion but to 95.
However, Iberdola believes that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increase production capacity, but the distribution networks and the international connections.
From 2020, the question, and it will increase the power.
His gamble focuses on the gas-fired power stations that coal, with the mechanisms of recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, he believes that 18 000 Megawatts more are needed, with other "sources of support."
Galán, who believes that the bill of sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with that calls for his company, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts the national policies to combat climate change.
According to him, "there is a clear in the long term 'in this direction, despite the measures" one-off ", as has described as president of Iberdrola.
Nevertheless, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are on the long term, must begin to be taken, because they are some time before reaching their maturity and that a profitable stable is necessary to address them.

Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for his first motorway in concession in Australia, market where it is already working as a company of energy and manager of water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues, and the German company Hochtief are its rival.
A tunnel of 5 miles long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company public works and distributor of motorways.
The town hall of the city wants to have it in late 2014.
Having chosen the public-private partnership (PPP to its original English) to complete the project, in a case under the tutelage of Erns & Young, local administration already has a list of finalistes which will be responsible for the site and the exploitation of the toll.
In anticipation of the presentation of their offerings in May, the investment plan amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last stage competing three consortiums, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group known as transcity is led by Acciona only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are BMD and ghella.
The first is one of the major manufacturers in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the biggest European specialists to work underground.
Against the team of Acciona, shoe the consortium northern direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian infrastructure Transfield and of the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is lbrjv, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which has to turn the participation of ACS), another local enterprise, baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specialising in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major sites and privatisation, but there is a very difficult, if this is by way of acquiring a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian, and who is still a step not validated the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS, has barely winning a place in this market for its participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Active millionaires
Acciona put on a geographical area of great importance to the sector, which already has a large presence through his work of energy supplier and desalination.
Among other assets, it has the biggest wind park, waubra (192 megawatts) in Victoria, and runs the reunification of companies to build and manage the dessalinisateur of adelaïde, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to strengthen these two areas and benefit synergies to enter the markets of the construction and the management of infrastructure.
The road tunnel toll, promoted by the Bureau of the infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the northern link (link North), is likely to link the highway west of toowong peripheral to the way to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 km tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration says that the auction will take place during the summer 2010 and that the work will start in December next year.
Despite the fact that the toll will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel has started to be designed in 2005.
It will include two times two routes, a system of electronic toll collection and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide $500 million Australian (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane, already offers of work to Hochtief
Australia is widely held Hochtief, who spoke yesterday of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.

The last four teams will receive each 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 received by the other final.

The Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are payments variables, which are devoted 337,8 million.
That money is distributed according to the value proportional to the television market.
The market in Spain is one of the most important, and have four new place.
The champion of the previous year pockets 40% of the money spent, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid by the number of matches played during the edition of this year.
