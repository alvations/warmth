The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only maintainers are concerned Krkonoše ski lifts in the ski without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels.
So in Krkonoše still free rooms are available for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year.
We have many visitors to our sites.
People look at the offers, check prices, but still afraid to book an engagement.
And if we are called, immediately asked about our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud, "said the maintainer Spindl.Info Martin Jandura information portal.
Those who want to spend New Year in Spindleruv Mlyn one according to their expectations, they should not hesitate any longer to book your stay.
Those who prefer to save money and get quality accommodation at second, it can try waiting a few days.
Spindleruv Mlyn hoteliers offer weekly stays mainly for New Year.
I think that will continue to offer, but soon surrendered, and offer shorter stays.
And then the vacant rooms will be sold quickly, felt Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all dates in the winter.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, still not complete.
Half of the positions offered remains at large.
So we have prepared some last-minute holiday stays, "said Petr Ingtours director Schiefert.
The travel agent yet Vrchlabí can also offer New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer vacancies.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining dates are sold regular winter.
This year the interest in winter stay is affected by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there is snow.
Nobody wants to spend the new year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks remain snowfall during the week, dates of Christmas will be exhausted too, "says Schiefert.
Instead, it's a little easier to fill the rooms at the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou, last year was more difficult.
We are about five per cent better.
For the New Year and Christmas, we have the latest vacancies.
The interest increases during the holidays in Poland in January and February are also selling well, "the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the rooms are occupied Eve also at the Omni Hotel near the central parking Janské Lázně.
By contrast, the newest hotel on Christmas Lázně Janské half of the beds is still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, since we are about sixty percent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but when snow falls, the interest stays Krkonoše likely to increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omni Hotel.
However, time seems to hoteliers Krkonoše they want to pass the snow waiting.
On Thursday, temperatures should fall and if there is rainfall in the mountains should snow.
But then again the temperatures rise, reported Jakubský Jiří Hradec Kralove, Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's funny that Barack Obama, President with the smartest man reputation as a diligent student repeats the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he mistook for the silliest.
When he finally revealed his approach Afghan eagerly awaited, it was shown that is a copy of the script used by Bush for Iraq, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text repeatedly uses the phrase "As in Iraq," but not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement: "A new way forward".
It was he himself who three years ago, Bush criticized the idea of sending military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from civil war. And that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on recommendations from field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today no one speaks nothing of Iraq on the news.
Bush's reputation was not improved, but objectively he left his successor an initial situation much more favorable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
Masters field again ask you to increase the military contingent, especially the commander of the Afghan operation McCristal General Stanley. He, even though the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the rifle undecided in the White House to a harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months but could not think of anything better, so at least misled about 10,000 military general.
He managed to get Europe to promise another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
Most troubling of all Obama's strategy seems your goal, begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months to finish this procedure in three years. The whole doctrine of Obama raised more questions than answers offered.
Many doubt that the increase in the same fruit that the process in Iraq.
Although the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: you can not trust anyone and does not serve any agreement.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day as needed.
Political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village. Behind him remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because of the confusing relationship, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establish a state that is "capable of action", a minimum target for the whole operation seems very real.
The horizon of the strategy hits Obama for his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has further deteriorated and is now bursting.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home soon," will do a miracle here.
From a political standpoint, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, and that the Taliban will consider it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to engage in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their constituents, what does it have the security of Germany or Italy in the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor that can affect the situation dramatically, is the developments in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the U.S. have to make a difficult decision: try to fix the problem with military force or not.
Will be necessary to seek answers to precisely when, according to Obama, America's triumphant start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution thus mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only bright spot for Barack Obama is the fact that it is three years for the presidential election and why there is still much time to find another strategy if it is a total failure.
The bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses
Top executives of Goldman Sachs this year will not receive cash bonuses.
The agency announced in reacting to harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, in lieu of money, shares may not be sold in a minimum of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn if they had taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs has thus become the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road to be undertaken, said the former bank JPMorgan investor of the entity Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after paragraph almost 17,000 million (about CZK 300,000 million) for bonuses in the first three quarters this year.
The sum total of the bonuses in the state for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to outweigh, in spite of the move announced today, the 20,000 million.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday it plans a one-time tax, a tax of fifty per cent, for banking bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds (about CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.

To defend its policy did add, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, although its price is high.
Janota Minister considers the resignation. Klaus was invited to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning to Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his tenure in government, because you disagree with the version of state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the House of deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janota permanence in the cabinet, are the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
On the appointment of the President spokesman Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic must govern with a deficit of 163,000 million crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, adopted proposals on Wednesday left for the transfer of funds and raised money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats because secretly they increase the budget deficit.
Among the left side and the government, Klaus and right on the other, there was a serious domestic political conflict. Because of this conflict, they begin to be controversial cabinet future activities bureaucratic Fischer, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by the House of Representatives, de facto settlement package cost saving measures, imposed by the government fall Fischer to curb public debt.
Klaus can but do not have to sign the law on the state budget, said today at a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long been ignoring the "serious problem", ie "the deficit is not sustainable public finances.
According to him today and not have a good solution.
Only a strong government that can support a broader consensus among political parties could improve this situation, says the president.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Nečas said to ČTK that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of CSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
The prime minister reacted Fischer and similar words called "strong statements".
ČSSD chief, Jiří Paroubek, Topolanek reacted saying the budget deficit is awful, prepared for this year by former government Topolánek. Exceed 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said passing the state budget for next year was successful.
Popular also were happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: Invincible, tells much about the country, their struggles and their victories, although some critics say that the lead roles the actors play Americans.
The story is about the sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his biography is played by actor Oscar winner, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to interpret in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret, I have to have access to you.
Actor seventy-two, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave of the fictitious U.S. president, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his efforts to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, released in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, after apartheid knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided.
Think it's able to unite his people through sport, so he decides to join rugby players who belong in the world as outsiders.
The South African team makes it to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the story of Mandela came to theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role so that was as close as possible to reality, "said Freeman.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the political world outside the area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be between racks before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that by squeezing the hand, its energy bill, it is transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Francois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when I finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember calling at the door, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was: "In the film seem much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also spoken of hopes for the Oscars.
The film critic for Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, a movie very well done."
In the movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 percent positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendor of Norway resolved: the Russians were testing a missile
About Norway there was a special lighting effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry finally acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway was evidence of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed once. The missile, type "Bulava", previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army is becoming the bane of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his frequent presence at the missile test had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, it flew off or was there a failure in the air.
Written in Russian newspapers of the Bulava "as" a missile that flies. "
A missile does not fly, but glows.
During this, the 13th round, there was no problem at first.
At the end of flight occurred again in the equipment technical problems.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, submerged floating in the White Sea.
This type of possible missile launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at a time.
Therefore likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object actually was the failed "Bulava".
Like the Norwegians from the outset did not waver from that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defended this time claiming that one can not speak simply of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile held and the damage occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines broke down immediately at the first stage.
Although none of the pitches went completely without error, according to the management of the Ministry of Defense only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism and that is why the generals are saying that "Bulava" a day will fly smoothly and achieve even take up to ten blocks nuclear hypersonic whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed at age 51 an annual contract with CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov recur after 51 years at a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help your team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his career at the age of forty years in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practiced constantly and has pledged to help the team.
We just have to solve some formal business, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the club in Moscow.
It remains unclear whether the return of the famous player must cover a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the morale of other players, Nemchinov said.

Since 2001 a member of the Board of the glory of hockey.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. Cancel all further work
The direction of the car plant in Nošovice agreed with unions to cancel all the extra work.
Precisely by the frequent overtime work, the unions said on Monday the strike emergency.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanek, a spokesman for Hyundai car factory.
The direction, however, wants this year to agree with unions over a turn Saturday.
We can not resign themselves to our production schedule, as it is essential. Why we proposed voluntary extra work for Saturday 19 December, ie it will work in two shifts, "said Vanek.
According Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 employees who work the Saturday shift.
The bonus shall be paid also by the past Saturday, November 28th.
According Vanka, the company decided to change the way you motivate your employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can earn overtime or bonus may take a day off on December 28, ie in one day extend the holiday season, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of shifts on Saturday will receive money for the trip and the food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic comments and complaints from union members and strikers, who stopped production last week, the address yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the extra work for the month of December , Vanek said.
Employees of the automobile factory were forced to work two hours in addition to shifts of eight hours and this situation continued almost daily until last week.
After signing the agreement canceled emergency unions to strike.
Another negotiation between factory management and union must take place on Monday morning.
The union chief said on Wednesday Petr Kucha, that if you commit to meet the requirements and signing the document, are willing to cancel the emergency strike.
The situation in the auto plant last week escalated on Wednesday when about 400 workers went on strike spontaneously by frequent additional work.
Also protested against poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
Management believes that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and can supply cars.
Trade unionists in his declaration of emergency by strike Monday, demanding also that none of the employees, which on Wednesday halted the manufacture, were penalized in any way.
In regard to additional work, the unions demand that the company minimized.
And this year for this work require a fee of 5,000 crowns.
The car plant in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production was started last November.
Until last September produced about 80,000 cars, its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: a substance effective even in the 'hardened' for HIV virus
The team of German and Czech scientists is testing for new compounds able to mitigate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance is enhanced by the fact that is also effective against viruses resistant to drugs.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already available.
The AIDS disease is incurable so far.
However, patients' lives may be extended significantly through a combination of drugs that inhibit HIV replication in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If virus replication is not suppressed completely, it will create so-called resistant virus; against them, drugs do not work anymore.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague VŠCHT and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of viral resistance dominate.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranos have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV.
The metalocarboranos are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently to all drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, 'improved' compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of albumin binding to the virus.
The metalocarboranos have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are linked by the metal, in this case cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
The HIV is an albumin proteasis of HIV, and is essential for the virus life cycle.
Without proteasis HIV, there is no splitting of the HIV virus and does not create corpuscles mature infectious virus.
If we stop the HIV proteasis, also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists said in a news release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, of which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to systematically modified.
A little bit weaker, but more efficient
The proof of this series of substances against HIV proteasis was conducted in test tube, and also against resistant variants obtained from patients with HIV.
Metalocarboranos The effect of common variation in the enzyme is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, but do not lose their effect in the resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single, his other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications made, which are compounds metalocarboranos interesting research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS Fischer attacked, he defends
The ODS leader Mirek Topolánek said the approved budget for next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, he says, think their future existence.
ODS statements were identified by the prime minister's strong statements.
They say time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously does not work.
According Nečas the prime minister has to decide whether the House of Representatives wants to rely on a minority that is attempting to tackle the growing deficit, or if you want to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democración to the problem of the deficit is completely different, Nečas said.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however, with the amended proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies raised the money for the salaries of state officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the proposals of ODS, as covered by increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the desire of the government that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten to resign if the approval of the proposed modifications, the situation would have been different.
According to Česká televise Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
He noted, he is thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer is in accordance with another fight against the budget deficit, according Nečas in government have nothing to do the nominees by the CSSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, will resign if the House will approve other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to disease grants, rents, or amending the law of service.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS is not their fault
Is the issue of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, Topolanek said at the news of U.S. text
He recalled that in several ministries in positions of lieutenants are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas said that if Fischer decides to resign the beginning of the struggle with the height of the deficit of public finances, "is absolutely logical and right, building on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the House of Representatives.
But so may not have the support and tolerance of members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I take care of it, he told reporters at the Chamber of Deputies Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was appointed to the government precisely because members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went to a European Council meeting in Brussels.
ODS relented at the request of Prime Minister
Nečas emphasized that ODS Wednesday in the House of Representatives likely to vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister explicitly requires ODS deputies to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, children are not reacted to the question, if ODS is not concerned by the absence of party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during negotiations on the budget.
I realized that my vote is missing.
Following the resignation of office knew that in the months they were especially Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek himself.
Under the new train schedule fewer trains circulate CD for nearly the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) as of December 13 canceled or restringuirán some fast trains and local least used and, conversely, strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared with today, after the new railway timetable comes into force.
Most rates including price and customer base will not change.
More possibilities for links to the capital gain for example the people of the region of Ostrava, dráhy for this line added unacarretería pendolino.
The direct train, on the contrary, it will move to Bratislava.
In line Prague - Pisek - Ceske Budejovice fewer trains will circulate fast, direct links are restringuirán Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction of transport by dráhy is planned in the region of Hradec Kralove, eight percent in total, in contrast, increased transport in Prague and the surrounding area.
Are also two night trains canceled in the trace Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the line Prague - Pisek - Ceske Budejovice be reduced to only some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new hotline Milovice to Prague Milovice residents have to change in Lysa nad Labem.
This is the 15. Esko system line on the outskirts of cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line to Milovice Lysa nad Labem.
Links to long distances to the capital end up in the Prague station Hlavní nádraží.
Introduce more links ČD SC Pendolino from Prague to Ostrava and trains Šumperk / Jeseník run every two hours.
As of December 13 travelers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account by the regional rail this year: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport to cover calls Dráhy demonstrable losses next year get four billion crowns in total, like this year. Local trains are responsible for the regions next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help nearly three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains have a new contract dráhy ten years, so far the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and maybe that's why prices have not increased by a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will occur only in one-day tickets - CD Net and the Internet the cheap tickets Eliska.
For travelers without customer card ČD Net price increase of 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price depends on the distance eliska until now there was the single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.

The history of RSA refers to the whole world, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days debuts in U.S. theaters a new Hollywood movie, Clint Eastwood's Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený), which captures a portion of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world renowned fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, who chose years ago to the title role Mandela himself.
The second paper, the rugby legend Francois Pienaar champion, was played by Matt Damon.
With the release arise from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18. July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 received, along with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
high hopes, as it comes to the public at the time when the Republic of South Africa in preparation for the culminating championship in football. While the media are shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination against people by the dominant black majority.
According to the Associated Press, the reaction to this new movie in RSA have been positive, despite many reservations against the distribution of lead roles for the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman but says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the paper and prepared me well for the position.
Many times I found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as they say - putting their energy, said in an interview after the festival premiere in Los Angeles.

Morgan Freeman in the movie is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was also protagonist's suit puts the South African national rugby team and enters the field. RSA then won the World Cup.
By entering the turf in the suit, which RSA is seen as something almost sacred, Mandela won fourteen years standing ovations, especially the white audience and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship achieved perhaps help people to unite and form a nation, cited rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Still be seen if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans are skeptical, however, as for example said in an interview recently for an amateur rugby LN Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The tournament starts on 11. June 2010.
In a transformer burns Lounská worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught the morning a transformer of the company CEPSA in a switch box near the village in Lounská Vyškov.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for the firefighters of the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to leave the transformer was destroyed by fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water, foam extinguisher and a special area.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, said Pavla Mandátová, the company spokeswoman, the fault does not endanger the safe operation of distribution system.
The damage is estimated at several million crowns, listing just not possible before the fire is out.
According Mandátová the transformer must be replaced by a new destroyed.
During the ten years of activity similar ceps nothing happened, the damage of this type are sporadic, he said.
According Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, spokeswoman for the company ČEZ Czech Republic in the north, the supply of electric current were not cut, and the burning of the electrical substation unaffectionate operation of homes, offices or companies.
As působí ceps in the territory of the Czech Republic as sole maintainer of the distribution system, the electrical conductivity of 400 kV and 220 kV.

Jančura submit a complaint for libel three hetmánes of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency today Radim Jančura submit a complaint for libel three social democratic hetmánes.
Michal Hašek This is the region Jihomoravský kraj, kraj Pardubický Radko Martinek of the hetman of Olomoucký and Martin TESAŘÍK kraj.
Jančura mentioned it in Radiožurnál Twenty minutes.
The claim has to do with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended up signing the long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmánes are attacking us and talk about the fact that we are "taking the raisins the cake," but the price brought only what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. České know dráhy prices, which were set last week.
So we have no choice but to defend itself.
It is slander to the company Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
Both have mentioned the evidence from all regions. According to him have not taken necessary measures in line with European law.
So is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek finds this claim for continuation of the show medial Mr. Jančura, which serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
Naturally I'm prepared to defend my reputation and my region and hetmánes appeal to others to do likewise.
I suppose, that on this occasion clearly demonstrate that Mr. Jančura manipulates the public on the issue of commuter rail, and uses lies and false arguments mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week it would invest several million crowns in advertising, its purpose being to warn of these measures in the regions.
A Radiožurnál told that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be conducted against forfeit invoice as such.
Jančura campaign began after the parts were agreed with České dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and the order of about 150 billion kroner not called a tender.
According Jančura similar steps are at variance with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims he was threatened by a member of CSSD, because of their criticism ferroviaro transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we leave, we lose the licenses of bus.
He introduced himself as deputy ČSSD, I know, what is sir, I will not say his name, said today Jančura for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
Pneumococcal vaccine in January will end the usual customs.
As a first vaccine should be free for families and also voluntary.
But opinions are now, that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine free culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal and is setting the maximum prices of vaccines that will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts also already have it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free Immunizations for children born in August
As of January will receive free pneumococcal vaccine for children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received one dose of vaccine before.
The people who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine also.
The first dose of vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month-old child.
Last year a quarter of households voluntarily left their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid by a dose 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children need four doses.
Experts generally believe that insurance companies spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without clutch save in treatment is needed to unvaccinated children.
Until now, the state spent an entire child immunization approximately 500 thousand annually.
Vaccination was initiated by the cover package called Janota.
The pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Pneumococcal infections in our country die every year according to research hospitals in 28 children no older than 10 years of age.
Besides the Czech Republic cover pneumococcal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is vaccination compulsory?
But both are opinions that this vaccine could be made mandatory in future.
As of January must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský eg, the head of the civic association Nahla.
His association and pneumococcal vaccines spread long.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated were not fully satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine voluntary.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy to get at least achieve this.
I think this is the way we now have to undertake Kalovský mentioned.
The Health Ministry will not change however the procedure of vaccination against pneumococci.
At this point I do not think at all, his spokesman said Vlastimil Srsen.
The voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks.
If all children receive the vaccine, it may reason about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation when the vaccine costs an amount so high, relatively understand the political decision to have begun the vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents stop vaccinating against pneumococcal their babies.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change and also because the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
But pediatricians are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, shots had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members were afraid however, that insurance companies could "take the money out of health insurance.
Doctors therefore have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that investing in vaccines pediatricians 40 thousand per month, which is a considerable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
Yet they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for banning the construction of minarets and there is a general warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and discussed about the possible integration of Muslims (who actually are being integrated) in a more overtly secular societies of the continent.
Some readers come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French do not like veils" ( "Why the French Do not Like Headcarves") (2006), an elegant and carefully argued study of a issue that divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are seen even today.
The latest book by Mr. Bowen has a broader and more ambitious.
Like any good anthropologist wants to know what they're saying not only politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what really is happening.
He spent months in mosques, schools and colleges now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France that Mr. Bowen called Islamic spaces.
He is a good listener who plays discussions between teachers and students on questions that interest them most.
Should I marry a Muslim in a mosque or a municipality (or both)?
Should teach young Muslims about the evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for Muslims to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
Are these seemingly mundane matters, he says, things of everyday life, that concern with means rather than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them famous, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to diffuse this argument completely.
Conservatives just doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
Thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts in Salafi, Sunni supporters of purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise.
It questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite as fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggested that Muslims are probably more unfair treatment of Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, sees "a set of values."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The bleaker outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
Which defines the ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking back the life that can not survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing waters have focused on recently opened, with diplomats, lawyers and now author, as a result.
In "On thin ice" ( "On Thin Ice"), Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage to face the white bear.
Nelson's meeting as a courageous cadet 14 years, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught as they swam along the bodies of their mothers recently exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus act in the early twentieth century, polar bears and 75 exhibited the same time.
Even today, the zoo enclosures are generally still a millionth of the area of the field of adult wild. The weather is almost never appropriate: a polar bear living in Singapore turned green with algae growing in areas without hair on her coat.

Ellis uses stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters submitted to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, USA and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobiles Eskimo Indian assault rifles use high power to topple their prey.
Ironically, it is in waters north of those two nations where the ice jackets last longer.
In his new book, "After the ice" ( "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling story about the science of the Arctic and a breathtaking view of how you can transform the future from that place.
Not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists and oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of effort.
The Fridtjof Nansen travel pioneers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century gave first indications about the displacement of masses of ice.
After the Cold War submarine to map the moving ice cords circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary world of tiny tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by rivulets of saline water is squeezed while frozen.
But since the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, are all doomed once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to occur sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... these could be us
Of 6,000 Marines to place wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier who had never met.
For him and other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, NC, at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, was a day to honor men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months from where we are embarking, these could be us, "Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington National Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington National Cemetery.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping at different cities along the way, to officiate at events dedicated to soldiers and victims of terrorism.
Worcester also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, that the event has spread to other states.
This year more than 16,000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves in Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon areas, tombs in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the memorial by the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $ 150,000 to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were directed to older tombs of the First World War, the Second World War and the Vietnam War, they do not receive as many visits as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and couples held hands, while bringing fresh pine tombstones.
Each outer ring was a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied on top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the section, but the somber atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and the families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see little black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose graves have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from his eyes before the grave of her son.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free. . My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor distributing phones and laptops in the country, officials said on Saturday State Department.
The contractor has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients including the U.S. Agency for International Development United States and the World Bank.
Consular officers with the Interests Section in Havana United States are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous."
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered felonies.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has called several times for permission to leave the country to accept awards, but permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a rapprochement "slow motion" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to give the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity from the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although new products and coveted in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $ 15 per month.
The Cuban government gave ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year alone, are used primarily for text, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and hotel for foreign visitors, and in an institution of government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, press officer at the Interests Section in Havana United States, said most of the handful of American citizens in jail in Cuba is in jail for crimes including drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide details on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly mistaken.
One activity that in any open society would be legal, as mobile distributed free, is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch, which recently published a scathing report about the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself," a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his ailing brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the suspects are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in a day.
He said any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the U.S., just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travels over the Internet in search of young people radicalized.
The researchers said they were chasing an insurgent mysterious figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after he discovered that one of them made comments endorsing terrorist attacks in the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah addressed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, Saifullah said Saturday he could not persuade the commanders of al Qaeda that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were considered as part of a sting operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were undeterred and even were trying to get the proper approval to access fields of al Qaeda, when the Pakistani police arrested them.
The case of five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who can be trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence has been a top priority to try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
Recruiters from the organization acting as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to jihad and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda discussed with emphasis on American recruits applicants.
But the organization representing a great attraction because of its potential to access U.S. targets, because of its propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the U.S., said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their methods recruitment.
If you are someone trying to infiltrate these groups, what better way to follow the pattern of recruitment which many have already taken? Kohlmann said.
It has become a model based more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding "action" climate
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here to demand that negotiators working on the Bella Center Convention Center of town, bolder action on climate change.
The protesters said that 100,000 people attended the event, but police estimated the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the downtown.
On a day in which little happened in the talks on the UN-sponsored climate, thousands of activists marched through the city holding banners in English that read "There is no planet B" and declaring in Spanish, "says Earth "Enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips Peru, the homeland of his mother, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate changes are already occurring. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the mass demonstration to spread the word and call on world leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to do, no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented the protesters get too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to wear masks or carry pocket knives.
Under Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to one witness, who declined to be named because he was involved in the talks on climate, activists wearing masks and black outfits sporting several explosive devices planted near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were the buildings, he said, adding that started as flames, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key staff and Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on climate.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, said in English, "I really was not aware of the situation."
Then he continued in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is great, I can not hear what was happening outside."
He said that depended on one's perspective to define whether progress was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to climate change issue.
Moreover, "we can also say that affect the negotiations, or freedom of other people.
The test data show persistent racial differences
The federal ratings book last week on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
While the district is still far from the best performing systems in the country, the report card showed that students in fourth and eighth graders took strides to a faster rate over the past two years with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what sticks in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent performance gap between black students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in fourth grade the DC for the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In reality the performance difference between 2007 and 2009 grew from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African American eighth graders remained essentially fixed, down a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is not encouraging.
The gap separating white and black students in fourth grade in 2003, when he released the first ENPE in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased over this period, the gap has reduced to just 58.
Some advocates of education in the District expressed concern last week, since advances held by the Chancellor Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the overall response to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicted, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District .
I'm not jumping for joy over a difference of two or three points, "said DC Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem-By accumulation), who has a daughter in fourth grade of Elementary Eaton.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee said the message of the test scores is that city schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly we always want to see positive signs, and I respect that.
What worries is that we are devoting the time or energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, is training some teachers to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in higher grades of primary and middle school, which dominated the basics of reading early in their school courses and are significantly behind their peers.
The Everyday Mathematics, a mathematics curriculum for kindergarten through sixth grade emphasizing games and real life experiences, which was introduced in the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think that we must continue working to provide the best interventions to students who are below grade level, said Rhee.
Others say the results highlight ENPE whether Rhee can further increase the overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for low performing schools that will be necessary to decrease the difference.
Here is a rough sort of dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional political solution is to allocate its resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest sections of DC
Then the goal can generate policy implications that go against this important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to middle class white and black.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We must strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is lengthening the traditional public school year, currently in the District 180 days to compete with charter schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the force of change, "said Janey, who reached an agreement with its teachers union last year in a year of 185 days, which it considers as an" indicator "to seek a larger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of most future
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, fell and blinked for a moment before the white pillars, the facades of brick and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had just graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Grace herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Yet when she and other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $ 38,690 a year, his attitude was less than impressed guest of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! Here is where I will be! exclaimed Grace, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that he had entered the science building.
Wow, really? Said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teacher-student school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited his three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed its deliberate message: The question is not if you go to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who enter the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these Hispanic "second generation" graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyzed the productive say they often have a natural affinity for the school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play a unique role in helping Grace and millions of children like her to go to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents did not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not fix it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis , who has examined Latino students.
We must think of providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten through high school.
The federal program that funded the tour by the universities of Grace is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, provides more than $ 300 million per year to local school systems, to implement college readiness programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent to haunt the college, according to the Department of Education of the United States.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government failed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure for two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi oil ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies bid on having departed in only two of the 10 sites for auction.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one that submitted a losing bid.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asian and European head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
Be long before something else is on offer in Iraq.
The security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdrew, probably prevented U.S. oil companies risk more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserves in the world, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly China and other energy companies controlled by the government have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies reached agreements with the ministry.
The major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties to the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical assistance in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offer more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major oilfields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, said the Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on a par with its competitors and fulfill its commitments toward Iraq.
The shortlisted companies to submit proposals made offers which are then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each site.
The key planner of al Qaeda has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged U.S. missile attack in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a key planner of al Qaeda operations this week, said Friday the U.S. counterterrorism officials.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men who are thought to have died Tuesday when two missiles hit their car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to American and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA in the Pakistani tribal area illegally.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from Miranshah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly seized what remained of the "bodies totally destroyed."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
He described Somalia as a senior military planner of al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group's operations outside Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Was devoted to plotting worldwide, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistan territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included attacks conspiracy against the United States and Europe.
Had a superior command of the strategic guidance of al Qaeda and was translated into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said the Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremists in the region.
It may not be a familiar name to some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If confirmed his death, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other senior officers.
The pace of attacks by unmanned aircraft operated by the CIA has declined since the summer, averaging about six transactions per month to two, according to a count by The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization of profit.
The decrease is perhaps due to a tactic enhanced by the terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdered suspected informants, said the site.
The top UN envoy in Kabul almost quit
The top United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that was damaged by accusations of widespread corruption in the presidential election of UN-backed Afghanistan.
Eide output occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal starting in 18 months will encourage other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We must accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured U.S. and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian staff, to work with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, spending only two years in Kabul.
He said he would notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I said is it's better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun seeking a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian who recently directed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Frenchman who previously led peacekeeping missions the UN.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested against his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to encourage President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote in the country and cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the indictments, but said the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "certainly hurt the mission, because there was already much skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the U.S. led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff in the United States and other Western countries provided to the Afghan mission, saying it would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the restrictions on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome regulations of the UN procurement undermine their ability to attract talent.
So much so that the UN rules allowed me to recruit a person only since May, said.
That is disastrous and can not continue.
Gates: Iran will face further sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for its failure to hold talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One thing I regret is that if we learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at military and political elite of Iran, but Gates said that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that would require "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually less secure with nuclear arms" because "your people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences "credible" if its nuclear program does not fully respect the instructions of the Security Council and UN its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge for peaceful purposes only.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, said he would return to negotiations on restricting its nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial part of its reserve of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a reactor for medical research.
The administration has pushed for the agreement as a way of building trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have removed from the tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think the tightening of Iran and the international community on certain proposals that actually agreed in early October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that had not been in terms significant additional sanctions against Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, prior to reconsider other options, including continuing with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what he called "unfounded allegations and baseless" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate solution in the long term."
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday morning met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to Iraq's Kurdish region's oil wealth to meet with troops and Kurdish officials in Kirkuk Irbil.
Tensions remain high between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with respect to borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to lessen the potential for conflict, to avoid delay in the projects of the United States to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to allay anxiety on the reduction Kurdish pending. U.S. officials quoted the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government "preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
Not abandon them. "
In a China that is aging, a change of course
Weijia Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by posters that sermons about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children" and "one more baby means one more tomb."
They learned the lesson so well that when the Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birthrate and aging population of the city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, his reaction was swift and firm: No way.
We have made all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resource manager with a child of 8 months.
More than 30 years after it introduced the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children well-rounded, spoiled only children, affectionately dubbed "little emperors", is an emerging demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy took effect, according to the Division
UN Population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and above operate from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Family Planning Commission and Shanghai Municipal Population, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future labor shortage."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual easing
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, the one-child policy of China is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid a critical pressure on natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions as fetal sex, leading to an unnaturally high male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have softened their stance on gradually one-child policy.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 eased many of its hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said the central government officials have been debating recently even more radical changes, like allowing couples to have two children if one spouse is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
All at the morning, posters ordering families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be ideal to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent officials and voluntary family planning to visit couples at home brochures and slide under doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
The family planning officials say the response has been very overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that observed a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
Huina municipality with a population of 115,000, for example, still is receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign still projected that the number of births in the city in 2010 only reach about 165,000, slightly above 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Juying Feng, head of the family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to her first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, have only the medical and life insurance that provides inadequate government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly sees one-child policy as a rights issue, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
Is the money.
Other couples cited psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, human resources manager, said he wants an only child because she too was: "We were the center of our families and we used to take care of us all.
We are not accustomed to caring for others and really do not want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained in a more forceful.
For parents with two runs, middle class, reducing the birth rate, he said, is about having enough success to be selfish.
People aged between 20 and 30 years grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child is time for parents, said.
A mother has to give at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, "have to remodel their apartment," and strategic "must have a curriculum prepared for the best child care when the child is 9 months."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with higher living standards, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN panel outlined a plan to reduce emissions
The conference on the UN-sponsored climate characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, captured renewed attention on Friday with the disclosure of a document that provides ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations to carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political settlement to regulate greenhouse gases, said the remaining obstacles and pointed the way forward.
But it was seen as a breakthrough in negotiations which is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does not mention how much money rich countries would give to the poor to confront global warming in the short and long term.
And it offers a variety of options to key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies would cut its coal production, and what would be the limit of global temperature increase that policymakers are willing to tolerate.
This gives high flexibility to process, said John Coequyt, a senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, outlined a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the top climate official of the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
Sample profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide 3,600 million dollars annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change impacts from droughts to floods and deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The special climate envoy from the United States, Todd Stern, rejected claims that seek mandatory cuts on emissions of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were financed by the World developed.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China with regard to what did Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States will not do a deal without major developing countries move forward and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after that Vice Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei, claimed that most U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense" or was "highly irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the U.S. not financially to help China cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the major world powers involved, the fault lines have erupted both in the developing world and between the industrial and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies to save the planet, with China and the United States to face on their respective duties, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive looking to contain the major emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that is developing a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also serves as regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts indicated that they would push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the talks will produce at best a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, prepared a proposal for 24-page preliminary treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the thrust of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and require action by the emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that should resolve most outstanding issues before the heads of government to reach a deal.
The senior officials, including Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, descended from the aircraft and ran to the halls of the Bella Center, a closed-door meetings and press conferences in order to define the claims that shall be arbitrated in the next week.
The disarray of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play guitar have night shows making fun of the countries which they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand in rather than via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity builds only: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
Lorries are coming.
The first train at 225 kmh from Great Britain redefines that sentiment Monday
At 5.13 Monday morning, a whistle pierce the darkness to signal a train departure marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed intercity train will hit the 225 kmh, it passes like a thunderbolt from Ashford, Kent, Panrcas St Station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
A Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will be joined Dame Kelly Holmes then, aboard the first long distance service outside London Javelin.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The remote areas are neglected become prosperous suburbs, business travel time would be shortened and the change of planes and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle planning and fears about environmental damage, yet can stop high-speed lines in Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government a feasibility study, delivered his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times learned.
This will provide a detailed itinerary for the next stage planned for high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five meters in urban areas and areas where environmental impacts can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan shall be drawn within a radius of 25 meters of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a high-speed network that addresses wider north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the Spring.
The favored option is being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line is split at or near Birmingham, with a branch that heads west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railroad.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which would open by 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over a current time.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 kmh, the British network making it the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to carry trains of 400 mt in length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could run every hour in a London-Birmingham line.
This means you need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, is expected to expand an existing station to accommodate high-speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only station Euston St Pancras International or offer that potential.
Lord Adonis announced if you think the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a decision will be final until after a general election.
Even if the work starts, the network would be built in sections.
At first it would force the trains to leave the fast lines for existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered crucial point necessary to secure a change of planes to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face by an orange grove mortgage of £ 75,000 of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, Conservative spokesman, billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange house he built in his constituency.
Prison spokesman of the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron to complain that the Members lived "rations" increased their mortgage by £ 75,000 to build an oak framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
Allows you to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the expenses of members. Mr. Duncan said last night that requests "could not be clearer or simpler.
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest MPs, has a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have sold almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office that agreed with Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described him as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
He was not asked Mr. Duncan to make any reference about the increased lending during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on their previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee absolved him of violating the rules, following an investigation into their expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds of its ownership of London to the house of his constituency, which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was asking about 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest, up to March last year.
In April, their applications rose to more than £ 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland Mr Duncan did not change over time, suggesting that all of the increase would fund the £ 75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% BRE in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, that guy is now.
The most recent document issued by the authority of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan kept asking £ 1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the opposition of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive "rations" after expenses scandal.
"Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m ** rda."
He said: "I spend my money in my garden and apply a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask more, but I do not. "
The deputy, a millionaire by his former profession as a merchant tanker, was first questioned about their spending in May when it emerged he had requested thousands of pounds for your garden, before the match the salaries that this office "could be considered excessive ".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the symbol for the pound sterling on the lawn of Mr. Duncan as a protest, after revealing that asked 4000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: "It was for key improvements, approved by both the office and later by Legg wages."
He added: "These are not criminals or circumvent and violate the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, approved and everything.
It could not be any more clear or simple. "

He said: "We want the religion is more relevant to people in a post Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church we expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the Church should come to celebrate the people and exciting ways.
"The idea of the Advent Calendar of the palapa began as a conversation with friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality. "
Late payments: disgust among prison guards is expected to take action
The prison guards union called Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before year-end holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until eneropor budgetary reasons.
Prison Labor Force (2nd guards union) requested off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning outside the prisons and "block" to denounce and stealing their possessions.
The CGT prison (3rd union of the profession) are summoned to "meet in general assembly in different prisons to achieve mass mobilization", therefore branded as "shameful and unacceptable" failure to pay in December of "overtime, bonuses night, Sundays and holidays "work in October.
And the first guards union, the Union Autonomous Federal Prison (Ufap / UNSA), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase the discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but say that the balance will be paid in January.
Late in the day, the Foreign Ministry said Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions ensure that payment would be made next month.
No doubt the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of Prison Administration immediately implement a set of measures to this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not recur in the future.
The December payment will then be poor, except for management staff that enjoys the benefit of the famous raw by functions and objectives, and "always blames the budget requirements," deplored the Ufap / Unsa.
It is a scandal, the union said indignantly fiber optic inter-Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott until further notice "all the meetings and convocations.
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and holidays for the month if October is not paid in December, so will the extra hours, also threatens FO-Auvergne Rhône-Alpes.
At the moment we increase the tasks and missions without taking more effective, is more than regrettable daring to attack the staff wages, estimated CGT Bordeaux prison.
According to the unions, not all regions it is the same, as some are luckier than others.
But anyway, the result is not expected, said Ufap secretary general, Jean-François Forget.

One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles, and the remaining two by the Russian relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (men).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, a record he holds in long course (20.94).
In one of two queens of swimming distance in 50 m freestyle, the France of 28 years was with 20''53 during a final where swimmers competed at ten o'clock instead of eight as usual, a first worldwide.
Bousquet went ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, if so, I said that if the world record was within reach, would try to achieve.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers were wearing swimsuits quea polyurethane from 1 January will be banned.
These swimsuits, origin of 238 world records since February 2008, ending his epic in Istanbul, where he first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathing suits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long course this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), to Russia's Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
It gave me depth in this race.
I knew this time would not have enough to beat a world record, but managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann said.

It sold lots of a hundred.
The sale continues, but so far, this batch was the bid by buyers, no doubt, told AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.

Honduras Zelaya aborted exit to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were not given to transfer its territory to the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied passports.
For the moment, following a phone call at night with President Zelaya, it appears that there is no chance making the move, said the Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived Wednesday to El Salvador to take Zelaya, returned to his place of origin, according to a source at the Directorate of Migration.
To give a pass, the coup government Zelaya wanted to force to "give" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to get to Mexico as head of state to be invited.
The coup government "suffered another defeat when she asked me to resign my position (...), wanted to submit my resignation," Zelaya said Thursday Globo radio, which tends to make statements from the beginning of the political crisis takes five months in the Central American country.
Here I stay ten years, I have my guitar, playing a few chords said the deposed president, sought refuge in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two months.
The Embassy of Mexico, we submitted an application to pass, but unfortunately we could not accept it for not containing seeking asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, Honduras' HRN radio.
Do not ask asylum to any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur network, headquartered in Caracas.
If I go to Honduras, I'll do as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the embassy of Brazil, strongly besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government accountable to international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was deposed on June 28, the day on which a referendum was organized to prepare for re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on Sept. 21 and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and be accountable to justice for the crime of high treason, as the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
On the controversial ballot, was elected Porfirio Lobo. This choice was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.

U.S.: Polanski's attorney again asked that the case be dismissed
Counsel for the Franco-Polish film director Roman Polanski called again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, U.S. West), which dismissed the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a sexual abuse case occurred over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of "The Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second District of California serious procedural errors in the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel stated claim that at this very moment the charges be dismissed because the conduct of the judge handling the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, the judge Rittenband (since deceased) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have said that Roman Polanski deserved jail time before sentencing, which constitutes a serious breach of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and unwanted), the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September, "he lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called the conclusion of a trial that would provide the evidence for his argument if the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, meanwhile, reiterated the arguments set out in the first instance, ie it could not seriously evaluated any dismissal of the charges in both Roman Polanski was not presented in court.
The filmmaker, 76 years old, fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was issued for "illegal sex" with a child under 13 years.
Since then, he never set foot in the United States.
Assistant District Attorney of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, Roman Polanski stated that "must be here to attend the hearing.
"In this case, we want to convey the message, not just the (Roman Polanski), but also to other defendants, that there is the possibility of escape, asked Asama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor to the court, but despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to issue his ruling, also noted "that there were alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not alone in asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, again, close the case.
He claims that his client no longer supports the increasing threat of resurgent Polanski case, adding: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, enough is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland for U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

News of Johnny Hallyday "very positive" according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and is going very well, told reporters David Hallyday off the plane that brought him to Paris shortly after the 13 pm local time (21 h GMT).
The son of singer, relaxed, assured that he would move "sooner" to Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday joined on Monday by an infection resulting from herniated disc operation on 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday and had undergone an induced coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection developed after a disc hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer had surgery again on Wednesday night to Thursday because of serious injuries from the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning the French lycee in Los Angeles, who is attending his daughter Jade, to attend a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Chief of Orthopedics and Traumatology Hospital Pitie-Salpetriere, Yves Caton, on Monday announced he would travel to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer was accused of violently Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November in the international private clinic Monceau Park in Paris.
We said it was a slaughter.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were shocked, said Camus.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus Johnny Hallyday said he had "gone too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.
I spoke directly with the doctor and I was surprised when I said that there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated on twice for herniated disc, he said.
Earlier on RTL radio, said it appeared the singer had "gone without a cannula, with nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic atmosphere.
He operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, also spoke to the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, justice convicted several times for malpractice, and also for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, was accused of being "an unscrupulous man" defendant "regularly" to the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his attorney, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was completed without any problem" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal."
The operation "could not provocarhemorragias and, therefore, did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are multiplied since the summer, went into a parenthesis.
No doubt resume the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, NDLR) as scheduled, it seems very risky, said Camus.
The association raises the tone UDF and warns the new center on the use of the acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the modem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Center, Herve Morin, to launch a tender offer (Tender Offer) on the Giscard acronym of the former party telling him to withdraw all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin announced publicly its intention to recover the acronym UDF, as it believes that François Bayrou was in no position to defend his political legacy after he had reached out to the left.
Moreover, the defense minister, whose party is linked to the UMP, was planned on Saturday endorsed the strategy to the National Council of NC.
As support for his administration, was assisted by Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP previous NC) who claims ownership of the mark UDF, he was the first to register at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But Friday night, the office of the UDF partnership controlled by François Bayrou's friends do not want to be deprived of it, broke his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and Deputy purpose of bringing to renounce the symbol and to transfer ownership of the mark, on pain of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose to his political movement to recover the acronym UDF, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez Modem , as Sen. Jean Athuis Centrist Alliance.
They also believe right to continue using the name of the movement, Nouveau focus + +, and + l'UDF slogan d'aujourd'hui + militant in their material and the home page of your site, say the signatories of the letter.
As you know, have no right to use the acronym, says the office of the UDF which requires the NC withdraw "immediately mention the name of the UDF in all media, as well as (their) website.
It also asks Herve de Charette "transferring the ownership of (the) mark for the legitimate heirs.
Otherwise, it will appeal to the courts to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In the letter, specify that the UDF is a true political movement since 1978 "and recall that Morin and his friends" chose "to go in 2007" to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP " .
Therefore, the new center has not, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 joining the modem for three years and creating an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when it registered the trademark" was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years" but with the UMP.
Take advantage of a scandalous and fraudulent failure to register the acronym UDF to do it on their own.
This indiscretion is turning into crime, denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe in politics as in life, is more worthy to make their own behalf to try to emerge from anonymity fraudulently taking a name that no right. "
Liliane Bettencourt Case: François-Marie Banier be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday the Court of Nanterre decided to prosecute the artist Francois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as alleged by the billionaire's daughter Liliane Bettencourt, took advantage of weak state for the octogenarian robbed of a part of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for his photographs of stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 in abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence is a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euro fine .
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are fighting over the reins of L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But the Criminal Court No. 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, were subjected to medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such tests, even more on the terms offered by the prosecution during the investigation of Nanterre.
Friday appointed doctors will have to report before 10 March 2010 at which shall state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered weak states and for which periods.
I will accept.
I'll talk to her lawyer said Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, on leaving the hearing.
For his part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision by the court.
This is excellent news (...) The survey shows that he (Bani) manipulated elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and versatile artist, accusing him of having abused for years from his mother's weakness for one billion euros in donations by checks, contracts life insurance or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers a friend of long standing.
On Friday, while the court reviewed the merits of the case brought by Mrs Bettencourt Meyers, the arguments of the lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
Thus, the lawyer Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters sent to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to your solicitor in which he said was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel, "would explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier one to two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her marriage, I could never speak again with Françoise.
For its part, the Office of Nanterre found, once again, that the applicant was unable to appear, particularly as a judge of guardianships declined in recent days to make room for her request to open a proceeding judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to be brought to justice, not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No person may appear in its place, "said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would decide after the completion of the trial on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt Meyers.
Managerial Revolution "or termination of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence have been in vain ...
More than ten years, the attitude of the management of large enterprises with regard to their employees recalls the position of firms with respect to consumers before marketing revolution: it is that employees adhere to "values" determined from above as before it was to charge consumers for products designed for factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave rise to its strategy of conquest of the markets ... though the temptation to impose authoritarian products unrelated to the factors of customer preference is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees may end in a morale killer.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects the executives.
This demobilization had seriously affected the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially of R & D and even more business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties (...) having proactive behavior and a prospective view", it requires from employees with a commitment that is totally opposed to the recommendations of an address authoritarian.
For this reason, we convened a management revolution that would bring to the collaborators in the heart of the concerns of the company as the client.
The internal polls have relative utility
Are the internal polls, and the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, will encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, fear not.
"In principle, because I could verify that, facing a new situation, and after many turns, all firms end up doing essentially ... Did you ever! B989
"Secondly, because the authoritarian, one of the pathologies of power increases as the importance of their own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
How come the great schools of engineering, psychology interpreted mechanistically.
Adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that "neuroscience" Americans recently reactivated, and Research Institutes and widely disseminated media behind them.
Thus, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) the commitment of the executives, recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directors in a management position mechanistic unsuited to today's world .
Identify and measure the determinants of mobilization
In contrast, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, means taking a final vision of human behavior.
Is to incorporate into any reasoning or practice of corporate governance, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a means of realizing their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the analysis Motifuncional adopt this conception of motivation of employees.
The studies showed that they judge your company based on a predetermined doxa allowing them, through the image they have of the company, evaluate what it offers for their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring the factors of mobilization, business executives can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate derecursos management rights "in place".
Thus, creating a fertile ground for organized development of a strong business intelligence and effective.
Speech Oslo: the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American Right, glad that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has advocated the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had said on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had debunked the award Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the president's speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, Ms. Palin said, leading figure in the Republican party's right wing to USA Today, adding that she had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in his recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but necessary.
We must stop the terrorists, he noted.
Obama, who inherited the wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was dedicated this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had made "good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, was glad the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, I felt very historic speech, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
Former elected official, which some see as a possible Republican candidate for investiture for the presidential elections of 2012, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist. "
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current columnist at the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech.
Also presented as a "world citizen", as it always does, "" spoke like an American president "to remind Europeans that live in a bubble of security that they did not create and does not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very confident right, a hawk in the Bush era, former UN ambassador, John Bolton called the speech "dull, pretentious and uninspired" at the website of National Review Online.
To the left of the chairman, Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he said.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Times, but still believes that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," said enthusiastic Californian newspaper.
Obama "gave the speech that was necessary," he estimated the New York Times, judged a time of somber and uplifting.
Road: three marathon negotiations to ensure supplies Christmas
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics France), the only employers' organization which remained until the end, arrived Friday afternoon to an agreement ending the slogan to strike and the threat that falls on Christmas supplies.
During the signing session Friday night, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "glad" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in hopes of quickly signing the text of agreement at the eleventh hour of the morning.
Even a three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) left slamming the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours which began at 11 h was necessary for everyone to agree and sign the text at 18 h.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for businesses" and "feared to disturb the party this year," said Bussereau.
The text provides an increase of 4% for lower wages (in local road transport and regional), and 2.9% for higher (international transport).
The hourly rate goes up 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started very downside, said Patrice Clos (FOR).
If so, let's give the order to our members that no more cuts or blockages in the supply centers.
But you can always be some unhappy rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant pay raises high considering international competition.
He said the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and respect to employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douin (CFTC) recognized him as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of the road in the first half of 2010, which will primarily address the issue of a bonus and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a low of 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment in the Finance Bill to rectify in 2009, the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate that the vote "under the same terms.
TLF's signature allows the agreement applies, first, on the companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, the entire profession, if the Minister of Labor makes a.
Be done "without delay", said Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "business out of ignorance, and that the 100 million" had already been pledged by the industry to offset some of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties but not to antagonize those who want to eat turkey at Christmas dinner the next, Unostra lamented.
OTRE for the agreement threatens the "stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months."
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts in the RER A line of larger urban public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, because Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between union and management of the RATP, no deal and unions were dissatisfied with regard to your request for a premium.
For this important weekend of holiday shopping, Saturday and Sunday only trains traveling between 10 h and 20 h, the rate of one train every two in the middle section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of four on the other lines.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, they expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed "the RATP strive to provide service to large stores."
The RER A from west to east across the city of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains run at peak times, and almost no trains in peak hours as scheduled.
On Thursday there was no clutter on the sidewalks through the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially the lack of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina engineer 29 years, explained that he had raised "an hour and a half early to schedule."
Saint-Lazare station did not saturate, said the SNCF, which had projected the supervision of police and security forces.
The RER A which operates the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or going to it arrived and departed from the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the meters.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Will analyze the results, "unsatisfactory" as trade unions, held a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER intends to negotiate a specific protocol on all aspects of the RER A: working time, professional development, etc..
That's not what they want drivers who demand a premium is owed, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP offers even in parentheses their proposed premium, the CGT said indignantly, pointing out that management was "not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already settled."
A further meeting is planned Monday for "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of practice," said the RATP.
What also prompted the unions to say that the company "did not care about the users of the weekend.
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the address, which until then refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could spread to the RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and Independents have submitted a notice.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, of which € 30 are variable (CGT, FOR, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and complain about the degrading conditions of work in this line has one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second stage of his career, charged from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros bonus for hours with rotating shifts, weekends and holidays.
Turkish court dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favor of the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish country, a move that immediately sparked angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the Southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of government, just lend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "the focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he told reporters the president of the court, Hasim Kilic, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, but only needed a majority of seven votes for dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party leaders, among which are its chairman Ahmet Turk and Aysel Tugluk Deputy , are separated from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the closure of the immunity which they enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and confiscation of assets of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in parliament (of 550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that the deputies leave Parliament before parliament without party labels.
The move comes following a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to be classified as a terrorist organization and calls for the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the time that the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights to the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders said that a solution could lead to an escalation of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of the PKK leader, Abdullah Öcalan, degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of Southeast populated mainly by Kurds.
Law Enforcement threw tear gas and used water cannons, as protesters hurled Molotov cocktails and stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, also focused hundred people.
After the verdict, Türk said the court decision would "deepen deterrence."
Turkey can not resolve this issue (Kurdish Ed.) dissolving a party, told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
In principle we are opposed to the closure of parties.
So nothing is resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotted the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We expect, of course, a reaction to the PKK, he said.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was regarded as a secret city, closed to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of ten districts of Moscow, the Soviet Union was heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 people located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are major research centers and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Ever since September 2008, representatives have contacted Selenogrado headquarters in Frankfurt Riedberg scientist with the university institutes and companies in the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
It took several visits to each other and now, on Wednesday signed into Selenogrado and Frankfurt Riedberg a "Protocol of close cooperation."
The Deputy Moscow Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrado Mayor, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation, signed by Frankfurt chief Edwin Schwarz planning services.
In 2010 traveling to a seminar in Selenogrado FIZ representatives and managers of small and medium enterprises in the research center of natural sciences.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
A Russian scientific exchange companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major companies and research institutes in Russia.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, major corporations and Rossijskaja Sitronics Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the "City of socialist planning" for weapons research.
Selenogrado (translated literally as "green city") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where they settled research facilities.
Brakes Stuttgart
The size Stuttgart 21 is not placed high enough at all.
For supporters of the project is simply "the new heart of Europe."
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which precipitated the capital of Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, ending in the middle of the city at that time were considered fossils of nineteenth century engineering, which act as brakes on a modern rail traffic, as formerly required a tremendous amount of time to hook back locomotives forward.
Roll, a halt to continue the journey, but this must be done.
And so must disappear terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
A Stuttgart: a way station, which is about halfway to the Trans-European lines operating between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 really be started, although visions of the 80s and no more compatible with reality.
Even more ambitious designers have known that the Hessian and Bavarian capital is almost priceless implement the reduction.
Rail terminals are of course no more problems of entry and exit, since locomotives are reversible tractor unit and truck driver at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE to Ulm and will be initiated.
Federal and municipal politicians have prepared well.
The railroad is also because the risks of large individual projects of infrastructure of the Republic takes the taxpayer and not the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, equipped with lots of greenery, probably from the computer generated graphics designer.
For the rail transport system is damaging the S21.
The way station road and support are designed to carry passengers, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time gave no competition from low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first deal to strengthen the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably greener than the one carried by trucks on highways.
However, the new sections under construction are good for us freight trains because of intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affect many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zouaves.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic about ten to fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money is lacking in other crosses and narrow passages in the network.
In total over sixty projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of over 180 kilometers long rail through the Rhine valley
Since 1987, the track builds slowly.
It would be stepped up urgently here as it should.
However, the S21 is acting as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government reviews the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves open the regional parliament in Wiesbaden, whether to submit an appeal against the ruling on the ban on night flights by the administrative court of Hessen.
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned expert legal research Case VGH, over 400 pages, said the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had written based on this date in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the state should re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 pm and 5 am, as provided by the federal government could not be reconciled with the mandatory legal protection of the population due to air traffic noise.
The coalition must decide by Jan. 4, if you submit an appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized the postponement and pressured government officials to resign their appeal before the Administrative Court in Leipzig nation.
The head of the SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and the FDP to honor promises of overnight air travel ban, which had done before the election. Otherwise this could be taken as lack of speech.
It is quite difficult if one would leave his word, said the head of the green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We kept our word."
Posch Minister rejected the rebuke from Schäfer-Gümbel that the federal government may be attempting through distortions of the right and tricks still get their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition would not act on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a decision legally beyond reproach, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as it represents the opposition, they would have never been the group's claims about the ban on air traffic at night.
U.S. Banks return the aid provided.
The big U.S. banks buffeted by the crisis are stripped of their government bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned at once aid that had lent the bank bailout fund Tarp a total of 45,000 million (approximately 30.000 million).
And Citi group plans to return the state aid, according to a report on CNBC U.S..
With this aim institutes free of the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as limiting the payment of bonuses to directors and paying high rates.
The "Bank of America" had raised approximately 19 billion of cash through convertible bonds.
The remaining amount was taken from the box itself, that it had plenty of means, including the sale of items.
The bank director Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night thanks especially to American taxpayers: the cash injection helped to overcome difficult moments.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to discharge his obligations to the state.
CNBC reported the source of circles known that the U.S. bank could announce on Thursday and to increase its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative from Citi Group declined comment.
In June they had returned their aids Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Pick
In the end everything was faster than previously thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressure the chief editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may have a successor.
Yesterday night the union intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially for not anticipating the procedure.
But surely also influenced the Stop Hurting the ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this proposal not be adopted in the management board.
Frey, Schächter candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The voting was not yet finalized at the end of writing this edition.
Schächter failed two weeks ago on the management board with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
For most of the Union in the administrative council for weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender at his post.
Opposition to the editor had been organized by the prime minister of Hesse, Sr.Roland Koch.
He declined another term of the prestigious editor in chief, arguing that under the leadership of the news of the ZDF Brender would lose ratings.
Until shortly before the election protests because of this, which lashed the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end until they had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, that Koch described the proceeding as unconstitutional.
But to no avail.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance languages.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 he moved to the ZDF in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Following seasons: 1988 to 1990 staff draftsman editor, Washington correspondent 1991/92, until 1998 director and host of Univision's "Morgenmagazins" until 2001 director of ZDF's foreign policy since then the study director of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the dismissal of Brender, who was elected on Wednesday even as a journalist of the Year by Media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the prime minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, said last week that federal states should change the state of the ZDF agreement so that the staffing proposals of the director can not be blocked by a Most politically motivated.
A retreat from partisan political control of the unions of the ZDF was discarded by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended to the board of directors with a smart move: the union sharply criticized the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence Schächter much he could appoint to the post of chief editor without losing face, as the administrative council could vote, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a partisan stooge.
In the calculations of the parties is awarded Frey anyway leftist liberals.
University courses are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the Federated States finally relented. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with college presidents, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in undergraduate and master cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, we agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the race must end with a single exam.
Initiative also aims to examine the workload of students, and wants to ensure "real and justifiable measure.
Politics and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between universities within and outside Germany.
Federated states undertake to make them more flexible overall structural rules for Bachelor's and Master.
Federal regulations state that diverge from this, and should not exist.
Less testing
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of universities continually speak of the improvement can perform and successfully complete a race (study).
Now for the first time there was talk of a concrete content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single test," he says in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of the university.
With the "significant reduction in the burden of exams" is to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studied and explained the director of the accreditation council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Also in future, the "studied" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content should be examined thoroughly in terms of unnecessary restrictions on the choice of students ..
courses.
Students have "the right to get more spaces, that enable and encourage self-initiative.
These rules would be worth for new careers, but also in the examination of existing races.
These are due "reacreditar" again every five years. But this would mean it would take until 2015 to consider all the races.
The perpetrators of this would be a country-wide accreditation 10 agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federal states.
The education and culture ministers called on the federal states in October so influence in agencies, that the amount of materials and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder universities and technical schools and agreed with the ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only said Rhineland-Platinum provide additional facilities for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, the universities must implement mentoring programs and student counseling, and strengthening examinations offices and abroad.
The Land and universities seek to have 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of the university law.
She said one should be sufficient consideration for the completion of a career pattern.
The configuration of the race should be relaxed as well is to ensure recognition of evaluations at other universities and to facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year is to examine all the races on their "study".
On Thursday the government and the opposition debated again on the conditions of study in the Land.
A part of the praise was also critical of the decisions.
At the federal level board of Juso university groups (young socialists) seexigía that setting educational policy and should not be done "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university presidents.
By following the strikes of education, now students as major stakeholders should have a say too.
The chairman of the board of university presidents (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need the experience of students," said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which deliberated HRK on a reform document set.
For the union of Education and Science (GEW) Bonn Agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union is demanding a legal right for each student with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to access a master race later.
Besides the federal states have to ensure that the current generation of students of Bachelor in the future there enough parking for Master study at the best possible study conditions. This was reported a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The Länder have enough quecontratar more teachers.
But of greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education had no comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"In and out of Germany is virtually unchecked," says the first line of a lyric poem in fragments idiomatic Werner Söllner unbalancing in that addresses the experiences of arriving in Germany experienced by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
A Söllner was given several awards for literature in 1993 gave the memorable poetry lessons or lectures on Goethe University Frankfurt, since by 2002 and is director of Forum for Literature in Hesse in Frankfurt Mousonturm.
He must speak enough on Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror distorted their Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate against German-Romanian fellow writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner was awarded the German language.
Recruiting efforts had started slowly in early 1971.
"So I am someone who is not adequately defended against attempts of provocation of fear of the Securitate," he concluded Söllner.
The lyric is IM Walter Werner Söllner.
Almost at the same time granting the Nobel literature prize to Herta Müller and his unparalleled literary controversy with the machinery of dictatorial rule, it shakes the literary scene and especially the community of German authors originally from Romania for a case that demonstrates the depths and the evil of a political system based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, what is known so far, is not only an author but also the victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said scientist Michael Markel literary Söllner after the confession, and stressed the positive influence on him delim Walter.
He had excused or defended at all points difficult for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral necessity of making this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement on this form and front of this crowd was unexpected confession from a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, but not surprised.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, Herta Müller wrote already in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", having read his own file of 914 pages.
Those involved will surely have heard speculated and in some cases, what names were hiding behind pseudonyms Sorin Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files to a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the cases of control by the Securitate is still quite vague.
A clarification was systematically boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the elucidation of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since there is more drag.
Since 2005, there is a law regulating the administration of the files.
An interview after the award of the Nobel literature prize to Herta Müller, proof that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the honored.
"She has a psychosis" in the end only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed possible to show no laps in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, the inevitable questions arise Söllner case, as so often when there are faults silent.
Why just now? Who is harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners face Söllner confession leaves hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not by the allocation of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as to fill the stomach lining
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic orange provider team, boarded a taxi Mercedes C-Class quarter of an hour after midnight, giving the impression that a foreign service member was rising smartly dressed in a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sporting goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The bald man in the property had hired a driver, because the city had not yet met.
Moreover, could also drive the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol involved, nor was drunk with joy the man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow begin work again.
Or start for the first time.
In the words of Federer, who had been hired only three days earlier: "It is true that we reach the knockout stages," namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 win against Unirea Urziceni, Romania, "but not We can be blinded by success: we have to fight brutally against relegation. "
The "much more important task" awaiting them the following Sunday, he said.
So need to be repeated in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the everyday of the league.
And eliminating the weaknesses, which have clearly demonstrated again, after three goals in rapid Marica (5), Träsch (8), Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The second round of the Champions League (first legs on 16/17 and 23/24 February / second legs 9 / 10 and 16/17 March) was raffled on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy remained limited by the explosive entry of the successor of Babbel.
Not only in the supposed savior, which soon had inspired the bewildered profis Stuttgart confidence, willingness to surrender and love for the game.
I went with the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, to be launched urged explained Gross souls repairman its recipe for success that sounds simple, but with the therapist Babbel had no effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted the favor of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, "when the football comes a fresh impetus, sometimes things happen that would not have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, after a pause of several weeks due to injury progressed quickly to become the best local player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen with the proverbial "fresh wind" and how to work the new boss: "He is a man deeply involved, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And this is what I had missed, obviously, when I was Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the manager Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needed above all perseverance.
Like Gross, also the players and the manager refrained from over-the victory against a defense weakened by lack of replacements and totally exceeded the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen 0:4 with the sad awakening had come, he thought Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt said that while it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
Heldt who had no desire to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his home for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which returned to upgrade in the form of a television interview broadcast just before the start of the game, which had granted the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are actions taken by others, not Jens, faced harsh criticism Heldt Lehmann.
He had weakness in the conduct complained to the board, it was decided to change his coach by the pressure of teenage fans.
He also had been removed a day off after the games Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," said Heldt, and consequences for the defender said.
You probably will not be friends forever, both in their forties.
But at least agreed with everyone else that without the previous efforts with the team replaced head coach would not have been possible to show great strength and battle game.
Babbel and aides had "a substantial stake in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison, and also agreed the man with the plastic bag.
Fight of the world heavyweight championship
Burning match in Berne: again and again was the leading challenger Kevin Johnsonn world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still world heavyweight champion.
The champion of 38 years in the WBC version of the association won the night from Friday to Saturday in Bern to U.S. Kevin Johnson by unanimous points decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was her third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian was twice world champion and the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, we could not make the knockout that everyone had hoped.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet at 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice had to give up because of his injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before some 17000 spectators at the Arena in Bern, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, would make the fight mostly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven inches shorter, before the duel that had proclaimed the end of the era Klitschko, was again and again dodging the blows of the champion, so decisively Klitschko was unable to carry his goal his dangerous right hand.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and just tried to go the rounds.
While Klitschko was leading with words and gestures, his shots only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who bore full twelve rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
Klitschko had insulted as "horrible zombie" who "can not do anything."
By doing the weighing, the champion left Friday to take the lead to Johnson sunglasses of the nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, then won the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" belt of the WBC, which previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year, then won his title defenses Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September, Chris Arreola, United States.
In this fight just got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained their quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still collecting all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion at WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to Britain's David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that is planning and promoting the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontage of the opposition: the head of the greens, Jürgen Trittin, called a liar to the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, due to false information on the matter Kunduz.
The SPD and the leftist demand explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - After the latest revelations about the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the defense minister, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), have knowingly deceived.
In broadcast news "Tagesschau" on Saturday, aired on ARD television, the team leader of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys .
In such a case, normally it is said he told lies.
The ruling to kill would have occurred regardless of the rules of International Protection Troops for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report to NATO, and has read Mr. Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday had been reported that this attack was not only to destroy trucks hijacked, but also intentionally kill two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack the United States, commissioned by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the investigation of NATO, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to take action immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg actually knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional killing is part of the policy of the federal government of Afghanistan, and if the Foreign Ministry, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Renate Künast green.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Foreign Ministry had no influence on the specific action of German troops in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday also had transcended doubts about the introduction by the Ministry on the reasons for dismissal of the inspector general Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, Gutenberg had informed both correctly and completely against the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it was said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and had hidden sensitive details to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two senior officials learned that they had even the Defense Ministry said that several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a patrol area.
Meanwhile, Wichert had requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
So far has received no response, he said.
The ministry said Saturday was not about the criticisms that are made, and noted that this would be clarified in the research committee of the Federal Parliament to be formed on Wednesday.
Dream world
In wakefulness, some people see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in darkened rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver unimpeded access to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, who experience similar conditions during wakefulness to sleep, or see and hear things that others do not see nor hear, is seen most often in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as obsessed.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or drug addicts.
The culprit is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes cause blurring of the boundaries between dreams, madness and reality.
The alert states of consciousness can occur dreamlike modified in diverse ways, the best call them visions, and at worst insane.
Although one can distinguish the triggers and effects, you can refer to processes such visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when one has derailed the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain, especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine, and is disturbed interactions between different parts of it.
During a schizophrenic psychosis hallucinations often appear very complex and crazy thoughts.
Gravity has no power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry in 1861 noted a "striking resemblance of the state of madness with dream states," to Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, crazy formations, and mirages of this."
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Your body is two dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity has no power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, winged demon figures, with faces as red as blood, deformed, gnashing his teeth.
They're chasing, kicking him with heavy boots and flaming them and throw them against walls, he felt pain throughout the body.
And malignant strident voices resound from the walls and the radio.
I can not stand the voices that insult and offend.
Henning T. starts two wires of the stereo, tied to form a hangman's knot, and fixed on a hook in the ceiling.
You climb into a horn and put the noose around the neck.
Salta.
The rope is released.
What a lesson to you, shouting voices in a chorus that will burst the eardrums, "go to the clinic and make cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first for almost 20 years.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, he is also manic-depressive disorder, take medications, for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with their disease, three years ago married.
In psychosis have experienced the most terrible anguish and deep despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a harsh reality
Approximately one percent of the population gets sick at least once in the life of schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most often those affected and can not distinguish between outer and inner world, and fall into a state of hyperarousal, which can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disruptions in the relationship, or mania persecutory.
Especially widespread is hearing voices, voices that give commands, comment or dialogue.
Hallucinations are also common optics.
The victim is no longer able to distinguish the important from what is not, the brain can not filter out disturbing signs, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
As the dream, psychosis also open the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief medical officer of General Psychiatry Clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the center of things, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he is overwhelmed by events and can not actively organize.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general you can not adjust them reality, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking impossible.
Having once experienced a hallucination in life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial structure and sensory perceived reality in psychosis in principle remain unchanged."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, distancing from the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still unknown why our brain does somersaults.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose touch with reality temporarily.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies also have shown that the genes are also other determinants.
The researchers speculate that the affected brain damage minimal.
We suspect that the brain's neural maturation is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But it remains unknown how this change occurs in the neuronal system, which also does not show at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role - stress or a traumatic experience can be the trigger of psychosis when there is already a previous provision.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere in the brain transmitter system.
When the brain is heated
The illogic of this is that people suffer with psychotic hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten collects ten years reporting hallucinations and visions and the results analyzed in the book Die Welt in unserem Kopf unreal (the unreal world in our heads), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
They include, along with psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injury.
surprising ways and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, as Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the brain areas that are processed in the sensory perceptions are hyperactive or have little self-conscious, and when our brains are hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
The drugs can cause this condition just as brain damage or psychosis.
But the restriction of stimuli, stress, broken heart or other brain states of emergency.
In Studien jüngere Drittel gab bis zu einem der Befragten an, eine mindestens einmal im Leben Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and went to school in high school.
An ordinary girl.
If not for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students to look surprised no one, apart from her, hear or see the boy.
They believe that the shy girl is a dreamer a little strange, but Sarah K. He knows that he is dreaming.
You wake up and see and hear this guy, just as he sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench beside him.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
It is a pleasant, likes the kid.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When in class sometimes can not follow the lesson because the teacher - in their eyes and ears - is introducing a new partner, while for the rest explains in a visible and audible mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to get sleep, which often arrives late and is weak, unable to distinguish whether awake or dreaming, if the images you see, grimaces or girl with bleeding cuts on his arms and legs, appear before their eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he shouts to the figures.
Your parents and friends were not told anything, they would think she's crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. You hoy20 years.
Selectivity approved last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations are gone.
Since I've come in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, know it's crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or have a restriction of stimuli, it is likely that after a time begin to hallucinate.
I think the brain is responsible for the same unoccupied yse sought entertainment.
Sarah K., only daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13, he learned that the man he called dad since he has use of reason is not her biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and noise, to those affected as Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "occurs in the brain, the situation is being there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real. "
Kasten also classifies nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy individuals do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommended to patients who appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Conflict zone between dream and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, the imaginary experiences are usually pathologizing says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor and chief physician at Heidelberg clinic hospital psychiatry and psychotherapy Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhaus in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful illness but it also brings something positive and creative - the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-called Degenhard oneiros investigated a special form of consciousness, which feels like a dream.
The hallucinations are almost dreamlike dreams very complex and detailed than the person experiencing them as real and subsequently can not distinguish from waking.
The dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, motor paralysis experienced by being fully aware. bei die eine Motorische lähmungen vollem Bewusstsein erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a motor disability total and permanent, it replaces a very dangerous situation for a real own imaginary world that is uncoupled from reality.
One way to limit state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, but the real situation lingers in the imagination.
An intensive to make sense and interpretation itself unbearable situation that our own creative capacity enables us not sink into the nothingness of unconsciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, Zurich, describes his experiences in his book Herzenwechsel dream as an act of rescue of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days following surgery of heart valves including heart transplant, her body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen was immersed in a world created by it and other strange places visited times: he was bedridden, an older man on board a hospital on a train, a robot was watching over his health.
We saw in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by noble narcotics produced from blood.
A Greek abducted him on a motorcycle in their country of origin, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow and firn met a Korean mafia.
What gives all these imaginary events, everything is real, even later on in memories.
For Claussen, these trips interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describes his experience.
By contrast, memories of travel are mind many years later, much clearer, even irrelevant details.
Intensive even clearer that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
Finally, oneiros, psychoses, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the internal reproduction of external reality, even when awake.
Each change in consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience which, moreover, can be quite rewarding.
The snow may come
Burda
The children will be in charge of the editorial with 27 years
Kallen The new editor has come to a workaround: Hubert Burda want to leave your company's future in the hands of her two children, told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda see your company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two sons become heirs 27 years and have the determination to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precaution.
The next thing you question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if you are able to do so.
You can not put 7,500 workers before their children if they are not sufficiently trained for this.
That would kill the children and also with the company.
Burda announced Thursday he will retire in January as president of the board and Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This family member Kallen, 52, is since 1999 member of the leadership of Burda.
In the beginning was responsible for the technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and with it came the responsibility for the assets of the business. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took over direct marketing abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the apex of the publisher.
Burda's sons are 19 and 17. His son Felix, who currently have 42, died several years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to "bridge the gap of 10, 15 years," said Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases and Schaeffle Schickedanz, Burda said that family businesses are not immune to the decline: "This has always affected families are left to spread by the desire to search for capital, which have misjudged and thought that could rise as the greatest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of grandeur," says Burda.
I do not see it as a political tutor of this country, as it was Springer, and do not want to play with the "Time" in the world league, those businesses have become too large.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to check my email, without any possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, particularly for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Kim has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half what is paid, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free data for life in exchange for pay six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn.
It is just as limited to its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance cost of about 12 euros per month, including roaming across Europe.
Leisure travelers with smartphones already know what it's like to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately seeking a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and has long had to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the fine print.
Repeated pulling ears of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have hardly had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
That a gadget like FonPeek (no longer seem odd that bears the name of Fon when no Wifi) get these kinds of fees means that operators begin to think differently and to study various proposals to repay its data network .
Kindle is another good example, includes books downloading traffic and other consultations on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a device connected and paid for it when purchased, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see someday FonPeek, a call option with access to life as we already have in the U.S. Peek
Not because I will buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thanks.
I hope so because I think it's a more unfair to the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this system.
Michelle color fetish
Yellow is undoubtedly preferred the tone of U.S. first lady.
If you attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as U.S. president in a dress and a coat of this color, it has chosen to accompany him in no doubt the second most important moment of his life: the gathering in Oslo Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on the two occasions: besides being a similar color-yellow-green with bright reflections, both times the outfit consisted of three-piece dress, jacket and coat of the same material, and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States remained the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the material in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration was a big fit in Oslo is a patterned velvet.
The additions also varied: a medium heel shoes the green again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And also different is the hair: a collected on this occasion, the previous hair down.
75% of working mothers have had labor problems for her motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, particularly for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This was revealed by a study, 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers has seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in the onset of cohabitation in pairs and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they carry out.
Those that have no activity outside the home, working part time, or have no stable job, start living together as a couple before, anticipate their first child, and have more children.
By contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, coexistence and delay motherhood, have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years with a steady job have their first child on average 3.7 years after initiation of cohabitation, a figure which increases to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time in your life path for get, which has led them to postpone marriage and the arrival of children.
Also, the type of work performed exerts much influence on maternity but less on the timing of mating, "says Margarita Delgado CSIC researcher.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the female age at marriage and having the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the greater the age at which they marry and have their first child.
The difference was also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group between 35 and 49 years, those studies were upper elementary and new mothers to 25.1 and 32.1 respectively on average.
"It provides yet another division among women depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary school, marry and have their first child before getting a job, the average or above levels reverse this sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a son, "details Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth
L'Oreal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress image becomes different branded products, chanting the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The star of 'Merry Christmas', one of the finest actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities signings of L'Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Penelope Cruz Spanish.

Paragraph male cosmetics brand ambassadors also has luxury: Patrick Dempsey ( 'Anatomy of Gray ") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline partner on' Lost ').
British Fashion Awards

The trip has its excitements and Vincent spares no scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to reading and rereading.

Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother about 70 years old walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent with her and our dog, a copy of mixed race, rescued from the pound and no more than six kilos and, without a word, handed two kicks that left a dog badly injured.
Our indignation is capitalized because we find the fun in an assault charge to a small, defenseless animal, which by the way, it was tied.
To this we must add that caused choking a woman who was walking calmly, and when rebuked these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, as a brute who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same with a woman, a child, elderly, or, indeed, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident took place at five o'clock in the afternoon on a Tuesday either by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a police station we doubt that it serves a lot and not to generate sensitivities, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider free fun abusing a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where they have been good manners and respect for animals and people.
Michelin Fesvial together by the use of helmets
Tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet use, especially among younger riders, today reported the two entities.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet as it is the only element of protection capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day," adding that it also contributes to this goal by other measures of educational and informative nature.
This new campaign promoting helmet use in motorcycle, under the motto "To Be or Not To Be ', will initially be distributed in posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycles, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern "for the company, as being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop ever safer products.
Upload the sale of light commercial
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9425 units were registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers and manufacturers Anfaco GANVAM the vendor.
The good thing, not osbtante should quarantine it as the reference with which you compare to November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% over the previous year.
The consequence is that despite the upturn of the last month enrollment accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units were sold by all classes of vehicles that make up the mixed bag of light commercials: derived vans, pick ups, vans, light vans and trucks / chassis light.
Also, the clouds have persisted that affect demand, since although they are purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium enterprises, which pay almost 100% of cases through external funding.
So the restrictions posed by the closed tap bank loans, we must add other factors such as increased levels of unemployment and persistent economic downturn.
Against this background, and unlike cars, have provided little aid to the purchase of the 2000E.

Support for emergency braking is already mandatory
As happened with anti-lock brakes with ABS and pass ESP stability control, support systems to emergency brakes have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while the rest is set a grace period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians though, how they work, can also help prevent many rear-end collisions.
The brake assist emergency it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detects the driver stepped on giving.
But this is not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of car components for Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not come to brake before the collision and half of them took the full force.
Up to 1100 accident
The intervention of the aid, however, requires full braking system, reducing the distance that uses the car to stop.
According to a study of the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements could be avoided per year to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved.
The reduction will be even bigger-is calculated to avoid one in four accidents with damage to persons "when the popularity of so-called smart system of emergency braking.
In this case the vehicle is equipped with a system (via a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, besides acting on the brakes lightly.
If the driver reacts, helps increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If that does not react, and while a collision is unavoidable, the device exerts all efforts for the brakes to minimize damage.

Finally, give the audio system CDR-30 brought six kilograms and changing the door handles for each material, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the PDK dual-clutch shift, the test was conducted on a unit with six-speed manual gearbox, mainly back roads of California, stretches of really twisty mountain paths
His behavior can only be described as flawless.
Weight loss does not mean the car did not step on the asphalt with poise.
Rather, the opposite: that long tentábamos not a model as small and light that, in turn, transmit such confidence in cornering, even at high speeds.
It's a little athlete, able to warm up your muscles in a low gear for the time needed until ordered to sprint, you slow down, to recover and then squeeze your engine ...

The suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt road that crossed the Boxster Spyder was fairly punished, but the car bumps well digested.
Electronic aids just showed up all the way, and why in some of the curves are ice and gravel at dawn, late morning.
In short, a lightweight car, the most fun to drive that one can in the market which is more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.

The deposed president must leave the embassy later than 27 January 2010, when officially conclude its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, charge d'affaires of the Embassy of Brazil in the Honduran capital, told Globo TV that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date in the embassy, where he is a refugee from September 21.

Thank you very much
After days of wine and roses since last spring in which the asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, again reappearing uncertainty in the markets, which is not surprising since it's their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medication used by central banks to stabilize the markets was directly monetize debt to purchase assets and indirectly by giving free drinks liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost finished and, without questioning its unorthodox policy of liquidity, they begin to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB made its year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such unorthodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and corporate bond spreads have returned to pick up, although still far from reaching levels paranormal earlier this year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt again be affected.
Again there's a flight to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors, causing a widening of the euro-zone countries compared to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but it was Standard & Poor's and threatened a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
Furthermore, some uncertainty does not hurt to silence defenders of moral hazard by trying to re create awareness about the economic policy makers worldwide have slowed the destructive effects of the credit squeeze on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the Dubai paints a tribal fight between the emirs to restore the power in the Emirates and Greece have already seen before.
A government that hides deficit, elections and a new government to pull the blanket.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Barroso.
It makes sense that the Ecofin save Hungary from a breach of its external payments earlier this year and is going to allow a member country of the euro fails to fulfill its commitments.
What it does have logic is that Ecofin forced the Greek government to be transparent and involve its citizens from the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If, as we hope, we have a standardized episode of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt spreads widen as European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European spreads decrease and continue to expand ours, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of research services to advance their recovery scenarios and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the fray with a scenario for the Japanese economy is not Spanish promises little hope of life to his warning.
Again, has all the earmarks to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, but for now "Prudence, my driver."

Iberdrola Chairman Ignacio Sanchez Galan, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the House of Representatives in the debate these days that Spain's energy strategy over the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few touches of what was raised in the subcommittee in closed session.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million between then and 2030, while they remain open nuclear plants in operation today.
Otherwise, the investment required will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
That yes, Iberdrola believes that the next decade, investments should not be spent on increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections
Since 2020, the question changes and you have to increase power.
His bid is centered in both plants and coal gas with mechanisms of carbon dioxide capture and especially renewable energy.
In this case, considers that it takes 18,000 MW new course, with other "energy support.
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act recently adopted by the Government is in line with what your company has been calling for, would not draw blood with the royal decree to promote the consumption of domestic coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the measures "point" as the president called Iberdrola.
Anyway, Galán believes that investment decisions are long term though, you should start taking it and take time to mature and needs a stable framework for addressing remuneration.

Acciona dispute its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona struggle for its first highway concession in Australia, market where it already works as a business manager of energy and water.
The work involved is of a tunnel worth 1,700 million dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and Hochtief are Germanic rivals.
A tunnel of 5 km as the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country like construction and motorway company.
The city council wants it to point to the end of 2014
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP acronym in English) to take the project forward in a business plan under the tutelage of Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a shortlist of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending submit their bids by next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million) and the last phase three consortia competing with remarkable presence of European construction.
The group known as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish at stake, with his teammates and Ghella BMD.

The third and final consortium that has passed the sieve is called LBRJV, where Australia's share capital Leighton (subsidiary of German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the local also Baulderstone (owned by the Germanic group Bilfinger Berger) and gala firm specializing in civil works Razel.
The Australian market promises great works infrastructure and privatization, but it carries a clear difficulty of entry if it is not by way of the acquisition of a local construction firm.
One strategy followed those Hochtief and Bilfinger, plus Asian references, and remains unresolved for the Spanish giants in the industry.
Just ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the said Leighton.
Asset Millionaires
Acciona bid for a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, which already has strong presence through its activity as an energy supplier and the business of desalination.

It is the further action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this step would be opened to traffic payment in the last months of 2014, it is not anticipated that the work is finished until 2016.

Fine of 63 million to France Télécom for blocking competitors
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom for anticompetitive behavior in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
In the Parliament, the operator merely competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, service plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and state-owned company still builds more than 560 million in fines since 1994, to obstruct their competitors.

Playing the Champions 476.4 million reported at Madrid and Barca at the source
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since he was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have joined since 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth club to have won more money in the competition.
The head of the list is Manchester United.
The head of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the Champions League not only gives UEFA glory. It is also a major source of income for big clubs.
So much so that the competition has spread 5362.5 million at the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who participated in the event since its inception the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA.
The Real Madrid and FC Barcelona fare well in this deal.
The white club was third in the continent that has pocketed more money for participating, and the one next to AC Milan, who won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the defending champion and recent winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list of leading Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams also participate more money billed for the Champions League last season.
And that, despite losing both against Barca.
Moreover, Spain is only the third country that has made more money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more than any other titles (five, four from Italy, three from England and two from Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure for allocation of money applied by the UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini 1,090 million expected to enter the Champions League.
From this money the UEFA 413.1 million allocated to the fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of qualifying (including Atletico Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million for being there, plus additional 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There are also bonus win (800,000 euros) and tie (400,000 for each team). The octavofinalistas receive three million each, the eight quarter-finalists $ 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will earn 9 million, compared to 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, by way of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barca on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Supercup in August.
But they are also variable payments, are intended to 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The major is Spanish, and has four places allocated.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% second, 20% for the third and 10% for the quarter.
The other part is paid by the number of matches played in this year.
