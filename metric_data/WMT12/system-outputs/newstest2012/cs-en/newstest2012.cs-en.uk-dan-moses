Parliament to support an amendment to the liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal in the framework of the Criminal Code section, on the basis of which was sentenced opposition leader, Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Legislation that would open the way for the release of imprisoned expremiérky, members rejected in the second reading of the draft to mitigate punishments for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for the closure of the allegedly unfair treaty with Russia to buy natural gas.
The ruling is final, the appeals court has sentenced to discuss in December.
Tymoshenko judgment calls for political retribution for the regime, the suspicion of the court 's bias has prompted the process, as well as in the West.
The proposal, from the Criminal Code has fallen section 365, on the basis of which was expremiérka sentenced, supported in the vote 147 members.
To its approval was required 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The story of Libya 's liberation, or the libyan rebélie, already has the losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is dead at an unknown location in the desert, and without him, after the war.
There is to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, in an election victory by islamists, but this is about whether moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has signed up to the common law sharia law and to have some idea we have.
Libya is a country without a crime, as for the theft is seká hand.
Women can forget the emancipation of, any apostates from faith are awaiting execution, and so on.
Rather than those of the dictator will be company consisting of rival tribes align the Koran.
In Libya will order, that we can 't imagine and which we certainly do not want.
But our way of life is not the only, or even the best objectively and probably would not suit the need for change is the Libyans.
In fact, it is a wonder that islamic militants have taken to put up with help from the infidels dogs.
Pardons is only that, from their point of view under the NATO air strikes a General from America, but Aláh, whose size in any intervention povedeném celebrated.
So, when we are looking for in Libya 's winners, the West is not one of them.
We have been to a shootout, served of Islam and our politicians are in the shape of a dictator to get rid of a political ally, without granting any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya militarily neokupujeme.
By the fall of local lapses problem with the expulsion of “ crusaders ”.
But they will be without the occupation of the oil companies for hubičku libyan black gold?
Perhaps the will and the West will finally be able to boast disinterested protection of human rights.
If us so this nepřekazí those devotees of sharia law.
Is entering a new era of the crisis.

The child 's diet obézního: nesnídá and dining hams
More than one - third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 years has problems with overweight, and excess weight is 9 per cent of schoolchildren and obese is 5 per cent of children.
Obese children, mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as demonstrated by the survey.
Once again, how important it is for the healthy development of the man 's environment in which grows, and role models, which is surrounded by.
On the desks of obese children, for example, the emergence of hams up to half of the more often than in the families of children with normal weight.
Potato hranolky should have for dinner on the day before the research with outreach events with the title of obesity is not a coincidence more than 19 percent of the obese.
In families tlouštíků also is unusual sportovat, which is not, however, affected most families today 's schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of children said that their parents are at least once a week to find time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of the last school year, and took part of nearly 900 children from the school of the Czech Republic.
It was for the second edition of the actions of obesity is not a coincidence, which supports universal health insurance company and Unilever.
So far, the project involved more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4 - 8. classes.
Diet and lack of movement in the family is one of the defining factor, which causes dramatically increasing the number of children are overweight or obese.
“ Only half of the respondents, for example, has said that her five times a day in the regime 's breakfast - svačina - lunch - svačina - dinner, which is one of the fundamental assumptions of a healthy diet, ” reads one of the results of a survey.
Without breakfast and evening uzenina
Experts warn that for the healthy development of are substantial and relative details, including the need to regular time family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, while at the same time eating breakfast only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren.
In most families eating breakfast every man.
And the worst was the finding that in ten in the household nesnídá at all.
Breakfast is the foundation of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that obese children in families are much more likely to consume unhealthy hranolky.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight - drink every day fresh limonády (70 per cent).
Regularly while sports more than 40 per cent of children, but for their parents, the result was less than half - 15 per cent.
Assemblies to your diet
Another part of the survey to select children (204 boys and girls from 172 13 schools) to draw up from offered the possibility of their diets, according to their own tastes and their opinion.
“ Dietary preferences of czech children aged 12 to 15 years from the point of view of healthy nutrition far from ideal. ”
Between their favoured jídly is a lot of moučných, masitých and sladkých dishes.
“ It is particularly alarming great popularity sladkých limonád, ” it says in its final report on the survey.
To their lunches as a main dish has won some pasta just short of poultry.
Children but did not want to do virtually nothing legumes and low is the popularity of fish and vegetable last meals.
Attachment to health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits, if they get the right information.
“ With a control group of participants in the survey, who fill in a questionnaire after the end of the educational lectures obesity is not a coincidence, it is in many cases a significant shift preferences towards the principles of a healthy diet, ” says in the results of the project.
It was a striking example in sladkých limonád, where it became more children 's preferred ordinary water.
Children also much more frequently in the questionnaire zaškrtly chicken and fish as the main meal of the day, and would reduce sweet food and pancakes.
Stylista must also be good psychologist, says profíci
In the opening paragraph of how he teaches stylisté, so I am a little postěžovala, that it is in its opening hours was a lot.
This I netušila, what will follow.
Three profíků lectures from the field, dress troubled characters and a workshop on how it goes on the place.
And it will be worse off.
The closer to the final test, the more information, as well as practical tasks ahead of us.
And even though the rate held every Saturday and Sunday, is really “ našlapaný. ”
This time, with the head of the Alenkou on (the rate is not the only boy), replaced as a woman who does not have a perfectly souměrnou figure.
And such is the overwhelming majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone checking chlapeckou figure without proper curves and, in turn, someone overweight.
Stylista must know how optically refined broad shoulders, neck or extend to add the curves.
U. S. go we so Tips, both for women like Jennifer Lopezové, so more prsa also boky and narrow passport, figure much stress and, at the same time, the woman neobléknout vyzývavě too.
If, for example, is the difference between the passport and boky that skirts or trousers actually sitting down it will then pay to tailor - make at least one such piece on peace.
Certainly you will regret it, because the perfectly - fitting clothes to nezaplacení.
In a skirt in peace you feel much better than the one that you constantly shifting, vyhrnuje, odstává in passport, and the like.
Chlapecká character, can afford to wear clothes with řasením, applications, výšivkami or nabíráním.
Such information and types of characters is, of course, a lot, so I am delighted that I have a whole week for it to have all of the information in the heads of utřídila.
And the same fear is that, given the zadanému domestic task is this up.
Each of the kurzistek, received přiřazenou celebritu, which has come up with two outfity: day and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, fashionable style of the figures, and the type of characters.
I will be “ dress ” Mirandu Kerrovou, perhaps it you know from the campaigns of Victoria 's Secret.
In the spirit of jásám, for me personally, I certainly better than that Britney Spearsová, because Christina Aguilera, which recently přibrala perhaps a kilo (please, take into account nadsázku), or mladinká Selena Gomezová.
Oblečky must avoid in magazines or seek online and print out and then graphically process.
Moodboard, as the result of says, then express our personal style and relationship to grafickému creation.
Think about graphic website stylingu is important.
Stylista, neobléká not only physically, but it also creates a, for example, the so - called product pages in the journals (on specific subjects such as trends handbags, kabáty, etc.).
Tell us about it and stylista návrhář Mario Kameník.
But it only on Sunday.
Stylista must have a general overview
Saturday 's lecture nabitou information about the kinds of characters zpestřili three guests from the field.
John stylista Pokorný, fashionable návrhář Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and it should be able to use stylista.
And a deft move stylista can work with one a piece of clothing in a variety of ways.
Variability in this case is the key.
So to such trenčkot (or if you originally trenchcoat) can wear a classically despite džíny and triko as cover, but it can be replaced, and on the bare body, road and lodičky nafotit as a dress.
Or just roll up their sleeves or límce and now the whole look is different.
“ Play a cope with it, ” emphasized.
But the most I appreciated the following advice: “ you need to work perfectly to know the rules. ”
“ Then it is you can begin to break, ” said Jakub.
Finally, it is so clear to me why drtíme all those propositions, what with the combine, what, why, when even in fashion magazines sometimes we see something else.
On the parades, not to mention.
Thanks to fotografovi Benovi, in turn, I know that stylista must be prepared to much more options clothes, than it is to take pictures.
So in fashion story, which will have 10 parties (that is, ten outfitů), I have to be ready to “ nastajlovat ” at least 15.
And also that the fotce clothing looks and operates in combination with other pieces of the sometimes very differently than in reality.
With this, so we have to create a outfitu count.
That image and style is sometimes up to half of the success, we confirmed John Pokorný.
You only have to look at, which is just a miraculous zpěvačkou, but the image and marketing, have made it the world 's Star.
In the Czech Republic is not yet access to use the services of stylistů rather cold.
Even the familiar faces of him sometimes seen as superfluous (just, you know, something that, as in this vypadám, is a second - tier).
And if they are from us people leave a styling, then we count on us with likely imposed completely different (smaller) size, than it really is.
Then we can googlovat, find out whether the tabloid, that the celebrita ztoustla / zhubla and so on.
John and Mario on Sunday asked us to the heart, that is not enough stylistovi focusing in vogue and able to poskládat outfit.
In the course of their work primarily communicates with the people, by putting on, and so it is important to be a good psychologem.
To be able to predict people nepodbízet, the state for its opinion.
“ When you want a manager, to her protřídili šatník and put it on a nice pieces, so it cannot vyházet the diaries and say, for God 's sake, it' s a nightmare. ”
“ Find a there at least a few things that pochválíte and will recommend what they wear, ” says Mario.
It has also, in particular, has shown that everything has to include the so - called “ placovka ”, or taška on plac.
It is the one zapnete around passport and you are at all the paraphernalia.
In addition to clear things, such as the gap, váleček on chlupy or zavírací pin factor, there are also silonová thread (with the stylista helped in focení products, such as handbags or hats), special klipsy, which sepneme behind the clothes, as is more (špendlík or other svorka are not permissible, destroyed would dress), or šitíčko.
To just listen more closely to, but we also have a practical test, how we have, as you rightly podlepit shoes.
Even with focení from studio, where it is equivalent to the surface, would be podrážka could hurt, let alone outside.
And so we lepily and lepily.
Nůžkami with shoes nor should we mention that just happens to be damaging.
It is therefore need to really zručnost.
Mario please me, when my creation of an unqualified praise.
The aforementioned zručnost, in fact, is not really my kámoška.
This is the only malinký a fraction of what we are about the continuation of a second - rate to listen.
Beginning to me to be more and more clear that address stylingu at professional level is not really a walk in the park, they say.
In Need for Speed: the run with závodí across America.
A review
Initially easy ride is because of a series of completely unnecessary on sloppy errors is turning into a routine morning 's path to šichtu.
The ambition is largely managed to meet, but it is no use when no one is clearly did not want to do anything more.
The new deal with: the run has attracted before issuing a high expectations.
He promised that the age - old race series of Need for Speed once again takes a bit of a new direction and from hratelných of seemed like a game, which would compete in žánru action might not be just a number.
Also, we were wondering what comes out of flowing passages in which the hero of graduating from cars and will take place after its.
But as for a series of NFS is customary, many of them in the outcome of a little differently than we expected.
It is potentially a decent arkádové race, but a whole runs down a few unnecessary mistakes, which is in a series of appearing more or less for several years.
So it is that they are not even the mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible speech laziness of the developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You can see in the story, in which the hero Jack has some problems and personal nature as a solution to a participating in illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel usednete on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your job is to arrive as the first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
Route is divided into 10 stages, and then, to more than 50 plants.
This means that each race will go on the other line and the stage are situated in various, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
One case does not have any sense that the game is still offering the same thing.
Some of the environment, moreover, are a lot of fine on the surface, although the technical level grafiky corresponds to the previous series of works.
So this is nothing to write home about.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the mountains zasněžených looks visually very pleasantly.
The race, moreover, are from time to time zpestřeny an atypical element.
In the desert, so, for example, přimotáte in sandy storm, which greatly reduces visibility.
By contrast, in the mountains, you have to be careful that you nezasypala flurry of.
In addition, they are well behind nasázeny individual plants.
It 's not just a few types of, but it is enough.
The moment was so dedicated to předjet the required number of rivals (essentially a classic race), then again, you are the time (a classic duel with stopkami) and then are waiting for you to duel with the only rival.
In fact, even from time to time připlete and the police, which for your efforts even further inconveniences.
New passages are outside the vehicle.
Rather, it is not just about such interactive animation, when Jack majority before someone prchá and you him in that you have to help, so that in the right moments tisknete right buttons.
Nothing complex.
But the surprise, that these passages in the game is much less than you would expect (specifically, perhaps even only three).
As a result, but it is a good thing, because this one does not have the chance to otravným and in the context of this grows, so one of the elements that game zpestřují.
Driving the model it follows in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that in today 's time, it is certainly not kdovíco, but it cannot be said that he was záporem.
If you 're looking for a realistic simulation of future, you will have to look elsewhere.
But akčněji pojatému compete here driving model suits are still quite well, although, in a competition to find a better.
Thus far, so all in all right.
But the problems are beginning to emerge for some time.
Unlike model schedules are already much in order is not a model of the rules of conflict.
Since the game of this type, we do not expect that spočítá complex distortions and collisions, but when virtually no before the crash into any object you do not have the slightest idea, how is your car does, then perhaps it is absolutely everything in order.
Typically in the narrow předjíždění or míjení cars in day - to - day operation of the sometimes only slightly mutually olíznete, but sometimes in almost identical situation ends up your car in wild piruetách.
Or even flat napadrť.
Thanks to a system of restartů that while not particularly perturbed, but rozladí you can reliably.
Restarty are resolved so that if rozmlátíte or out far off course, suits you game back to last a clue to the track.
But restartů is in every race available only five.
When it is vyčerpáte race, you have to start again from the beginning.
It is rather a gadget in case something goes wrong, than that you can rely on them downright.
But sometimes even restarty will help resolve is up to the need to learn to the section of the plant by heart.
Great neduhem games is that the same things often takes place on the same places.
Some zatáčky so it is, for example, the need to drive through a specific way, otherwise they simply nevejdete.
Sometimes you meet on the ground “ civilian ” are always in the same configuration whether there you go first, pátí, about five seconds before or about a minute later.
Naštve particularly in situations where you can see how between two protijedoucími cars opponent before you easily pass, whereas when you are no longer dojedete vehicles in a position that is you have to run or put the brakes on.
It is one thing when they dojedete, because it is “ spočítáno ” so that the situation there was always just before your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
For all the time you are playing in a few places, where you are, once again, regardless of the time, always předjede the same opponent in the same place.
Most of this praští at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you go in protisměru.
An opponent has been there before you must get obviously, hopefully, at any price.
When it goes before you, so you worse is an overview of the protijedoucích cars, so they initially had some pretty rozmašírujete.
We can understand the intention to do the game and exciting adrenalinovější, but implementation is so obvious that you can reliably quickly get frustrated.
And this is a pity, because despite the simple driving model is playing entertaining and at times even enough action, that sometimes literally nestíháte monitor, where what lítá.
And it is in fact one, whether on the merit of the concept with padesátkou unikátních lines, classification plants so that nuda had a chance, or anything else.
Non - traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You have to be careful at the gasoline pump for journeys, because that is where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases, vystačíte with what it is you are.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporťáky are appropriate in urban areas, a strong american bouráky to equal highways and exotic supersporty on technical - driving, for example, after klikatých mountain roads.
With the main příběhovým regime goes hand - in - hand, mode challenges, which are racing in various locations, of which you are aware of the story.
Here are given not only the medals, but also zkušenostní points to his profile, which is common to both the challenges and the story.
To gain a higher level of drivers are odemykají various objects: starting with cars and finishing with pozadími for profile.
At the same time, he is once again linked to online functions Autolog, which, among other things, comparing your achievements of other players and carries out another community functions.
One of the other, obscure kopanců is the situation of the last race in the story.
With their vehicle, you go into the subway tunnel (is), where they are rushing us in the dark on the tracks (is).
The tachometer you blinking for figures between 150 and 200 km / h (is) and in the rolling přiřítí analogous set the subway and uncompromising you sešrotuje.
In the bureau, and perhaps even in a few days will hold a debate about whether to create the game really no one even a little nepřemýšlel, or whether we have the authors for the really big blbce.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the visual impression is in most cases very congenial and, in a few cases, even the great.
Zamrzí so that in some vypjatějších moments is falling imaging, and in some cases quite tragically.
This concerns, but, above all, bouraček with a greater number of participants, where would you steady imagery was already done as valid.
Zvuková site is in order and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In a bid to attract the widest possible range of rather a younger audience a soundtrack of the category of “ every dog other village ”, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music the game around just someone to buy it.
The overall impression of the Need for Speed: the run is so greatly puzzled.
If the game completely avoids unnecessary mistakes, then we would say, fearing that the run is the best bit NFS over the last couple of years.
In this way, but the game is nedodělaně.
Entertainment that is certainly good, but prepare for this, that you will be třískat mistakes by the force of the airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativistů and Eurosceptics
“ The Lisbon Treaty quite significantly undermined the balance between individual institutions. ”
“ I expect that it will be a hard war. ”
“ It will take five, six years before the situation stabilises calms down a bit, and before we all players used to his new role, ” began its tough a lecture at the law school, the czech ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová.
As much as its motto “ clearly and openly about Europe ” takes seriously, has shown no longer in the first part of a lecture, when it was able to describe the EU authorities and their relationships so transparent and understandable way, that it would cause many lecturers from the law department of UK envy.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“ The first was a criticism that is unremarkable, that it is a grey official, that can play a role, and I have to say that all the ton steam that is the role he managed so well. ”
“ This is someone who knows how to listen to 27 Member States, brilliantly communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go. ”
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: “ who is that the European Union? ” to which a phone number, I call? ”, that is, as a significant step towards unification and greater legibility of EU policy against states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban syrečky
Vicenová has also addressed the agenda by the European Council lived, live and will live in the near term.
The Czech předloňské Presidency deemed a success.
The Czechs address emerging financial crisis, solve the crisis the gas or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government in this time, then as a huge liability, which the Czech Republic very heavily damaged.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very napilno.
In the words of the ambassador, “ frmol ” was not just the presidency, however, and the subsequent financial crisis, which is addressed to date.
In addition, has yet to approve the new seven - year EU budget, which is precisely because of the current economic situation complicates matters greatly.
Whether it will be a lean budget and austerity, that the sector will get preference, which country will be paid more and less, all of this is on the agenda of the coming negotiations.
The ambassador and the recall of its main slogans, which came in Brussels: “ clearly ” on Europe.
“ I really like the ugly shortcuts, foreign words, hantýrku that nobody understands.
As a citizen, to understand that we are truly in Brussels nevymýšlejí zakřivené or big cucumbers, bananas, in different ways, and large or that anyone really needs to ban syrečky. ”.
It also wants to make better use of EU environment and get more czechs to european institutions.
We are facing a multi - speed Europe
According to the ambassador czechs have a reputation of eurosceptics and people who are noticing more negative than positive aspects of the issue.
In addition, it pains low representation of the Czechs in the european institutions.
The culprit, according to her a lot of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write letters to the motive, but also the low support from the party.
In addition to the success of the Presidency, highlighted the strength and cooperation visegradské quartet.
“ Believe me, that when it comes to me Pole and hungarian and is approaching Slovák, so the Frenchman next to me said: “ hele, what they meet what not yours visegradská the quartet? ” and not at all on this netváří enthusiastically. ”
In the future, according to the Union Vicenové waiting mainly tough new rules for budgetary policies of member countries.
As a very real then sees the concept of a two - speed, if not a multi - speed Europe, rather than a new “ european federation. ”
“ We have here a country in the euro area and the countries outside the euro. ”
“ We have the Schengen area, we have and the Institute of enhanced cooperation. ”
“ For the first time, it was said, they are working only countries that want to, and those who do not want to see whether stand idly by. ”
“ Those institutions will be more, and it will be a two - speed Europe, ” expected Vicenová.
In this regard, also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcement of the principle that have all the issues that have an impact on the whole of the Union, discussed among all member states, not only between the countries in the euro zone.

Inovátor IBM begins the second century of existence
If someone searched for a word, which accurately express strategy of IBM, the closest would be “ long - term aspect. ”
For the general public to IBM, a symbol of the technology revolution, is that the firm was seen as a very contemporary, and yet from its inception has passed a hundred years.
The basis of this long - term laid the first head of the company 's visionary, Thomas J. Watson sr.
He no longer forging a slogan that many of the world 's problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think.
His slogan “ Think! ” happen otiskem, around which will take on a life of future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine, which in IBM has already started to come back in 1935).
It was also the basis for Watson carefully built corporate culture.
“ For us the IBM means long - term thinking continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered a hundred years, due to the fact that has remained true to its fundamental values and at the same time was not afraid of everything else around change.
This allowed us during our first centuries to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second hundred that manage to achieve even more, ” remarked on the anniversary of the current head of the firm 's Samuel J. Palmisano.
The sophisticated system
Watson in the 1930s, made to care for their employees like businessman Baťa finely - people from IBM should as some of the first american employees paid leave, insurance from their employer plus elegant employee his uniform and the sophisticated system to reward the best inventors, and traders.
As a sophisticated has long - term IBM and the relationship with the customer.
The company has been since the beginning of the brilliance in the exploitation of the talent - as one of the first global companies canceled any discrimination, so I could pick.
In accordance with the strategy of anti - discrimination is the current plan, that Palmisana headed IBM in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
At IBM has been operating for more than 30 years, still holds the position of borrowed from the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years is doing so - called jamy, online brainstormingy, of which there is a lot of future strategies and innovations.
It is no surprise that the ideas are enough - in a company working almost half a million people.
Institutions with good name
The firm 's position in the business of providing the company' s strong internal and external image.
“ From the beginning, IBM was the concept of institutions, rather than just technology companies, ” said Economistu professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on the IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“ IBM is not a technology company, but firm, which helps solve byznysové problems for the use of technology, ” said George Colony of the consultancy firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, is the difference between the market and enter the market straight to create.
IBM - aka “ the Great Blue ”, as it is for its logo in the United States familiérně dubbed - for a hundred years, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is probably nejvšestrannější technology company, is developing the hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting and consultancy services in the range of products from websites for nanotechnology.
Holds most of patents from all US technology companies and five of its staff received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions belongs to the ATM, payment card, financial swap, a bar code or disketa.
IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year has become the second - largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, surpassed Microsoft.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations have trefily to taste customers and time - IBM, for example, nepovedla bet on its own operating system axes / 2, online services prodigy or computer IBM PCjr.
“ If your business is built to move forward, you cannot be emotionally focus on the past, ” poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM does not have a problem to build its foundations on many platforms - and when not working, so it is to leave.
The difference to be from rival Microsoft, which essentially stands or falls on the Windows operating system.
Promising technology
In sales, IBM is most engaged the services, after roughly a fifth of is a software and hardware.
Meanwhile, back in 1990, with more than half of the strongest representative of the hardware.
Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
In investment continues even since 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis.
IBM is according to the legacy of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the amount of investment.
So far, it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis intact.
The stock price of IBM since the beginning of 2008 has risen by rocket 120 per cent, net profit companies continually rising.
Corporate slogan, IBM is changing everything, not just its values.
We can therefore expect that, even when the next crisis, this giant flexible it will do.
IBM history: from kráječe cheeses for flights to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City 100 years ago, initially had complex Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation 's name.
The name of the IBM took up in 1924 - originally a label used in the company 's offices in Canada and South America.

Watson was for the company as indispensable, that after almost 40 years in šéfovském seat it was followed by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
Under his leadership, IBM has started work on the development of artificial intelligence, made the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM to help NASA manage flights to space - on merkur, Saturn and in 1969, the famous years man on the moon.
In the meantime, in 1964, developed by IBM 's first family of computers - a series of IBM System / 360.
Classic “ pécéčko, ” which has brought about a standard computer then, with the title of the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought konzultantskou part of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to fully pay advice and services with high value - added.
The strategy, which has in the past three years, IBM pays - is the concept of Smarter planets, “ Smarter Planet ”.
Its aim is to the smart use of technology in still need or unintended areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport, or the management of the cities.
For the trade has introduced recently IBM Smarter Commerce “ platform ”, which traders helps manage the business cycle.

Iveto, a donkey to leave, no longer do not want to!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
Then, as from her husband Joseph rychtáře (53) has become not only a protector of Iveta Bartošové (45), but also milenec, Darina still hoped that Joseph from the pink dream wakes up and will return home.
But now is not going to wait and into another life set clear rules.

Yet, that Iveta on its insistence that after 30 days of Říčan odstěhovala, pepa zpěvačku leaves.
Even publicly acknowledged that it loves.
The passage of time Darina resigned, the relationship between her husband appears to acceptance and now even gave him goodbye forever.
Rychytáře in limbo, with whom his wife sleep
If rychtář with Bartošovou, after all, only one break, at home it open homes to wife will not wait.
“ This is the biological father of my sons and, if it is going to live to see his life in our common house, no one will not be driven out. ”
“ Would live to see it but not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as someone with whom I have some links, ” Rychtářová disclosed that since her husband drew and lasts only for mutual decency.
Josefovi that he Darina has shut down a rear vrata, meanwhile, never mind.
“ I respect the decision of the wife. ”
“ With Ivetou will and I am not changing this. ”
“ The wife has set up a paper marriage and I respect that. ”
“ The company goes further, responsible for repairs, garden, a property nakupuji. ”
“ We are talking with Darinou completely normal akorát, that we do not share a bed together, ” said blesku rychtář.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, will not be told in to defend.
“ Nespíme together, and I do not want to know where it is, with whom it and if it has a friend.
I know that this is my fault, I zamiloval into Iveta and I am shouldering the responsibility, ” concluded Joseph.
The worst of the female vices: relate to you?
If you ask men whether they would have been able to name any of the typical female vices, usually all in one is very swiftly vysypou from the basement.
Ladies, are reflected in the next can read, where it is mentioned a few female zlozvyků, which can men perfectly pump up the blood?
Shopping
Accused you of your second polovička, that you are dependent on shopping?
You will have to buy at least one hadřík a week?
Would you buy and en masse in slevách?
In your case, then we can talk about buying as a habit.
Some women realize that would have had their nakupovatelskou passion at least a bit tame.
But tell, which would resist this, I just go to shop with clothing, look for the well - fitting svršky and then it all (preferably in different color provedeních) test in kabince?
Even if it is for the majority of women shopping hobby, for men, it may be literally total hell.
Just remember how many times you have it my said, whether you prefer to wait before the door …
Persistent dissatisfaction
“ I am not power tlustá? ”
“ I would need to lose weight, at least five kilo - I would have had to start practicing? ”
“ Líbím those at all? ”
Resembling the sentence you something?
That yes?
Then belong to those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop to be careful, but a lot of men is directly alergická on how their partners are constantly complaining about its appearance.
A stronger sex also agree that what the frequency of this stěžování increases, the women are otravnější.
Order and purity in the first place
This is like a never - ending a fairground carousel.
Rinsing windows, siphoning off, vytírání dlažby, utírání dust, drhnutí bath - and it at least twice a week.
Vyčítáte partner, that have stepped foot on the dirty clean dlažbu, children, that zašpinily vydrhnuté umyvadlo and opatlaly prosklenou obývací wall, with which leštěním you have so much work?
In the event that you suffer precisely this “ aberration ”, try to remember that nothing is the enemy of the good and order and purity definitely should not stand in the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for the purity of may endanger your relationships and the family 's well - being.
Rýpání
“ They used trenýrky cast in the bin. ”
“ Those old sock, you will take you tomorrow? ”
“ Mokrá utěrka, after all, does not belong to the ground. ”
If to its partner in this way rýpete several times a day, I, so that it can reliably dial.
Of course, that this would you not bad, after all, you want to ensure that everything was fine.
Perhaps, if it knew men, women would have to have them quite so much rýpat …
Slandering, drbání
For some women are also own defamation, gossip, but also to insult and conspiracy against anybody.
Women are focused on the relationship, and so, like discussed things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us a little harmless gossip — or klevetu here and there will launch.
Hand on heart, it is their own almost all women.
But are the opposite of drbny of grain, which like and often drbají, perhaps the most despised each and are for their surroundings, mainly in the women 's professional team - particularly dangerous.

How have evolved prices tour since 1989
In 1989, was in the then - Czechoslovakia allowed only five state tourism offices: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The tour operator at the time, sold in the vast majority of cases, only selling holidays in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West has been very limited.
Czech tourists and travelling on holiday to the sea in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), to the Soviet Union (Crimea in Sochi on the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and in Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, then, however, the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, and the way the czech tourists in Yugoslavia have subsequently been very limited.
The great paradox of socialism, then it was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (i. e., also Čechoslovákům) individually allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
In that case, like a citizen of Czechoslovakia individually to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, so he needed from this country zvací letter, not otherwise be individual way possible.
The tour operator at the time, offering and trips to the West, but it would need to stand in front of overnight with spacákem or be in the office “ well - known ”.
Even so, however, was not out of the woods.
The so - called FX promise, which was a condition for the trip to the West, has been granted a “ politically unreliable people ” who could travel at all.
Czechoslovakia 's currency is not freely convertible currency, without the promise of foreign currency and it was not possible to obtain funding currency (western) on the way to the West.
By far the most often, however, the Czechs to take holidays at home, which was the result of a large number of chat and chalup, which the Czechs pořizovali and this custom survives to this day.
Travel the Czechs and has experienced since 1989, the real revolution.
While in 1989 was leave in the GDR or Bulgaria our best last year spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
A great irony that are already aware of what it is, in fact, that for us at the moment most popular Croatia was possible in 1989 to travel freely, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Early in the 1990 's, there has been a visa waiver to neighboring west european countries, which was triggered by a huge wave of short - term visits, above all, the austrian Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs and Slovaks has long could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone there would at least for a moment look.
For example, in Paris sleeping trips the Czechs in parks in tents, because our then - income nedovolovaly, so that we can pay for a hotel or penzion.
A typical feature of travel Czechs was in this time of vození own food banks, salámů, etc., in order to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible, the czech koruna, thus our tourists could, finally, after many years destítkách freely buy western currency.
Our standard of living, and with that, however, the average pay rise, which ended around 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel to travel agents regularly since 1997 to prepare for trips charterovými air spoji, making air travel because of the possibility of nasmlouvat quantitative sales compared with the past incredibly less expensive.
At the end of the 1990s, we should have the Czechs visa - free travel in virtually all of the world 's advanced countries, in addition to the US, which continues to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post - revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when he was due to the significant demand vypraven from the Czech Republic 's first ever direct charter to exotiky, it was in Thailand.
From this year, so every year vylétávají with czech tourists direct chartery into warm distant countries, this year 's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic in the twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visiting already around 100,000 Czechs per year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which stands for our post - revolutionary development, came in 2008.
17 November 2008 abolished the US visa for czech tourists and this is our country definitively as one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, also for the first time in the history of the Czechs have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%), and for the first time in the history of it spent on one foreign holidays, including the cost of the whereabouts of more than 15 tis. Kč per person.
The General Assembly of has to find the President again but threatens stalemate
Almost five months is the czech football without the president and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Haška at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburce.
Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral law will proceed.
Without it, or begins to vote on which of the three candidates will be chosen.
Interest to lead the Czech football have Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June and in his retirement urged colleagues to get together and find a strong personality, which would result in football in the future.
But in an era of after Haškovi football slipped lately back to tit between the two chambers of the former, which was unable to agree on a common candidate.
Most of it is shown on 16 September, when a new president should be chosen.
Delegates at the shareholders meeting in the national house in Prague on Smíchově sjeli unnecessarily, since the negotiations remained blocked and this was not just a way of elections.
There is not a consensus, who has the right to a pile of actually vote - if only the statutory representatives, or even officials mandated full power.
In the only point since then a partial agreement, which will also help the recommendations of the constitution for the state and the right to representation on the basis of a full power is not possible.
The disputes but still exists about the electoral law.
Too much clarity on the situation and introduce an executive committee, who is no longer on their negotiations, whether proper or emergency, does not in fact nothing else.
A glance at the choice has changed several times, but neuralgický point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to ruled out the possibility of stalemate?
“ The dispute is whether to be in line with the statutes, or to find a different model, ” said one of the three vice - presidents FAČR Dusan Liberty, which in leadership Association represents professional football.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round of the wins the most of the candidates, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, for which is running.
Moravia is said to be ready to go at the concession that won the candidate who gets higher sum per cent of votes from both chambers.
And the party is pushing for a condition that the winner must in the percentage of the census to gain at least a two - thirds advantage.
“ But this would then pozbývala sense of two previous rounds, it would be completely negate a bicameral concept, ” sees the objections moravské Party freedom, under which it would be the best law neohýbat and to vote under the existing statutes.
With the somewhat surprisingly agrees and Tomas Paclík, although it is estimated that 's designed to allow the election law suits from all the candidates most Peltovi.
“ I wish to decide upon a maximum according to the constitution. ”
“ To some espousing nonsense nevymýšlely as the last general meeting, ” said owner of Victoria plzeň, who is running for the first time and in your comments are defined by, in particular, against Peltovi.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburce according to him, will be the new chairman of I know and believe that the candidates will in future work constructively.
“ All the passion to reassure potential of today 's action as a national team at the European Championships. ”
“ Football, in turn, will be a lucky streak, will have a greater willingness to cooperate, ” means jablonecký leader myself, which has three of the largest of the whole experience of managing a football as a professional, and regional level.
Rajchl is restrained.
“ I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is a lot of torn apart. ”
“ This is not among the people of the Czech and Moravia, but there are efforts by the ring to adapt to the legislation. ”
“ It can cause that to deadlock on shareholders meeting will happen again. ”
“ However, I hope that common sense will prevail, ” said Rajchl.
The agreement of all parties have much time left.
Some of the negotiations, were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows, whether in the struggle will be football generalita not complete.
The aviation speciál, in which should go to Podgorice, among other things, the Vice - presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, from Prague due to a technical disorder morning neodletěl and to look for is spare option, as part of the Executive Committee in the scenes of barážové retribution again.
Perhaps in the end will be decisive meeting at ministerial level, which can be reported on Wednesday.
The education minister, youth and tělovýchovy Joseph Dobeš would like to make divided parties within the strongest sports associations in the country to an agreement.
At stake is a lot of things: the state subsidies, the credibility of the football and also planned a pile of the vast ČSTV, which will address the new direction of the sport after financial problems sazky.
Paclík goes to fight on the president, because they cannot see a suitable candidate
If the head of the players' plzně Tomas Paclík before a large pile of extraordinary saw a strong candidate who would comply with all his ideas for a new chairman of the football associations of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor in the battle for the top post sign up.
“ If there is a high - quality adept, bojuju for him and the election of nejdu. ”
“ But in the current situation is not such a failed to find, ” said ČTK Paclík.
In the runoff with Miroslav Peltou and Jindřichem Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Peltovi, alleged favoritovi elections, tried to avoid in the road to lead FAČR.
Paclík also points out that, in the case of his victory in the role of the President lasted only until 2013, when it is on the agenda of the General Assembly of the good.
In this post, I would like to see in the future, as an experienced and top executive, who is not connected with the football events.
“ With some of the people who would come in the account, I talked to you. ”
“ For me it was crazy, though some said that at this point, with the czech football don 't want to identify. ”
“ That I would like to change, ” he said.
Paclíkovi supposedly now most of all it bothers Peltovo connections with the President of plzeňského Regional football association Berbrem Romano, a man with a reputation as a controversial, which is behind the scenes, known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates at the general meeting.
For Paclíka is so unacceptable to Pelta appeared in the position.
“ If he won, so the zakonzervuje the status quo and nothing would have in football moved forward. ”
“ In combination with the support of Berbra, which is zdatným trader, would that football was not even more, ” said Paclík.
Alluding to the fact that Peltovo name years ago said in tapping in the investigation of corruption affair, from which Pelta, however, came without punishment.
“ I do not know what the prestige of the football Peltovo victory would bring. ”
“ And as we also looked in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA, ” said Paclík, which already but also takes with grace its earlier statement that would “ plzeňský sold the club to Pelta became prime. ”
In the event that the Paclík in Thursday 's election triumph, could do but with Peltou envision the future cooperation.
The same thinking and another candidate Rajchl, which supported zářijovou Paclík before a large pile of, which ended in failure.
“ He (Pelta) would be the first, for whom I would go. ”
“ It has a great ability. ”
“ Could I would imagine it to be as the head of representation. ”
“ But manažersky would follow Association has failed. ”
“ I also nestrkám nose where it I can 't, ” said Paclík, which in September, has received a great deal of attention to the fact that he was behind the cancellation of the Commission' s rozhodčích in the head with Luďkem Macelou, which replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík argue that would lead to the association.
It refers to the ability of management of private companies, since last summer also heads the educational, which with its support in May celebrated premiérový ligový triumph.
“ I have the strength to take in the football environment something changed, so that contributed to his some cultivation. ”
“ To limit the effects of certain interest groups, which must have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which goes to the unsavoury situations, ” said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to sparťanskému boss Daniel křetínskému.
As one of the priorities would also found the tightening of relations with the czech FAČR Olympic Committee, through which it for political leaders lobbied for it, to get into the sport has received more money from loterijní taxes.
“ This is one of the key things that should be the new chairman of pay. ”
“ If it comes to the taxation of hazard to declare their political parties, so I understand their argument, but frankly to say where the money will go, ” said.
As a burden now Paclík takes nor its link with plzeňským club, though he claims that the President FAČR should be “ bipartisan ”.
Pelta, meanwhile, is associated with Jabloncem, Rajchl with the Prague Duklou.
“ It 's not ideal. ”
“ But I do not see any sense in to someone get transferred their shares in plzeňském club and a year - and - a - half there is back, ” said Paclík.
Pelta promised the new statutes FAČR, which would eliminate the election standoff
Two days before a large pile of Football Association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised that, if elected, to work, to be FAČR new statutes, which would in future be definitively eliminate disputes over the electoral law.
Jablonecký official is ahead of Thursday 's negotiations in Nymburce optimistic and believes that the election fight significantly dampen the success of today' s national soccer team.
Pelta before zářijovou neuskutečněnou choice has promised that the entertainment and obtaining financing, if elected, intends to focus on.
Before the last elections in a large pile of decided to go at the last minute, and so he can throw a two - month delay to its view of the management of football defended and presented in a wider context.
“ People at all levels of football has been doing a lot of time and expect that, on Thursday will be chairman of the unknown. ”
“ We do feel that it is high time for the Association of someone has led, ” is a man who is associated with particular jabloneckým club, but that for many years served in spartě and the executive committee of the Union.
And therefore believes that it has enough experience to the czech football managers.
He is convinced that the current problems with the choice of the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Haška.
“ Unfortunately, in the June general meeting were enacted statutes that are not as perfect as we all thought. ”
“ If nepřipouštěly different interpretations, President, we have had since September, ” Pelta pointed out.
It is an overhaul of the most important document civic associations with the book as delegates.
“ If the president of the tent, I take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to deliver a personal responsibility, if this does not happen. ”
“ It is a matter of principle, without which we can be, ” Pelta said.
And, he argues, is trying to nevymezovat against its rivals.
We have already announced that they will be able to see cooperation with Jindřichem Rajchlem, which recognises právnickému because of his education, and he knows that his opponent was his first vice - president.
Long neútočil or Tomé Paclíka, that, on the contrary, to Peltovi thread to dry.
“ Football is a little over a year, has had some successes. ”
“ His attacks, however, were unworthy and a lot of people in a way the election campaign caught off guard by. ”
“ And this is why a number of them are now doubts about his true nature, ” he said in the address protivníkovu Pelta, which supposedly remains committed to proclamations, which announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is on his knowledge of football from the lowest competing to attract.
This should be a showpiece of football.
“ And also I would have tried to put an end to all the affair from kauzou Bohemians or echoes of last year 's corruption scandal. ”
“ Then I would be going to negotiate with the state and the private sector, to ensure enough money for the whole of football, ” said ČTK šestačtyřicetiletý candidate two months ago.
Then also promised that his arrival at the head of football would mean no personal cleansing.
“ I would have to be first to identify the individual employees, ” the message on Strahov, where from the long anarchy is understandable anxiety.
In spite of the current disaster scenarios, which is accompanied by the general meeting of the intended, believes that Thursday will delegates to Nymburka unnecessarily.
“ If it is the only point of contention is how I will vote in the third round, and despite that we can move on. ”
“ Football needs credibility, and there will be the only way that will finally have, in turn, their leader, ” Pelta remains two days ago maybe a decisive day their funkcionářské career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that it would FAČR began to work hard
If it were to be the new chairman of the Football Association, the Czech Republic on Thursday 's general meeting as the Vice - President of Henry Rajchl, many people in the association said it would please.
Rajchl, promises that, in the case of his election will be hard work.
It wants to push through changes to the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for the football field.
It also promised to resolve the case Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football and bring in more money to continue the work that began with the previous chairman of Ivan Hašek.
“ As president, I would like to address the football as a whole. ”
“ From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA over representation, professional football, football performance after the youth. ”
“ But this is not to say that I would do everything yourself, ” he said in an interview for the Rajchl ČTK.
“ I am a team player and I want the executive committee distributed power, so that each member to certain areas. ”
“ And I will be handing out hard tasks that any this segment hnul football on a quantum leap forward. ”
“ Many people would probably not pleased, because it would have started to work really hard and not only to criticise the work of others, ” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement hadn 't thought about it, that would not stand again.
“ For me to know that I am doing 20 hours a day. ”
“ But I need to know that this will make sense and that he will have people who will be continually throw a spanner in the works and my question every step, ” explained why hesitated.
“ A lot of people but I said that I must not give up, because then it would give up and others. ”
“ This is the confidence that I cannot just throw away, ” he said.
What motivates him, and the continuation of the work, which began with Haškem.
“ For those two years, has done a great deal of work, and I do not want to now be scrapped. ”
“ They are nastartované processes, which will have a resonance to for a couple of years, and I would not like to be stopped, ” he said to the concern that, in the case of the election of the next candidate Miroslav Pelty, said the situation at the Union could return in time before Haškem.
“ I believe in a systematic way, and this is something that I think Mirek Pelta cannot. ”
“ For him, in particular, are navázáni people who would do the football, so that it was only for those vyvolené. ”
“ I can say a lot of things, but it certainly will not be with all that someone. ”
“ I try to be objective. ”
“ I want to do football for all, because then they will be all well and not just those vyvolení, ” remarked Rajchl.
Refutes the claim that it was only the Czech Prime.
“ Even though some people are trying to argue otherwise, so I plan to do for Moravia everything. ”
“ For example, it is time to think about it, that would be the second League split on the Czech and moravskou part, whose winners would go into the first League. ”
“ There has been, so the current situation, when they are in the league of only three moravské units, which is a problem in the direction of the young players in Moravia, ” said Rajchl.
As the fight over President involved, and the chief of plzeňského club Tomas Paclík, netroufá am Rajchl guess his chances in the election.
“ But still I feel strong support in the chamber, which I chose as his vice - president, and that to me is the clear successes, ” said Rajchl, which for their achievements sees saving tens of millions of poor kronor on contracts negotiated television contracts and negotiations on loterijním law.
On the contrary, it has been complicit in it, that the union netáhne to pull together.
While the Peltovi says that it is “ disqualified from it, to back the confidence of football ”, another contender Paclíka is considered a strong candidate, which is what football has to offer.
“ No one can dispute that, in educational over this year has done an excellent job. ”
“ If it were to be elected, so perhaps continued in those matters that have kick - started Ivan Hašek and does not materially, remained unchanged staffing in commissions. ”
“ I would shake their in their favour, ” assesses rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools of Europe
The jump in Blue
Julia Stanek
From the point of view of brouzdaliště ufona, luxury swimming pool in Budapest: who travels across Europe, can see their blue miracle - and after a search of the cities or travel to let their tired feet rest in termálních lázních.
Book shows, where is the most beautiful wellness in water.
When the iris Meder issued in the last one - and - a - half year to objevné trip was not allowed in her luggage miss: its swimsuits.
Ležíc naznak on water, vzhlížela in height to artistically built up kopulí, swimming, by contrast, mramorovým putti (figures in a small of a naked boy, the child (a winged)), which it waited on the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restaurované secesní plovárny.
If some plovárna liked, in an instant, it introduced into its zápisníku - even with notable details about how the building and the history of the building.
More than 200 plováren examined in this way, the historian architecture Meder and represents is now just in his book “ Badefreuden (the joy of bathing) ”: the people 's plovárny in Munich, the historic palaces plováren in Schwarzwaldu, “ the hard core of concrete buildings in Taunusu. ”
13 countries it has led the way for “ nejneobyčejnějšími lázněmi in Central Europe ”: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited the site in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 - year - old German is a genuine entuziastkou plovárenské culture.
The sport that power nepřehání, says Meder - only in the water that is something else.
The anger is not only that the fandové swimming must contend with blue kachličkami and congestion chlóru, while běžci for health can breathe omamnou smell smrkových forests or listen to veselému švitoření birds in the park.
“ One day, I ask, why plovárny must always be so šeredné ”, says Mrs Meder living in Vienna.
“ So I started to gather nice plovárny. ”
Water levels are duplicates architecture
Šplouchání in skokanském swimming pool and atmospheric oil for saunu - factor of well - being is so great that the concerns of all the senses, so Ms Meder.
And when the founders of trying, can be a real plovárny pastvou for eye: “ instead of floors has one spas water level. ”
“ It is both transparent, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the entire buildings. ”
All the optically duplicates: high klenba, checkered kachle, skokanská planks.
Maloformátový obrázkový union “ Badefreuden (the joy of bathing ”) provides to 190 website everything we need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical havens wellnes - inspired but, above all, the taste of jumping into modři.
Remarkable specimens appeared sběratelka plováren Mrs Meder during their search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful medicinal spa, a 100 - year - old spa Széchenyi in Budapest, found water with the contents of nitrates in the original krasové jeskyni (jeskynní spa in Miskolc - Tapolca) and thermal spa, whose swimming pools are filled with alkalickou water and are located in a building - shaped bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A wonderful spectacle, by contrast, offer many heated for no plovárny open - air in Switzerland and Austria. so far of what one is from curyšského nástřešního swimming pools in the eyes of the entire city, may be in the outside the pool spa in St. Anton looking at the snow pokrytý Arlberg - and: in the steam lázních is a window, from which it is possible to monitor the tourism on the ski sjezdovce.
Perhaps the most striking design swimming pool expects lázeňské guests in Längenfeldu: akvapark Ötztal looks as UFOS, which has just landed in Alpách.
Of the three up open basins in the winter of steam rising so far, as in the background of the mountains Ötztalu stands to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwaldu
Not in any plovárně rose sběratelce bazénů Mrs Meder lost chlóru into chřípí.
Many of the thermal spa are feeling after síře, spas Árpád in hungarian Békescsabě it stinks for domestic heating oil to the extent that you can hardly believe that he came into the spa treatments.
The stench of comes from medicinal waters with content alkalických hydrogenuhličitanů, which is almost black and whose usazeniny ulpívají on the skin, as soon as the only person vklouzne into the pool - somewhat unusual experience wellness.
But also one place was iris Meder in his quest for the fine spa disappointed: when I would like to visit the czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, stumbling to a closed terrain.
In 1902 architect of Dušanem Jurkovičem designed spas have since been shut down.
When Mrs Meder glanced collapsing windows červeno - white over - yellow secesní buildings, uviděla how strongly growing weeds between dlaždicemi.
The demise of the stood in contrast to the magical plovárně in Schwarzwaldu: in the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already been done three phases of construction; one can emerge only novorománské elements that come from its inception in 1844, but also maurskou courtroom in the style of the Alhambra, which were attached around R. 1900.
From the careful modernisation of 1995 is Palais Thermal popular lázeňským place znalkyně bazénů Mrs iris Meder, and not just because it comes from Schwarzwaldu.
“ It is a performance, to join such a diverse construction slohy into such a beautiful complex, ” says Mrs Meder.
The palace is ponoření in the thermal swimming pool probably marginal.
The agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank leaves check commodity trading
Christian Teevs
Deutsche Bank leaves his trade in agricultural commodities?
According to information from the Spiegel Online - appointed Josef Ackermann, a working group to investigate the effects of speculation for the world 's poor.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Federal citizens is clear: 84% of germans, according to one study, it is unacceptable that the banks speculated in agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two - thirds of those surveyed even demand to Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions of this trade resigned because the problems of the world 's poorest deepens.
This is the result of the exit polls from the Forsa mandated consumer organisations Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report, which Foodwatch presented in mid - October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, that the stakes for global commodities exchanges is driving the price to the tune of banks and therefore are complicit in the global problem of hunger.
The campaign defenders of the consumer is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank boss Josefu Ackermannovi, while also velkobanky as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similarly.
Originally, the commodity bets meant to traders insured themselves against price volatility.
In the meantime, but most experts agree that the participants in the capital market with an interest in high - risk trades to decouple from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest making profits.
Other than competitors in the United States responded to the criticism Ackermann: promised that will test the criticisms and said that none of the trade “ is not worth it, so that was a good reputation of Deutsche Bank held up on the line ”.
According to information from the Spiegel Online checking the international criticisms of the working group Foodwatch - Report.
By the end of the year, is to be closed control, then the results are presented the board of Deutsche Bank - along with the recommendation, as it has to be managed.
At the end of January to then representatives of the banks tell us what the consequences will draw.
In the end, it could be reducing commodities trade or even complete refusal.
Ackermann working independently on his image.
The head of the organisation Foodwatch Thilo Bode to welcome the report, but at the same time, stepped up its criticism of the financial sector: “ betting on rising food prices shows in particular drastically, as ruthlessly banks today are harmful to the common good. ”
Whether Ackermann as top bank lobbyist to honor obligations.
“ Deutsche Bank must cut from its portfólia all the items, which are used for money bets on food prices, ” Bode said.
“ Irrespective of whether Mr Ackermannovi for people suffering from hunger or on the reputation of Deutsche Bank. ”
Ackermannův view appears to be at first glance, as a surprise, but it is clear that koncernový head for a few months before his departure from office, I left the perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank has announced that the head of the board of directors differently than planned, to the supervisory board go away.
Odvrácením since the disputed the agrarian speculation could improve its image.
And the possible loss of need not worry, I should meet at the end of his successor.
Every second, investments in raw materials testified
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on manager.
So far, the shares are already more than 30,000 of Internet users in the campaign organization.
On Tuesday published Bode polled, in which the institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November enquiries 1001, people.
Just 11 percent of the perceived as a legitimate, that Deutsche Bank offers investment, with whom they are linked bets on food prices.
Many of the customers of the banks would be drawn also personal consequences if they learned that their bank accounts for such trades: every second, as a result of the exit polls testified all investment, on which the money flowing into speculation in raw materials.
43 per cent, warned the known before such a bank, 49 percent said that popřemýšlí deportation of their account and will move on to another institution.
The House of the 21st century in Vienna
Přestěhovaný Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with legs, crashes and happy endem: austrian Pavilion of the World Expo in Brussels 1958 earned the prize, has become in Vienna museem, remained empty and zpustnul.
It is now otvírán again as trade house.
When horuje for modern architecture, the post - war for clear forms, glass factory, courageous rozmachy and new construction materials, which are typical of faith in the technical advances, then it is the austrian Pavilion architect Charles Schwanzera for Brussels World exhibition 1958 succinct and famously example.
Schwanzerův Pavilion received then Grand Prix d 'Architecture for its light and vznosně operating the construction of the steel and glass.
The construction is still seen as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
Famous for the architect, also for the next World Expo Pavilion built of Austria.
With his legendary čtyřválcovým BMW - palace plus as the key carried out by - building in Munich at the end of the 1973 internationally famous for.
His trade as a temporary construction of the projected Pavilion after World expo station in Schweizer Garten in Vienna Südbahnhof (South) zrekonstruovali station, and it opened in 1962 museum of the 20th century - has been named as a “ house of the 20th century ”.
But the building was not appropriate for the museum, or space or technically - were missing from the walls for pegging the art objects, no satisfactory for the climate.
Yet it was used, as long as the art of any new kiosk in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and chátrala more and more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz Pavilion to rebuild, now carries the title of “ the House of the 21st century ” and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday night there will open up the Belvedere museum, which belongs to the palace, the first exhibition - happy intention in every respect.
Through the new beginning Agnes Husslein - Arco, which has become the new 2007, the head of the austrian galleries Belvedere.
Husslein - Arco, the historian promovaná art with a distinguished career, M. J. in youth krasobruslařka, later in the Sotheby 's, Guggenheimově museu and as a founding Director musea moderny Salzburg, pushed strongly reconstruction for politicians and památkářů opatřila, public funds and private sponsorship money and identified using.
In addition to the contemporary art should be exposed to the works of sochaře Fritze Wotruby through foundations, should there be a kavárna and bookshop, and had to be built to the office building.
Strict supervision, the low - budget.
To carry out was then Krischanitz ideal memberships.
Not only that, in a sensible way to rebuild and expand secesní construction of Joseph Olbricha in Vienna and won the competition, but because Schwanzera studied at the University of Vienna and technical Pavilion for him was “ an extremely important place ”, in which “ almost every weekend, ” examining the exhibition.
He knew the ancestral project and also knows the problems of the building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change the use of lost on their generosity and ease.
In the current reconstruction have been far greater problems: the building was “ katapultem for energy, ” says Krischanitz.
Profiles of window glass facades were replaced, used glass fibre vyztužené insulating glass and skleněná roof will be replaced by a special security glass.
Chladové bridges - steel nosníky were stepped up or replaced, and asbestos fill out ceilings rescued.
Two underground floor provide room for new uses, zapuštěný lighting the channel between the building and street lighting, extends to the entrance leads stone - almost novostavba, but still vznosný Schwanzerův pavilón.
The original front doors remain the same, the building is in the old natřena antikorozním červenohnědém barevném tone.
And even kinosál is exactly the same as it was before.
And all of this with a strict supervision památkového office and low - budget.
“ Often had to be found material, which is good and cheap and I also liked the památkovému office, ” says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor suterénu.
Despite all the pressures, the problems and the reconstruction of the building remains flexible and birds.
Difficult it was supposedly with pavilonem, “ who came here from Brussels, ” said recently Krischanitz, a typical “ drop - in - the - City - history. ”
Such architecture, is “ always on the wrong place ” and still wants to “ give the proper self - confidence. ”
In this case, but it is not a house of the 21st century on nepatřičném ground, as occurred urban happy coincidence: in the circle around Schweizer Garten, a completely new projektovaná “ urban neighborhood at the station ” with kancelářskými and residential homes.
And perhaps even more there will be other things to chance: the house of the 21st century could receive support from other Krischanitzovy construction, as sběratelka Francesca von Habsburg 's purchase of Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how it is heard, now dealing with the city on the neighbourhood to habitats in Garten Schweizer.

Risk is tangible
After the discovery of “ cells in Zwickau ” questioning the turkish media on Germany to the rule of law.
The newspaper even talk about “ bloody ideology ”, which now alive again.
The murder of eight small entrepreneurs of turkish origin and one greek in 2000 and 2006 had the right - wing extremist background.
In this report in Turkey and within the german - turkish population in Germany have reacted with fear and concern.
As for many german Turks to back the specter that has long been viewed as the dead: from arson in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right - wing extremist backgrounds.
In Germany, there is a xenophobia about it, though it was never in doubt.
Objevená right - wing extremist network, however, reveals the extent of which dimension long ago cannot see.
“ Alive again bloody ideology? ” read the headlines of the online edition of the turkish newspaper “ Haberturk. ”
“ The newspaper Sabah ”, by contrast, pointed out that one of the perpetrators should be the secret police agent service for the Protection of the Constitution and fear that also german authorities could be caught up in the right - wing radical quagmire.
The turkish community reacted coolly Germany: recall on the weekend demonstrations in silence before Brandeburskou gate victim of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, reminded the turkish community in Berlin, along with the german and turkish policy formal act of the 50th anniversary of the german - turkish agreement on recruitment.
In a very merry paints was stage - a common life as a history of success.
As a slap in the face to the there are reporting a few turkish media: “ gift of Germany to padesátinám ” is the headline of the article in the turkish web platform “ Haber X ”, which covers about the background of the murderous series.
Also edition of the newspaper 's “ Hürriyet ” for Germany to take to implement this intellectual connections.
“ It all starts with stink, ” reads the headline sloupku from Ahmet Külahci.
Highlights in it, that they were murdered by the people who pay taxes and its work make an important contribution to the recovery of Germany.
Nejkritičtěji is discussed in německotureckých internet forums the police and its success late in the search.
Why does it not occur to the german authorities have much earlier, after the suspects pátraly in the right - wing extremist circles, it is surprising the authors.
As with many showing at least rhetorically ready for use of the drastic funding: “ if there continues to be carried out activities so superficial, immigrants have nothing other than their own defence and armed. ”
“ This is perhaps the best self - defense. ”
“ The quality of the clarification and adequacy of punishing the whole network very strongly depends inner peace in Germany, ” writes “ selenium. ”
What it means, if the inner peace in Germany in danger, illuminate the bombings in Mölln Solingen and in the 1990s.
Photographs of spáleniště in Solingen is engraved on the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown here the Turks living more clearly that there is a real threat, and the Germans, distrust and distance can result in the right - wing violence
But assassinations have made on the side of the Turks evident feeling of reciprocity.
Not to repeat the mistakes of the past
In the turkish press was, above all, criticised the failure of Germany 's policy after the bombing attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to those in Mölln, who survived to visit.
After žhářském attack in Solingen soustrastný sent a telegram to Turkey 's state president, left, but on smuteční festival in Köln represent its Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkelem - Kinkel then in his speech calculated what charges the Turks odevzdávali.
Quite like that, as the value of the man to measure, according to a height of his taxes.
The current turkish news media shows once again how deep is distrust many german Turks in the polities.
In addition to the large - scale clarification and new evaluation of the extreme right - wing terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
The bank scandal in curyšského Lake
Nejdobrodružnější Bank has headquarters in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered in the financial crisis, almost bankruptcy and since then sliding down from one crisis to another.
Now it has a german compare.
The Axel Weber certainly thought.
After his noisy departure for the leadership of the Federal Bank happened in July, a well - known that arrives in 2013 almost as spektakulárního new job: President of the Board of the swiss velkobanky UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in their careers.
Axel Weber has enjoyed publicly praised the Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired the solidity and said friendly comments to future colleagues.
“ Die UBS has reached a turning point ”.
“ I look forward to working with Kasparem Villigerem and Oswaldem Grübelem. ”
But in September, it was clear that everything will not be otherwise.
One dealer from UBS in London has circumvented all safety systems of banks and around 1.7 billion euro zmarnil.
The head of the board of directors, Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland a respected banker, had to leave.
The president of the board of UBS is since then, as well as opařený - and we all ask: when finally comes, Axel Weber?
Already has become a well - known that Weber Bank since February 2012 may advise.
And the board will take over the presidency in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday to tell.
For Axel Weber this will be hard.
It is not a banker, a professor of economics and emission banker and certainly would not have time to translate the needed.
Then suddenly, will assume responsibility for the banks, which, in turn, could have just one that deserves the title of “ the bank 's biggest scandals in Europe ”
As UBS is both a huge - until recently was the biggest wealth manager in the world - and sliding down, on the other hand, has for years from one to another scandal.
Nothing, it seems, is proud of the Swiss Bank spared.
It started during the financial crisis.
In 2007 to enjoy excellent UBS 's reputation.
The image of mlčenlivého and solid, but also vychytralého manager property is combined with the ambitious goals: would also mean anything in investment banking.
So it managed UBS 2007 on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, a move as an investment bank in the league of the world 's biggest banks
That was the impression.
A former banker and later a long - term banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: “ my students at the time I always UBS cited as a model of good banks. ”
“ From today 's perspective, one asks: how I could so wrong? ”
It was wrong considerably.
In 2007, it was clear that for the first time, something in the UBS properly gone wrong.
In the middle of the year, resigned, surprisingly, the head of the board of directors, Peter Wuffli, which so far has been seen as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant bankers.
For a few months later I knew why he left.
The investment bank division has wasted Subprime - Securities and had to write off billions.
For it to defend, UBS is recommending the capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
It found a really investors, however, such that the recently even ohrnovala nose: opaque asian sovereign fund from Singapore and arab state fund, which was so discreet, that one man or nedověděl his name.
But this was just the first crash.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to admit a new billion - dollar losses, president of the board of Marcel Ospel, 2006 a second best - paid Board of Switzerland, to step down.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: UBS was due to his bad investments in the financial crisis, before they collapsed and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of questionable securities, the Swiss Confederation, has six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, which could become a spolumajitelkou banks.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - as we noted, as is dramatic for a small country, though he has on its territory and big banks.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland (see picture).
“ Once again we could save the UBS ”, says the banking expert Geiger.
On the first disaster follows the second.
For several months to have capitulated UBS in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to extradite data wealthy customers, who as possible with the help of banks krátili taxes.
In addition, agreed with the payment of $780 million - as the return of unjustified profits from these stores including pokutové surcharges.
The UBS has more or less openly that aided by cutting taxes.
At the same time, it has lost something, what has always been its capital in the competition for the rich clients: svatozář discretion.
After this scandal has already been the swiss banking secrecy what earlier.
It followed the resignation of the head of the board of directors and president of the board.
And the exodus of the money customers.
So the bank has lost in the space of a few months, their credibility in both core business areas: in the investment banking because of the bad speculation and in wealth management for helping to make cuts in taxes.
And just when it is a bit reassured, just when we thought that UBS will pick up again, here comes the ill - fated trade anabáze: a single dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euros before the Bank zpozorovala, that something is wrong.
And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking it probably still must be wrong.
“ The case is about Adoboli discovered that control of the risks of too little has changed, ” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at Finanz banking Institute University Zürich.
As well as financial director of the big german banks is certain: “ UBS problem lies in the fact that dealing with the control of risk. ”
He was, after all, is the idea of a caution that start off on the swiss bankers a long time ago to become the guardians of large holdings of the world: no too much risk, but security for money - also from this side of the Alpine republic, collapsed in the world.
Trezory swiss banks have become the symbol of an unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high - quality chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich is more suited to the clichés of good swiss private banks - is just a little bit more.
No location is a classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to curyšskému jezeru, which is framed zasněženými peak in the swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Klenotnictví as Tiffany 's to find between the swiss traditional stores such as ice Sprüngli.
For centuries, here is the home of swiss banks: from Nationalbank despite Palast der Credit Suisse after an elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The receptionist halls UBS to enter the heavy otáčivými doors.
Inside, the walls are obložené mramorem, in front of them a massive kožená seats, in addition to the logo big banks směrovka to “ safety deposit box. ”
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.
This idea of swiss banks both swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - out or they let down, as the head of finding one small swiss private banks.
His name would rather he did not want to read in the newspapers, finally closes, as all swiss bankers, also with two velkobankami shops.
UBS is perhaps too grown, finds - particularly in investment banking, where the extra spread anglosasové.
The Swiss may have to have something to say.
“ And if, after all, adapt to the long Anglo - Saxon ways. ”
Indeed it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, which UBS changed, leave it initially high profits and then disaster: no european financial Institute have not lost in the jungle around Subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank.
15 October 2008 disaster was obvious.
“ In the heart of the next coalition government, the country 's largest small sedmimilionové to rescue action in the history of our nation, ” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “ Der UBS - crash ”.
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euro approved politicians to rescue from bankruptcy - velkobanku.
How can this happen?
If talks with the swiss bankers, so they can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, have come together two of the three swiss velkobank into massive group.
A bank, which is already in a merger was too large to small Switzerland - and still continue to grow.
Meanwhile, benefited from that, with two different bank UBS predecessors complement: one rich, but ospalá Bank in Zurich with the focus in wealth management and poorer, but internationally heavily involved.
Suddenly lost internacionalizovaní investment bankers conveniently to many money with which we can make a lot of roulette.
With the rise of UBS are linked the two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“ I have always thought that Wuffli Ospel and are the team of the future, ” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
“ Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, that knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, one driven by sentiment around the stomach, which from banking science has produced entirely up. ”
But Ospel, he argues, to the end of relied on Wuffliho.
And Wuffli was probably made at the end of a crucial mistakes: “ perhaps the thought that his models are a reality, ” Geiger said.
“ This is a tragic case. ”
The tragic, perhaps.
What is clear: the hubris of prior to the crash.
UBS employees are clearly recall the meetings of the directors on which koncernový chief Wuffli repeated again and again the same slogan: bring the Goldman Sachs of mines.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She was saying “ League Tables ”, the waiting list, which documents the success of the banks of that time.
It has sought to UBS on the location of the very top.
A few steps it has succeeded in.
In trading in the currency and stock was part of the game is up.
Corporate advisers, who have been charged with stress, however, one weakness: úrokovém in international trade, in the language of the bankers “ Fixed income ”, perhaps there is a big gap for the biggest banks.
UBS has some gaps in US hypotéčních products.
To close the gap, determined to UBS to adventure, which it almost cost existence.
Hungry for growth, investing as the bank itself and it - based fund to ensure the risk to US investment Subprime.
Has unfolded in a massive machine, which securities přebaloval on America 's mortgage loans and to further - but I also himself left it risks.
Also, even when other banks have long sought a way out.
“ Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, where UBS buy ”, says the banking expert Geiger.
How much is eufórie, so deep a fall.
One manager for the second had to go, when attempts to ease a were more difficult than had been thought.
The position at UBS have become katapultovacím seats and to now be houpou.
Who leads velkobanku now has almost to reduce work.
Must find a strategy for the bank, which all near business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger has no idea: the end with the investment banking, the concentration of wealth management, a return to the swiss roots.
Not so much the Bank is (still) wants to go.
But investment - banking has severely cut, so it is now clear.
Next Thursday, wants the new head of the bank 's Sergio Ermotti to present the world its future strategy.
The 51 - year old swiss italian has been seen, in fact, not only as an interim solution, though, the bank surprisingly rozešla with the predecessor Grübelem.
In the meantime, pushed through a: has long - term deals to lead UBS, told curyšská Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to put back on the situation in the mid - 1990s.
3 500 places a dent.
But it will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What it wants to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has now asked.
Publicly but still says only that they had their Mrs ahead of a flat in Zurich.

Smart vrány are expanding in cities
In many places are seen havrani Field for the birds “ distressed ”: but the city long ago cannot be this highly intelligent animals to drive, say experts.
Some of them, like others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: vrány include for centuries to the image of the cities, yet in some municipalities are hoarding residents' complaints to nečistotě and noise caused by animals.
At the same time, it is not against “ troubled birds ” has not yet in sight to any device.
Ravens dirt around cannot be from cities already drive, said the experts on the first sympóziu on vránách in východofríském Leeru.
There is to advise the experts from the whole of the territory of possible considerations.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Defenders of nature odvozovali while problems cities also from an exodus of especially protected havranů field: the use of chemicals in agriculture in about the growing rate of destroying the traditional areas for life.
The persecution, increasing encroachment and chopping down trees to the typical hnízdění birds make life harder.
Vrány are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 hnízdících couples are among other things in vestfálském Soestu, in the north - west, among other things, in Jeveru Diepholzu and Achimu in Bremen, also in Leeru.
There has prompted the 2005 contested project of mass killings vran in the rural county of negative headlines.
Critics have called the catch animals into a trap for birds and ubíjení stopped for a particularly brutal.
“ Normal expulsions, for scaring, nothing brings, ” found so many urban planner and krajinář Werner Klöver from Leeru.
Removing hnízd stříkáním water or the felling of trees is often undesirable consequences, also said an expert on environmental Manfred Kaiser of Lahru while landowners in Baden - Württemberg.
“ The animals are receding, large colony is split and divide into other jobs. ”
For scaring it is conceivable as an exception for hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
“ We have to live with them, it 's gone. ”
Without the rest of the territory is the problem of urban address, was the view of the mayor of Wolfgang Kellnera from Leeru.
It is conceivable combination of expulsion of animals from sensitive residential areas and their crowd in, so that in other places settled.
“ The information board instead of knock - on drinking ” promoted by contrast psycholožka and etnoložka Uta Maria Jürgens due to a different treatment of animals: “ one uhřík facial can end the best weather with self - awareness. ”
Mrs Jürgens spoluzaložila in Schleswig - Holstein Ascherbergskou naučnou vraní Road, which provide information board lessons about the life of a highly intelligent havrana field.
The project is supposed to be, in the meantime, has already adopted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise caused by birds should Mrs Jürgens own view: “ we are talking about every volume of communication, I have a lot to say. ”
The intelligence and the acumen of animals are legendary: havrani field not only devices, to achieve pamlsku, but even as its reference tool zhotoví.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behaviour of the four havranech field, how far is intelligence birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that must stones mark the collapse of design, in order to get to the larvě jetty.
Without a major training to get to know the size and shape of must - stone bear, that caused the collapse of the platform.
In a second attempt to mazané vrány then solve the problem of weaker.
In svisle built válci researchers placed a small nádobku with larvou jetty.
Zobákem could birds on their prey to achieve.
However, the researchers asked them pieces of wire.
All four of them vytvarovala animals, a fly in the ointment, whereby a rod fish from trubky nádobku for držátko.
Three of the four field havranů did it even zásekem.

The massacre at a personal level
An emotionally strong new book, Peter Englunda with “ the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War (the Beauty and the Sorrow: an Intimate History of the First World War) begins a long list of speakers characters, when you from this zatočí Head.
One piece of advice, as they are in the moment: be careful to maintain this page vytrhněte and make it záložku.
All those, in románovém narrative Mr Englunda very well and look at this list you will serve as a beacon of navigation - as - at a time when they are the same as men and women in the story, you will feel confused and missing in various situations.
Mr Englund is a swedish historian and journalist.
There is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.
The book, which have been talking about here is very unusual - author himself has described it, rather aptly, as “ antihistorickou work. ”
It contains a number of very well - known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, in her nearly missing ambassadors, energetic, journalists and the debate about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as “ a book about what it was all about. ” discusses “ feelings impressions, experiences and moods. ”
“ The beauty and sorrow ” combines war experiences 20 more or less tuctových men and women, on both sides of the divide, from students and botaniků after horolezce, doctors, drivers záchranek and officials.
Some of these people have become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, zblázní or die.
Their lives are mihotají as flames of candles fervent in church - new added to spletence fates, while other uhasínají.
The book Mr Englunda from classic historical novels differ.
Regulates the idea that the First World War was just about the horrific entrenched fighting on the western front.
“ The beauty and sorrow ” zručně prozkoumává and other places where there was a wartime dramas: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, eastern Africa.
Soldiers in this book solves the problems with this, that they are falling bee hive, must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or are struggling with the presence of tse - tse flies.
Almost from the beginning, this is a very moving reading.
The war be absorbed in the lives of people like a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina páchnoucí střelným dust.
When in the distance starts shooting raised from the works and you are a woman who is at home with their children, utečete or stay?
Who is this actually coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even that, why was the war unleashed.
“ The vacuum created from a lack of facts, ” he observed Mr Englund, “ has been filled by estimates, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudice, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fámami. ”
“ The beauty and sorrow ” follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Nightingale Farmboroughová, english nurse in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the flotilla.
Their stories are all přebírány of biographies, letters and other already published materials.
Descriptions of their lives can be scary and poutavě, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are absolutely living and believable.
Many of them about suffering and dealing with him.
In the story of a german author says: “ substitutes, all the substitutes. ”
“ Substitute for a coffee, imitation, going aluminium, imitation gumy, paper obvazy, wooden knoflíky. ”
Goes even further, describing a substitute for eating in Germany.
It refers to the “ meat vyrobeném from pressed rice vařené in mutton fat (and supplemented by a false bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried bramborových slupek, shoes with wood podrážkami. ”
Mentions that there were “ 837 registered artificial meat in the production of párků and 511 registered a coffee. ”
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American in itself is internal incentives to divokosti and brutality, and then on the war says: “ at the end of the day, you will understand that it is human nature. not sit in a comfortable seats with a cigarette and whisky, večerními newspapers or a good book and pretend that this your Mask is a civilisation and that behind this škrobeným I in the heart of the secret of the fact no barbar. ”
On the contrary, a british soldier is aware of that, with the greatest probability soon die and no one has even won 't notice, let alone to mourning.
“ When you finally reconciled that is sacrificed, waited at least, that will happen in front of vděčného audience, ” she writes.
Instead, however, find it as “ convict who secretly oběsí. ”
Other comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the advent of new horrors.
“ The conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competition, ” writes Mr Englund, “ the war between the factories. ”
Received what is called “ a new sort of beast 's: výřečný and ideologically a staunch serial killer in Chanel střižených for peace, which carries out its bloodshed without rising from the table. ”
People behave quite unexpectedly, vileness, alternating with hrdinstvím.
Mr Englund describes, soldiers, who is from prostitutes deliberately tried to catch some sexual disease, to avoid service at the front.
“ Nejgrotesknějším example of this behavior was trading gonokokovým hnisem that soldiers were buying and curb the genitálie it in the hope that they will end up in the hospital, ” she writes.
“ Those are the most desperate vtírali even in the eye, which is often oslepilo until the end of life. ”
In this translation from švédštiny from Peter Gravese is próza Mr Englunda speedy, but not ostentatious, which is well suited to his human subject.
In dozens of small output captures the way in which the war unleashed a “ totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, religious hatred. ”
People are starting to ask, why is their leaders to fight.
The best books of the First World War, for the most part, rather than with the complex of a work with signs such as “ the First World War and the modern memories ” from Paul Fussella or a novel like “ all quiet on the western front ” from, Erich Maria Remarquea.
Mr Englund prefers nekonvenčnímu concept.
His book is the most devastating conclusion, as in populárně naučné literature is unprecedented.
You will, however, I will not be revealing.
You will, however, find, as would suddenly jumped from the book 's author, vytrhl you side from the list of heroes of the eye and set it.
After the previous error this time of one minute exactly planned raid
Part of it has hundreds of police officers, some in přilbách used in the street riots.
Overnight from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because it would by then be Zuccotti Park was nearly empty.
The action he knew no one except a few high - ranking officers. the other was first said that this is an exercise.
At the forefront of the action was Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence stressed how many problems to the police department in operation face.
Allowed to repeat cases in recent weeks, with, for example, to use pepřových sprays against protesters, which have been violated the rules of the department, and a wave of public sympathy spilled on the side of squatterů.
That is why the police operation, which was intended to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park, launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by proběhnuvšími operations in other cities.
The massive exercise for the case of behaviour in crisis situations took place in parts of Randalls Iceland, which has been preparing for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders stepped up the so - called training of riot - anti - terrorism measures including the rapid shift in large numbers of police officers, with a focus on the municipality of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training was held on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move into the park was literally “ at the last minute, ” said someone who has been action originally represented only as “ exercise ”.
“ I know a couple of police officers, who were in this action also called, and certainly no one has said that goes to Zuccotti Park, ” said the person, who spoke only on condition that will remain in anonymity.
“ That goes to Zuccotti Park, knowing only the highest - ranking members of the department. ”
One of the reasons the secrecy was the lesson for the city once was.
14 October should the leaders of the city 's plan to clean up the park, but then backtracked from the plan, because as soon as I heard it on the demonstrators,. them before the start of operations in the park for hundreds.
When the action involved police officers from various units, including the battle groups from around the area - dozens of police officers, who are routinely used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that during the day in the park are coming up and, in turn, leaving a large number of people, so one hour in the night was an ideal time for the action to start.
“ It was appropriate to do this at a time when it is in the park as few people as possible, ” he said.
Than troops knocking, seřadily is on the border of the streets Pike slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt drive, bridge near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of the emergency units with obloukovými lampami and amplióny.
Lights and nahraná report burácející from amplionů frighten many demonstrators.
When in the park have joined members of pořádkových units in its Blue větrovkách, many protesters are sbalilo their things and leave.
Police say that until 1: 45 on the morning of the touch of a single tent, which would give the protesters time to sbalili things.
Other teams of police officers were seen, as are collecting on the edge of the park, so that it could vniknout, if any was needed to carry out the arrests.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The main spokesman for the Police Department, Paul J. Browne, said that would be the case for their safety.
Many journalists, however, maintains that the police wanted to stop it, to see its troops in action, and in addition to them some police officers were grossly.
Mr Brown said that television vans on Church Street leading along the western border Park could natáčet without problems.
The police moved westward and proplétala with a myriad of personal items of protesters, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes for knocking them. teams from the sanitary department, which immediately shrabovaly everything in the park 's left.
Some of the demonstrators, who have refused to move, they were from the park vyvlečeni. dokumentující videos materials emerged soon after on the Internet.
Hardened group of protesters have resorted to the proximity of cuisine in their tábořišti, which lay near the centre of the park.
Some set up roadblocks and police launched their methodological arrests.
About 10 people at the center of the camps to mutually připoutalo.
And two people are přivázali to a tree, said Mr Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were called to přeřízli locks.
Until 3: 30 in the morning, the park has there been any arrests, said Mr Kelly.
The whole operation was completed around 75 minutes later, the sound of the police.
Mr Brown said that in the park were detained around 142 people.
Most of the arrests took place because of “ the riots and the resistance in the arrests, ” explained.
The most senior police officer at the scene of the action was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the most senior uniformovaný officer in the department.
The operation was personally involved in also T. Phil Pulaski, the commander of the detektivů on separation.
Mr Kelly was present, but “ involved in the management of operations, ” said Mr Brown.
The second group of police officers waited along the eastern side of Broadwaye, between the streets of Liberty Street and Cedar Street, for the case, that would be needed to bring the need for it.
On the street Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park and on the street pine Street, block south of the park, have been vztyčeny roadblocks.
From these places, then police develop protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point they were spatřeni police officers, many of whom have been equipped with shields, as crowds out people even further for the border.
On the northern border, about 28 people.
The actions of the wildest night took place just south of the park.
Around five o 'clock in the morning was spatřen one protestor just south of the pine Street, both jumped on the hood of a police car, and a few others, who vypouštěli air in the tyre police vans.
At one point, the crowd leapt piece of překližky.
At the end of the operation has been hospitalised one policeman and one protester.
The union of relief workers will be to sue the city because of the release
Unions representing hundreds of school aid workers, who last month have lost their jobs, on Wednesday plan to prosecute the city, saying that the layoffs were necessary, and it was about discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, which are visiting the poor students.
Court cases is probably the last option, which trade unions in the area of District Council 37 remains, in their efforts to overturn the decision of dismissal.
The 7th of October lost work six hundred and seventy - two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the lowest - paid employees city. their release, the head of union members described as revenge of the city for him last spring allowed access to fund health care spravovanému working četami, through which the city wants to filled a hole in the budget.
Officials in the city of this accusation flatly refused.
On the City Council, which took place last month, said the education minister Dennis M. Walcott, that layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately countered by saying that, in the budget is not mentioned anywhere in particular about the release of the aid workers.
Leaders of the urban part of District Council 37, has already announced that fills the necessary documents and warned the Education Ministry, that it will be to sue. on Wednesday svolají press conference, where formally announce its lawsuit in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Obžalovanými in the process, Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while prosecuting party will be eight redundancies, all of whom are afroameričany or hispánci, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomasová, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said that the city still have not seen before, and therefore to the accusations will not comment.
According to the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, with trade unions to focus on the number of redundancies in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claims of unfair negotiation. hold the view that the poor schools have lost more assistants, because they are already in the long term are deprived of adequate funding.
They point out that while in schools in parts of Staten Iceland nepropouštělo at all and in parts of the Upper East Side minimally, in Brooklynu, in part of the District 23 in Brownsville, have lost their jobs 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, there were even 46 assistants.
A reminder that in the School of Public School 36 in Harlem work lost five of eight assistants, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. indictment says: “ this is not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents, who may come from the financial resources to compensate for the shortfall in the budget. ”
The budget of the school, Public School 36 was reduced this year on 3,26 per cent and the school also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating bonusových finance for each přihlášeného poor student.
Unions argue, among other things, that the directors of the secondary schools could be confused by the way in which it was written document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
In the document was coined to describe the actions used the word “ excess ”, that is, to lift the position, even though that word is more often used to describe the shift of teachers from a charter school in a database available workers, whose salary is paid for by a central authority.
“ Sixty - six parental coordinators have been released, ” the motion states complaints, “ and not only moved into the database for the position of the available workers. ”
The mission is at an end, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed on something, in terms of the uprising in Libya.
Before that, however, has had to revolution to succeed, for a long time, the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the troops the United States closed.
On Tuesday, the Commission for international relations to the Senate to decide on the comments, which supports Chairman John Kerry (Mass.), along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which should congratulate the Libyans to their successful uprisings and american troops to thank for their “ bravery ”.
“ This statement we want to pay tribute to the courage of the people of Libya, who started with rearranging his country, ” said Kerry.
“ Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for democratic aspirations. ”
The sentence may look innocent, but no debate, which was about Libya, until now, has not been easy.
Over the years, lawmakers from both parties are constantly arguing among themselves and with the White House on the wording of a series of statements for approval, or the military 's refusal to the role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, presented to Kerry and McCain resolution authorized the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
A proposal in the House was rejected because of the differing views of both political parties, so it is in the Senate never vote.
But the same day, when he was in the House rejected this proposal, the House rejected the measure, which would put an end to the financing of US operations in Libya.
This is America 's mission in Libya was literally in the legislative očistci - Congress criticised the way in which President Obama directs the mission, but its members of this apparently nedráždilo so much to him in his actions to support.
The hesitancy of Congress eventually overtaken by events.
Rebels captured Tripoli in August and 20 October was killed Gaddafi.
Later, the mission officially ended on 31 October.
It is now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for international relations in a statement “ congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and the remarkable resilience, which have invested in an attempt to free his people ” and “ commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its allies, who have been involved in the operation to protect the libyan population, for the extraordinary bravery and professionalism. ”
In a statement, also “ confirms the national interest of the United States for a successful and nezvratném transition to democracy in Libya. ”
The new proposal will have the full support of the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators again divided into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June draft?
Against the latest version of standing up to Senator Richard G. Lugar (IND), the main representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugarův spokesperson on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has not yet seen.
In the House, will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be a top legislative priority almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlattem (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or else the topic on which will vote in the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far, despite considerable efforts have failed in their proposals through all the way up to the vote.
Goodlattův proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution, which were introduced in Congress and apply to a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - same proposal put forward by the House and Senate, and others are only small variations of the other.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of an amendment to a balanced budget and a handful of others, which would like to “ regulate federal spending. ”
Some of the proposals are not the same thing, but their supporters - especially the onset of Republicans, who want to improve its image - can brag about their “ ownership ”.
The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, demanded that the addition of a balanced budget vote in the House and the Senate.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of non - binding declaration of support for the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget wants to several members also discuss the limit on the number of times, in which members of Congress could serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N. Y.) wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the office of the president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a series of amendments that would, among other things, guaranteeing the right to a quality education and medical care.
A proposal remains amendment banning same - sex marriage and the addition of banning the burning national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancelling of federal laws in the case against them will stand up to two - thirds of the states.
Although it seems that are members of Congress in the design of the various amendments very active, compared with previous years, however, it does not significantly nevybočují of average.
In 111. Congress offered 77 additions, while in 100. Congress was 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics, the Senate members of libraries offer every two years, more than 150 amendments.
Not, however, a much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment, which has been added - 27. rider - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was designed by Congress in 1789.
“ Zmlácená, but not defeated, ” says Giffordová in his first television interview since the shootings
Ten months after it from the immediate vicinity of poranil shooter at a public meeting with constituents in Tucsonu, Gabrielle Gifffordsová (Ariz.) on Monday evening, appeared on national television, sing, together with the jingle from broadwayské show “ The Sun Will Come out Tomorrow ” and said that more than a return to Congress is on it to health.
Giffordsová appeared in order of the “ 20 / 20 ” on ABC News station with Diane Sawyerovou. it can be seen that the creation of sentences will still have difficulty walking in and needed help.
The entire board documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the injuries caused by the bullet, which it at the front to get through lebku, has left half of the brain and behind her came off the top of my head out.
Three months ago a surprisingly returned to the House to be a triumphant took part in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shootings, in which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, the Giffordsová smiling benevolently, smála and zpívala - with its recovery has described as “ difficult ”.
When her Sawyerová ask, how they feel, jednačtyřicetiletá Giffordsová replied: “ well. ”
The interview with Giffordsovou and her husband, Mark Kelly, the astronaut but was part of the hour speciálu portion of the agenda of the “ 20 / 20 ”, which was broadcast on the eve of a new book, this couple, entitled “ Gabby: the story of courage and hope. ”
Speciál watched the entire recovery Giffordové from firing on 8 January.
At videích, which natočil Kelly during the first week, it is possible to see Giffordsová in hospital beds with vyholenou head and a long scar across the front.
While her husband is encouraging, fails to at that time, more than just pick up one or two fingers.
A few months later, it is Giffordsová captures how sitting in a chair and therapists kolečkovém it teaches us how to implement the simple activity.
Pokývání head.
Vyšpulení lips.
And then, its first floor: “ what. ”
Within a couple of days Giffordsová made another word - “ toast ”, when dožadovala changes in their breakfast.
Videos odvysílaná broadcaster ABC show that a central role for recovery Giffordsové played music: Kongresmanka on them singing along with terapeutem to tune to písním “ Girls just Wanna Have fun ” from Cyndi Lauperové and “ Free Fallin ” ” from Tom Pettyho.
During the interview Giffordová, which pays for two hours daily therapy, Sawyerové revealed that the day of the shootings, nothing can remember.
Her husband said that Giffordové read newspaper articles about the shootings until March 12, when he first asked who she was six, who was killed in the incident.
From the shootings is suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missoury, where forcibly lodged under the influence of drugs awaiting trial.
“ A lot of people have died, ” said Giffordsová Sawyerové.
“ Terrible, terrible, terrible. ”
Kelly Sawyerové revealed that at one point his wife during the recovery has said: “ I have lost. ”
“ So I just said to her: Gabby, neprohrálas, ” describing the Kelly.
“ Not only are you got nakládačku.
But those that zvládneš, you have together and vrátíš is even stronger than ever before. ”
Military units have encountered sympathetically rather than with respect
The event was galavečerem on Wall Street, that brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who do not have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang baladu of helplessness, frustration and loss.
Since around him hundreds of soldiers, sailors, letců and mariňáků.
Solemnly oblečený crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
“ The men and women serving in the armed forces were regarded as heroes, ” said David Saltzman, who held a spring benefici.
The evening was also present, the then chairman of the Chiefs of Staff. apart from him on the ground, and Admiral Mike Mullen, however, saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
“ All have been presented as a band of orphans, ” the officer wrote in an e - mail.
I am sure that the organizers thought well.
I know that, yes.
But what I saw was not respect. it was a pity.
So completely opposite impressions just illustrate the uneasy relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the american public.
The army is bezbřeze included praise for their victims.
But this praise worth something, say soldiers.
The public is increasingly acts as if an individual in uniform regretted.
“ We are not at all victims, ” said Brigadier General B. Sean MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving Afghanistan.
“ It seems that the only way to some of us can support, is to put us in the position of the unfortunate soul. ”
This issue is very sensitive to the army commanders, who do not want to look like nevděčně or harm relations with the public, which serves.
We also recognize that anger, which have had to face the troops returning from Vietnam, once was much worse.
The result is that the majority of the words of regret is pronášena quietly and privately between war veterans.
When you have two sons retired Colonel Mark Cancian returning from combat operations, where he served as members of the marines, warned of their father on their service will be people outside the military look from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel the respect and awe, because we beat the hostile rebels and visited exotická jobs.
But others will be drilling head, whether it is “ under the surface hiding evil violent veteran, ” said Cancian, who was involved in the fighting in Iraq and to return to take his place in Washington in the government.
He argued that when looking for work, and some of the people who were with him doing interviews, quietly indicated whether so soon after returning to the fight will be able to withstand stress, which is linked to work in Washington.
“ When you talk about their service, you have to count on the negative reactions, ” lectured Cancian their sons.
Concern army partly stems from America 's indifference to the wars.
The successes on the battlefield rarely get the recognition in the country, which has its own army only small awareness and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are just a few of their own benefit.
“ As a nation we are already nevážíme military heroism as it used to be normal for the Second World War, ” said Lieutenant - General David Barno, who commanded the american troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focused mostly on the suffering of men in arms.
The soldiers are vyznamenáváni for the number of events, which přetrpěli, many friends, who have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing growing pressure to crack down on the use of rape
This week to determine whether it will be launched a judicial process 28 women and men against the army due to alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, they are prepared to file a lawsuit, hundreds of other applicants.
Vojínovi Class Elizabeth Lymanové was at night, when it was allegedly raped by a colleague from the army, 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she was flowing into the barracks on the air base of Miramar north of San Diego. after dinner with crony hits on her male colleague hand a box with 12 pivy.
He asked her whether it can add, that would make it to the room to a little popít.
“ In Title I came on warning light, ” described Lymanová.
But the native Texasan its objections completely ignored.
I thought: no, he is 19.
“ It is from Texas, ” she said.
“ I wish I listened to his instincts. ”
Claims that only a few minutes after went into her room, a man to come, threw her on the bed and rape.
This week, 18 November, will be Lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military 's wait for the verdict of the hearing, which could have a historic impact. this will take place in Arlington in Virginia and go in there about whether the allegations against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeldovi, gets up before the court.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is at odds with the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Charges have been filed in February, the Washington lawyer Susan Burkeovou and the plaintiffs had at the time, 17 members. over the coming months, however, their numbers have grown to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all claim that they have been raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army, and the army after the announcement of these útků failed in the investigation, and any punishment for the pursuit of justice.
Burkeová argues that it is for the neck of the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem begins just for them.
“ The army is direktivním system, ” he says.
“ Who are the people who are in a position to avoid an attempt to introduce measures against such things? high command. ”
Burkeová also says that since February in contact with at least 400 other survivors, many of which of them could become part of the other lawsuits lodged in the future.
Its strategy: rather than to seskupila all of the charges in this case - naskládala all eggs in one basket, as she says - will sue in more different cases, if necessary, to pressure nepolevil.
The team for the Department of Defense is leading the state representative of the United States Neil MacBride, who, along with her colleagues instruct them to reject the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek stated in detail, pick up a strategy of defence, in principle, that current or former soldiers cannot army to sue for injuries, which have suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the regulation of the Supreme Court from 1950 - called as the Feres Doctrine is the federal government responsible for injuries, which suffers soldiers in active service.
“ The alleged injuries related to the military services denouncing, ” writes in the document.
The Department of Defense has refused to comment on the matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women still officially allowed to serve in combat, it was just about quibbles: in modern warfare is difficult to find a clear the battle lines.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with the civilian women about certain acts in the war zone.
The result: between the wars there were 150 soldiers female - two - thirds of them directly in the fight.
Now is the time to have to modernise and in the army, explains Burkeová.
In their struggle is not alone in this case in hand on top of another three legal representatives.
The Yale law school preparing visitors veteránského seminars on legal services lawsuit against the four main military academy for suspected of developing the atmosphere promoting hatred towards women.
The non - profit organization vietnamese american veterans is collecting evidence for its claim of moving against the army. this complaint is focused on the diagnosis “ personality disorder ”, which was reportedly identified for victims of rape, that the army had an excuse for their release, according to activists, such as it is, for example, AMR Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women 's Action Network, it is a completely normal practice.
Her group has already in December to make a proposal suing the state organisation for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for help from people who said they were in the service of sexually attacked.
In Congress was presented by nine separate proposals, which presented a group of senators and members of both political parties and put them in a series of redress.
According to the office for prevention and resolution of sexual violence from the Department of Defense, in 2010 there 3 158 sexual assaults.
This type of attacks, however, remains in most cases neohlášen and, according to the Pentagon 's own estimates, this figure is equivalent to about 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year.
In a report issued in March, is dismantled the criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, the court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half compared to the civilian justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of a representative of Burkeové describe attacks just as the first of a series of traumas.
Private First Class Lymanová nahlásila, for example, the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, he says, has been asked to details about her rape reiterated 11 times the various members of the police, the doctors and the commanders.
Took all the necessary tests to determine the rape and in her bed was found blood - from wounds he has done on the arm.
About six months later, in April 2009, is a graduate of Lymanová before a court hearing, during which it has been raised questions about whether, on the day of the attack she loved with my friend.
It was předvoláno six people, which as witnesses on the reputation of vypovídaly in favour of the alleged perpetrators, who was eventually acquitted.
“ I remember the day when the judgment was handed down, ” says Lymanová.
“ I had the feeling, that right there on the ground porodím - with screaming I vyběhla from the courtroom. ”
“ We have put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I am my velícímu officer said: this was not his court. was mine. ”
Lymanové directing to attend military psychiatrist, which it eventually diagnostikoval breakdown of the figures, which it described as incompetent to service.
In January 2010, from the army without honour and, therefore, even without the right to výsluhu released.
Whatever the case Lymanové and other prosecutors will move on to the next phase, or not, we are there for the long haul, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of George Washington University.
But, notes, “ from my point of view, should be able to move on to the next stage of the examination. ”
Between them and the judgment, however, is the doctrine, which has come under fire from the first moment, what can see the light of day.
I am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their obligations neudávají adhere to the same level of a motivating incentives and deterrents to.
He adds: “ the chances are heavily against them … but it is important for them to try it. ”
Change to occur only when they are good people willing to fight.
If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, Burkevoá, lawyer denouncing, collected hundreds of other people ready to take legal action and will start work on other cases on the subject.
“ We will not stop with the army in this fight, where there will be reform, ” he says.
Or as long as neumřeme, according to what is to come sooner.
The walls have their eyes: scientists are exploring how you on Facebook
Than Anders Behring Breivik has become the new face of right - wing extremism in Europe, it was just another young man, that its anti - immigration views presented on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who has admitted to červencovému vraždícímu killing spree that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Despite Breivik could go it alone, in cyberspace is certainly not alone: during the attack spent a lot of time in front of a computer, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right - wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer with scientists want to know more about these people.
But as it is to find?
Easily - just to get out on Facebook.
“ We realised that we find them, are actually not that difficult, ” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of the recently published reports british research team, which was about the digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists were enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the site, and, thanks to this, with complete accuracy determine hledanou demographic group - something marketingoví workers are doing for years.
Bartlettův team across the whole of Europe find a half a million supporters of the right - wing groups, and then to focus attention and circulated them them ads. but instead, that is their through zvali into the newly established groups or offer any dietary products, is called to fill in a questionnaire, which occurred questions about their level of education, the relationship to violence and optimism, given their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlettovi and his colleagues have managed to get the results from more than 10,000 fans 14 different right - wing groups in 11 european countries - without ever having to leave office.
“ This is a completely new way of doing research, ” notes Bartlett.
Some of the results not so surprising: online supporters of the right - wing groups are mostly young men, which popuzuje rising levels of immigration.
But on the other hand, “ those who its online activism combined with off - line activism ” are more reasonable, more democratic, less violent than those who are constantly ukryti for screen computers. ”
The team 's work DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers are using these sites to learn everything from health problems after social trends hiding aktualizacemi Estates, contributions on walls and stisknutými tlačítky “ I like. ”
Facebook has reported more than 800 million active users. each of them a day on average will provide three different figures, from which the social network does literally “ information supernovu ”, which stands for the development of many of the new research, and the number of academic work, in whose name is found the word on Facebook, have risen relative to what it was five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists is the charm of Facebook in that it gives them the opportunity to study people without being had to bother somewhere in the middle of the street.
“ Before it was that if you wanted to carry out a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify. ”
“ You would have to get into a party, where would you but never lose, ” says Bartlett.
“ All of this Facebook eliminates - simply go directly to them. ”
Others argue that the site will be able to offer a way to identify the socio - health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study doktorky Megan Moreno from universities in Wisconsinu, the research team found that college students, who analysed its a drunken outcomes on Facebook, they were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who on this subject.
Morenová proposes that peers students website monitoring and came up with the supply of student aid, which publishes too many opileckých status.
“ The problem can be solved if it can diagnose, ” he told the Washington Post 's Dimitri Christakis, a co - author of doktorky Moreno and director of the Center for Health, behavior and development of children on the children' s Research Institute in Seattle.
“ We found a way to identify at - risk children, which would otherwise not have had the chance to discover. ”
Facebook itself constantly sonduje data of its users.
Information team sites by the statistics on the personal connection status and on St. Valentýna, voter turnout in 2010 and leverage the satisfaction of the nation (mainly using information that we should approach - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site has had its information made available to the treasure to research, as well as the other).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching, whether they like it or not — in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with crony, which is thousands of miles away, it is necessary to website to provide their personal information.
But what if the users of Facebook will become part of the research, which do not even know?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect the data offline. online data, however, are accessible to everyone.
“ I think the majority of users did not imagine that scientists could look into their profiles, ” says Neil Selwyn, a social scientist at the London Knowledge Lab XO laptops, a study in 2006, which was conducted with the use of public Facebook walls of their students.
“ If it was about them, take it so that the information is not just between them and their friends. ”
Consequently, it is also consider the methodology.
Even with research offline, there is no guarantee that the body is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible not to verify, of how much of the information is on the profile and contributions to the walls of the true.
“ What do you say to Facebook, and what do you do outside of Facebook, these are two completely different things, ” explains Selwyn.
That is why I Selwin, who spent long years of research on new technologies, thinks that the pencil and zápisník continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
“ When you go into the real world and talk with real people, this is something that cannot be replaced, ” he says.
“ Social research should be on the companies and social activities, and a lot of the heck social activities are still happening offline. ”
“ The cold and inhumane ”: Anders Behring Breivik participating in his first public court trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed to planning the two attacks, during which it was this summer in Norway killed 77 people, in his first public court hearing in Oslo described himself as a champion of the “ resistance ”.
“ I am a military commander in the norwegian resistance movement and between norskými templářskými knights, ” he said before the court, where 500 people gathered.
“ I object to the Court of Justice, because you have given the mandate of the organization promoting ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism. ”
“ Doznávám towards their actions, but nepřiznávám for them not to blame. ”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue cut off, because “ he did not want to give Breivikovi opportunity that this hearing, use as a platform from which could make their views. ”
For the same reason, refused to Breivikovi, which has brought with it a speech prepared to allow, at the end of the hearing to reach out to the relatives of their victims.
Nesheim also has ordered the police to hold Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him any contact with the media after a period of 4 týnů and announced that the final authorities will have for a period of eight weeks of full control over all its visitors and all korespondencí.
The hearing, attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and the survivors.
Some have lost in the hope that they would be able to Breivikovi look into his eyes, others to make sure that he is being held firmly locked.
We all took part in order to move the case to a speedy conclusion.
“ It seemed to me that seemed unemotionally and most inhuman way, ” said komentátorovi NRK one of the survivors of the attack.
“ It was not a pleasant, but for me, I can say that, then what I saw and uslyšel suspect, I mentally, meanwhile, moved on a bit further. ”
Breivik, in tmavém suit and blue tie, remained calm throughout the hearing and professional. when they arrive and retreat into the building without trouble in light of our journalists and the surviving in the eye.
Despite Breivikově bizarre notion that is part of a larger movement “ resistance ”, the judge naznal, that is crazy, and pointed out that there is no evidence that he had any accomplices.
For someone can be consolation that attacks on 22 June, seem to be the work of a single extremists and not of the radicals.
However, this does not automatically does not diminish the sadness and confusion, which are still in the minds and hearts of an entire nation.
“ I would like to see has been eliminated as stvůra, but this is not the case, ” said a relative of one of the victims.
“ If yes, everything would be much easier. ”
7 the lessons to be learned from the Lost interview with Stevem Jobsem in film mířícím into cinemas this week
When Steve jobs 5 October died, have started to appear the views of the people, who he compared with Henry Ford - and elect him as his biggest genialitu modern vynálezcem.
The recently znovuobjeveném Jobsově interview, which was oprášen special for the film, which is in cinemas this week, it will be for all the fans of Apple 's iTunes, the fact that his creative minds perfectly well understood business processes and work behind the flows of its products.
It was a fantastic designérem, dream maker and a member of the self - proclaimed hippie movement, but at the same time also pedantským organizer and man that every little detail fits in detail - believed that many entrepreneurs are suffering from “ the notion that really is a great idea of 90 per cent of their work … [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a very long way so many work. ”
In 1995 he worked Bob Cringely on tv, the agenda of the triumph of the computer 's, which was about the dawn of personal computers during the recording took place a unique, more than hour interview.
By then it was already had 10 years from now, what jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with their new computer company, Next and eagerly vyhlížel, as the general public will accept the Internet.
In tv, the agenda was eventually used a short part of the entire Cringelyho interview and on the original copies interview with tradovalo, that have been lost in transit.
Shortly after the Jobsově penalty, however, were found in režisérově VHS copies of the garage.
It is this material, slightly sestříhaný, forms the basis of 68minutového film Steve jobs lost: an interview, which is headed to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who was famous for her distaste for the provision of talks here longer, jobs are amazingly enthusiastically, that may be rozpovídat on its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it is also proving to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, between the question and the answer will come a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds thinking, when it is to see how the jobs answer perfectly considers to have it as the most accurate and accurate.
There are also moments when on the surface of sails Jobsův perfekcionismus when Cringelyho issues are eagerly and popohání him to quickly came to the more important problems and issues.
The interview was natočen before the era of Pixaru, an ipod or iPhonu and is frighteningly prescient example ideas, when jobs' s assessment of what others are doing well and the company 's badly, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to browse the posmrtná assessment Jobsovy careers, but on Jobsovi, which we see as dychtivého dreamer in the prime of his geniality, is something raw and inspiring.
Here is their own vision of how the matter could and should look like.
Before long, and then, what their ideas, it is also started putting into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is certainly worth noting:
How I learned to be guided by the company:
“ During the years of the business, I am always asked: “ why are you doing this? ” and the answer is always the same: well, that is how it simply doing. ”
No one knows why does what he does, never on matters relating to the business thinks in depth.
What I found.
Jobs goes on to say that describes its effort to simplify accounting in Apple 's iTunes.
It was absolutely confused by the way in which they have been recorded costs - often with the slogan “ standard ”, the cost of their $could only think. at the moment I decided to get their own way - developed automatic instrument, which guarantee, that could determine the cost of business in our heads.
How did rošťárnu on Pope:
Jobs remembers the “ blue boxes ” that sestrojil with Stevem Wozniakem - equipment, which people can effectively to hack into the phone companies and free of charge to hold the anywhere in the world.
The equipment that was written in the past for many, but Jobsovo enthusiasm, when the blue boxes describes as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
Tells how with Wozniakem facility tested using paid phone and during the conversation has left přepojovat from one network AT &amp;amp; T to another, while the use of what the greatest number of satellites.
“ We have not the least půltucetkrát propletli circles around the world, so when we then something zakřičeli into buying the phone, there are about a minute later a second phone call to the door, ” směje is jobs.
“ We were young and we found ourselves that we can build thing, which is able to manage infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world. ”
You two have been fabricated malinkou věcičku, which managed to control a much more giant - it was an incredible experience, and I think that without it, never emerged company Apple.
Jobs continues with a description of a joke, which with Wozniakem almost through by the end of the blue box. through the middle of the night to call the Vatican and asked about whether he would be able to speak with the Pope, and what is best for issuing Henry Kissinger.
Gradually drafted increasingly higher - ranking members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with the american diplomat, and only just before the phone to wake up and the Pope, the couple rozchechtala and handset asked.
As zamiloval in technology (and on the phone with Bill Hewlettem):
When he was 12 and sháněl spare parts, so that they could stand kmitoměr, found in the telephone number on the list of Bill Hewletta and called him.
Not long after their 20minutovém interview for jobs assured the summer brigádu in the company of Hewlett - Packard.
“ Incredibly influenced me. that was the only company that I am in the time I have known, and in my view on this, what kind of society is and how to treat their employees. ”
Jobs later became one of the employees of HP, who visited the corporate research labs in PALO ALTO, which saw the first “ desktop computer, that has ever been made. ”
It was great as the kufr, had the CRT Monitor and I look to him immediately zamiloval.
In my teens, I am in HP moved higher and higher, poflakoval I around the computer and started for him to write programs.
Both are inventing innovation:
In a few places jobs during the conversation is about how are inventing new products for a hand.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a couple of circuit boards, a customer asked for it has compiled together the entire computer.
Available should only pay 30 days, during which he had to invent, smontovat and add a ready - made equipment.
When he was later in Apple 's iTunes, remembers the problems they face in the development of computer mice:
“ I remember how we have quite a wildly squabbled … shouted at me, it would take five years [a mouse, which would cost $300], to me it has stopped talking, I came out and took the designéra. ”
About 90 days later we were able to produce perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies to be running out of steam:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple 's jobs, presciently predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision zakolísá and lose their share of the market.
“ Let 's say that you are working with the companies or IBM xerox, so do better kopírky or printers, so what next? ”
You have the monopoly on the market, so the company is no longer a company can be more successful.
In that moment, no longer dominates the sales and marketing, so companies šéfují people, who are in charge of this, while people who in charge of their own products are played off against from the decision - making process.
Technological genius, which brought the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad products - zručnost and technical expertise are necessary.
This is exactly what happened in society xerox …
The company xerox could own a literally the computer industry.
It could be ten times more than it is, could be Microsoft 1990s …
Instead of victory, however, has created a defeat.
As it takes innovation as a form of art:
“ Between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a long way to go and a lot of work … and how he is making a great idea, and is also changing and growing. ”
During that time, about a lot of it teach.
You have to agree to a series of compromises - certain things simply elektrony, glass, robots or factories do not force.
You have to bear in mind constantly 5 000 things - different concepts - and called them together …
At the end of the day, depending on taste - trying to think of the best things that ever what created the humanity, and, in a way, is trying to translate into what they are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I have never nestyděl for this, that I am the best ideas uloupil.
The company Macintosh was so great and successful, therefore, that the people who work in it, were excellent, artists, musicians, básnící zoologové, historians and, coincidentally, also the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for computers and new technologies, we can be wonderful things in a totally different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas večeřeli with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case to be addressed the court
On a day when the Supreme Court picked behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial, the question of whether to take the objection to President Obama 's health care law, two of the judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attending a gala dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be before the court is part of the negotiations.
The incident last Thursday, when all nine justices met to discuss the submitted proposals.
One of the cases were brought probíraných lawsuit filed by 26 states, questioning the radical overhaul of health care, Congress approved last year by - law, which mobilized the conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that the lawsuit heard in March, however, expects 5,5hodinové negotiations, with the result that is even more — unsettling presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at a time of a decision will be in full swing.
A lawyer, who will stand up in front of the Court and will try to achieve the rejection of the law, will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under the George W. Bush administration.
Clementova law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which is already a long summer deals with the advocacy of a conservative legal principles.
Another company, which sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations to question the law, called the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another was a sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which are in the process of stake in huge financial resources.
The dinner was held in Washington hotel a few hours after the debate on the subject of the case.
He attended her, among others, also Mitch McConnell, the republican leader in the Senate, and confirmed the opponents of the law on health care.
And the marketing of guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges the actions of the Federalist Society in for years.
And certainly it is not for nothing that would be in contravention of the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the requirement to observe the behavior, which are subject to lower the federal judges.
If not, however, would certainly their behavior were under the principle of C4, who says that “ the judge can participate in events, which are related and other organisations, in order to raise funds, but the judges must not be speaker, the guest of honor, must not be given on the agenda of the action. ”
However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two legal firms účinkujícím in the case, and also the company with huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to zalarmoval activists calling for ethics in government.
“ This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of some judges that the Supreme Court has behaved according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges, ” said Bob Edgar, the president of the organization Common cause.
“ The judges eating meat and večeřeli on social benefici together with the legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss his case before the court. ”
Their presence, and helping to raise funds through this action undermines the feet of any claims of biased, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas against its critics have shown little understanding and tell them that they also have no problem combine their legal obligations with action groups, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomasova wife, Ginni is highly senior conservative campaigner.
Moreover, conservatives have argued that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kaganová not with Thomas and Scalia.
Kaganová worked as the prosecutor for the government of President Obama, when he first appeared before a court challenge to the law.
Critics kaganové on it is pushing to have renounced participation in the case, and argue that the time for the law has struggled so much, than that may now be disinterested.
Kaganová not signalled that it was preparing to step down.
The company has received a record contract to Boeing jet at a cost of $18 billion
Emirates airlines order for 50 Boeing 777 dvouuličkových jet aircraft, with the possibility of buying 20 others.
The company also sells six Boeing planes Boeing Dreamliner aerolinkám Aman Air, which will collect more than $1 billion.
When a company gets order for 50 pieces of its products, in most cases, this is no cause for celebration.
If, however, is the company 's aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the cost of these 50 aircraft record amounts to a total of $18 billion, this is something else.
An equally important news is that too, where the company Boeing contract won: the Middle East, an ever - expanding cash cow for future orders aircraft.
According to forecasts issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will be in the next 20 years need 2 520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
The company has announced its Boeing on the weekend of the biggest order in history, in terms of the dollar 's value for commercial aircraft - 50 dvouuličkových jet boeingů 777.
Sensational contract came from the Emirates airline based in Dubai.
The company Boeing on Exhibition 2011 Dubai Air Show, said that airlines are able to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, which would be the total value of contracts climbed to $26 billion.
On Monday, then the company Boeing has announced that the airlines oman Air ordered six machinery Boeing 787 - 8, also sometimes called as the Dreamliner, which boasts a significantly better fuel consumption and facilities for passengers.
The overall price of one of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“ This is an excellent report for the whole company, Boeing, ” said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
“ The quality of these specific customer is very high. ”
Many of the airline in the Middle East are among the nations těžícím oil.
This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the rise in fuel prices - majority that is harmful to the airlines, because it is about one of its biggest cost - is not as decisive, because the country itself on higher oil prices earns.
This is important, because for them it is just as likely as other airline that might revoking or postpone the dictates of the aircraft because of an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
“ They have such a natural protection, ” he says.
Contract from airline Emirates strengthens the position of leading companies Boeaing on the market with planes with wide - hull and brings in close company Airbus SAS, which I would like to try to disrupt the dominance of the Boeing with its transport model of the A350.
A victory for the Boeing comes four months after representatives of the Airbus announced that there will be a delay of the first flight of their largest plane A350, which is a direct competitor aircraft 777 - 300ER.
The relegation came about because that customers demand more utilitarian burden on aircraft and range, so I took the producers time to the machine to add greater force to the engine.
The price action of the Boeing what has increased by 1.5% to USD 67,94.
The mexican president 's sister was apparently michoacánských defeated in elections
Luisa Maria Calderonová claims that her antagonist, Faustovi Vallejonovi of the PRI, to help in the hunt for guvernérským seat with drug traffickers.
It seems that sister Felipe Calderona in violent state elections for governor in Michoacánu lost. on Monday, said that one of its opponents to win MDC drug traffickers.
The preliminary results of the designated leadership guvernérských elections in the western state Faustovi Vallejovi by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“ The intervention of the members of organized crime in the whole of the electoral process and, in particular, to yesterday 's during the elections, is alarming not only for the Michoacán, but for the whole of our country, ” said Luisa Maria Calderonová in an interview for Radio one day after Sunday' s elections.
“ Threatening our candidates, members of the group for the poll … zabavovali ballot boxes, putting road blocks … and to get people to vote on the orders of the PRI.
Party, the PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the presidency came.
However, plans to soon return to power, and the victory in elections in Michoacánu is an important step in this effort.
Party, the PRI hopes that also prevails in July in the presidential election.
It seems that Vallejo beat Calderonovou, which even the day before elections led, only very closely.
Calderonová, candidate for the Conservative Party, his brother 's National Action Party, or Mr Vallejona, refused to recognise as the winner.
The third placed candidate Silvano Aureolis, as a party of the left Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now has been dominated by office guvernérský. for rozhádanou and smůlou persecuted religious party far ahead of the presidential elections in 2012 on a very unhappy defeat.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results to be valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, state on behalf of any relationship with the drug traffickers and rejects calls to other candidates recognition of the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializujícími on cannabis, heroin and metamfetaminy.
This is a native state president Calderona and just in Michoacánu in December 2006, launched a military fight against the traffickers.
Violence, however, prevailed.

But whatever the results of the elections in Michoacánu look for the party, the PRI, hand victory to build new momentum.

Bank ADB urges Asia, helping to save the eurozone
Bank Asian Development Bank called on India and China, to be ready to help with the rescue of the euro area before its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could lead to an overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on growth economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB, based in Manila, said that two of the fastest growing economies in the world must do “ everything in its power ” to help for the quick recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned before that the states of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China] all the difficulties are watching “ too nevzrušeně ” and said that the asian financial assistance in combination with the european leadership and resources will help stave off the long - term collapse of the global economy.
“ We are all in this together. ”
“ So to fit anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis, ” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“ Asia is perhaps somewhat protected, but it certainly is not immune. ”
“ So if China and India can help, it would certainly should have done. ”
The association is already several months sorely tried a serious debt crisis.
In the last days of the borrowing costs of Italy rose dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy could pull back into recession, and began appearing calls, to the newly prosperous leading economies to come together and help the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all asian support will be channelled through the IMF, but pointed out that mutual aid - as is the purchase of bonds to fund the bailout of the European Union, the institutions for the european financial stability - asian partners of european countries to provide greater negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, India 's trade minister, said that “ India will do what it can, ” to help the eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and vyschnutím supply of foreign capital.
“ No one wants to the eurozone remains unstable and restless, ” he said.
“ We are facing a difficult task, and we must maintain a high level of growth. ”
“ It is not about the alternative, it is simply a fact, because how else can we find a job for tens of millions of our young men and women. ”
Others argue that emerging economies, like that of India, have nothing to help european economies, if they are forced to face our own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brownově University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain to aid for Europe 1.2 billion people in India, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
“ One could find that the Greeks can retire at 50 and leave to use on the beach, which would be unlikely to explain, ” said.
Lee Howell, Director - General of the World Economic Forum, a similarly questioned why they should be indian reserves used to keep well - paid employment of many of the greek people in a poorly managed and money - losing sectors, such as rail.
Mr Nag pointed out, that the eurozone crisis is “ dangerous a domino effect. ”
Prediction that banks in Asia will be between the years 2011 / 2012 to 7.5% economic growth, now faces “ downside risks ” because of the threats.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create a “ unpredictable ” spending plans, to be protected from the downturn and a flight of capital from their economies.
The warning from the Pentagon about the potential cuts in defence
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress not properly under Pot, when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget, they could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction of start - ups in the Pentagon and the continued across the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembling linkám.
The Pentagon will have to already spend a budget cut of about $450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears reduction for an additional $600 billion, if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire portfolio, ” Panetta wrote in a letter to the senátorům John McCain, of Arizona, and 's Lindsey Grahamové, South Carolina.
He said that Congress' s inability to reach a consensus on the budget and, by extension, the so - called attachment to 23% across - the - board decline and stop many new projects.
“ Because of this enormous reduction, used an unwise this way, it will not be possible to implement most of our construction projects or ship - you cannot buy only three - quarters of a building or boats. in addition, there may be a serious damage to other modernization efforts, ” Panetta wrote senátorům.
“ We will also be forced to retrieve it, many of our civilian employees, and because it has a reduction in place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly civilians to send on furlough, in order to be able to meet the requirements. ”
“ These changes may shake the faith of those who are in charge of our army and seriously damage its readiness. ”
At the end of the day, with the cuts affect and combat troops, said Panetta.
“ Although the accounts for the funding of possible war operations overseas this obstávka directly affected, the operation will be affected by serious changes in other budgets, ” warned Panetta.
“ There will be a cut in the contract personnel, which will result in delays domluvených contracts supporting the war effort of our people. ”
“ The cut will be the paid staff, all of which will come too late payments to suppliers and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support. ”
Both senators Panettovi ten days ago, erased and asked him about the details of the possible effects on the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defense.
“ The consequences of obstávky at the Ministry of Defense, could lead to a rapid deterioration in the point of view of the United States as the world 's military superpower. ”
“ We are strictly against this brutal measures, ” the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when Panettův published a letter.
“ This is not the conclusion that we have been able to live, and we certainly do not want to sign him under. ”
“ The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which should not be allowed to happen. ”
“ It remains to be seen whether Panettův letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress authorizing the budget and will amplify voices calling on the Pentagon 's omission from the list of seškrtaných areas.
Panetta was recently in talks about a possible cuts ever more open, although he switched to its high position in the Pentagon with years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so I knew that going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held by minutý week defense minister has indicated a brief description of what his department can wait - shell of the army, within which, however, will miss the core.
“ It will be like a ship without them. ”
“ It will be as a brigade without ammunition. ”
“ It will be like the air force without a well - trained pilots. ”
“ It will be like a paper tiger, as an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough - grown soldiers, who would be able to complete the mission, ” Panetta said at the start of a speech at the Pentagon.
“ It will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a potential enemy. ”
“ As a result, we will welcome the aggression … ”
In the annex supplied with McCain 's letter and Grahamové Panetta specifies how will be reducing resulted in “ significant operational risks: late response to the crisis, wars and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibility of operations and deployments around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in the future of combat operations. ”
In addition, Panetta added that some of the greatest defense projects would have to wait for the end, including those that are already being tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
On the list, for example, a project of the plane F35, the planned new bombardéru, ballistic submarines, a new generation of new littoral combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, which like the Army and Marine infantry replace humvee.
Halting the further development and testing the plane F35 over the next ten years, save $80 billion, but his supporters say that it is a necessary next step in the fine - tuning of the army, which is the need for countries to deal with the possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to identify a lie
A cursory glance at the recent headlines suggests how serious and pervasive are lying and cheating in day - to - day life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a busy with accusations of sexually harassing a few women - both sides claim, the latter lying.
Managers at the University of Penn state were accused of perjury when they tried to bury the records that penzionovaný football coach sexually attacked the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy caught, as are set off by the microphone says the US president Barracku Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie is able to destroy the entire careers and zacloumat stability in many countries.
New York Congressman Anthony Weiner and Internet exhibicionista from each made a fool, when published the information that was immediately refuted incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of abused the finances of its campaign to try to conceal their non - marital ratio.
And no one will never forget the media circus, which is down around Bill Clinton when he lied during a second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Everywhere is packed with stories about cheating in school and at the university.
There are cases where teachers themselves will give their students testové answers, just to make ourselves look good in their reports.
Mentoři, who would have had to learn the opposite, sending a message that it is acceptable to lie and fraud.
With the number of fraud are seeing?
Studies show that in a single day zalžete somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose that many of them are compassionate lies.
Another study showed that foreign people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in the life of zalhali three times.
Determining the lies, or “ detecting lies ”, is the necessary skills, which should adopt everyone, whether for work or personal reasons.
This is, however, no social game, which would be similar to, say, šarádě, when one vykřikne: “ have you ” detecting deception. is serious science sector workers with scientific data collected during the past six decades at prestigious universities in the course of the detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that the majority of the old myths about the lies have been refuted.
Liars, calmly look you in the eye.
This is not the case, that would be zadrhávali, koktali, blush or have twisted and turned.
But nevyvozujte from this, that it is difficult to see any liars and reveal.
Trained identifier lies can uncover the truth from větné building, small - scale facial expressions, the way the formation of issues and their timing.
I spent a few years gathering scientific evidence of a large - scale and emerging sector on detecting lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is modern skills, which is easy to learn, and in today 's complex world, you can get a very - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, holding pohovorů, negotiations or leadership.
Good liars can well read, as well as in other, left them remain ever vigilant, directed their emotions and intuitively know, as is the other side takes.
We know from research that extroverti lie more often than introverti that men making more “ sebestředné ” lies, while women say more lies “ aimed at other ” - majority in order to protect someone 's feelings - that ženatí people lying less often their partners than free people (, however, lies, which they say, mostly tend to be “ outrageous ”).
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty, when you are lying.
How will you know that someone is lying?
First pozorujte normal behavior entity.
This is called the “ initial observations. ”
It will be later findings compare with what.
Notice the possession of body entity, his smile, work with voice.
You know, if somebody routinely constantly poklepává feet to him unduly neobvinili from lies just so that the environment of the meeting starts poklepávat feet.
Then they try to identify manufacturing clusters of false verbal and neverbálního behavior.
Take that, however, just as the warning signals, not as proof of the lies.
People pronášející lie may have to move the upper half of the body, when trying to remember their fanciful tale can top shoe filmed by the door, nahnout to East, significantly change the possession of the body or to demonstrate “ relief at the end of the interview, ” - exaggerated úlevné oddechnutí and a change of location, when it is difficult confession behind them.
The people in charge of the interviews often spend a false signal that is interviewed in the end, just to see how it will look like a concession after its completion.
Vnímejte also body language.
The famous is the story of how the Scott Peterson once suffered a slip of the tongue and used the last time, when he argued that his wife murdered body is lively, which began a nationwide search for her body.
Klamající individuals can also express odměřeně: “ I had no sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky Ms … ” or the difficult issue of a repeat the same.
The most common verbal signs are only a very slim.
Anyone can use a lot of “ zmírňujícího language ” when it responds to the difficult question: “ oh … to tell you the truth … from what I know … to the best of my knowledge. ”
In such responses are too often know the facts and it is yet another wake - up call.
There is no magic, which could expose every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills, through which they can lie vyslídit.
Using these skills will have one more chance, that in his personal and professional buys some liars and fraudster.
The controversial plan to build oil pipeline will be redirected after it appeared the threat of a delay in the approval of the american government
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus against poštvala trade unions, but subsided greenies - company with the construction of the pipeline in charge has announced that it is willing to redirect the project in order to things back into the movement.

A new environmental assessment objednaný by the State Department would probably any decision to set aside up to 2013, the year after the elections in the next year, however, the authorities deny that it played a role in the decision of the policy.
Obama, in a written statement from last week described the decision as a request by the State Department and express their support.
1,700 - mile pipeline linking Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas it every day running through 700,000 barrels of oil.
This route will need protnout 6 states.
This project is absolutely hates environmentalists, but love him working the platoon, which estimated that is at work on the pipeline would appear 20,000 new jobs.
Legislators in Nebrasce but against this plan and considered the introduction of laws, which would have forced the company to avoid getting into the region 's Sand Hills and the Ogallala massively layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study about the environmental impact of that objednalo Ministry of Foreign Affairs, found that the project will have only a small negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry, said that the Inspector General of the Department is ordering a new review of the whole process, the original study, and has focused mainly on two questions.
One was whether najatý company TransCanada lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was in the 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, who was in the conflict of interest.
Then another, whether the firm, which was carried out by who is hired to the original study, was elected to the wrong, because it has ties to the company TransCanada.

Hostile climate set back economy
During the first year of the government, Mario Lopez Valdeze rose in Sinaloa unemployment and unreliability, fell foreign investment and with them and the economy
The year 2011 will go down in the history of economic Sinaloa. this is the first year the government Mario Lopez Valdeze, which calls itself a government change. this government has brought with it a great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, because of adverse weather conditions at the start of the year has been detected no growth and even led to a decline in the key indicators of economic development.
February 's low temperatures caused millions in losses in the areas of agriculture, limiting the ability of the growth of the state of the economy, is due to a reduction in economic activity to 3.6% on average in the first session of this year in the areas of agriculture, there has been a. to a historic slump on 31,16%, which has undermined the dynamism and other economic sectors.

“ We are witnessing a growing unemployment, which is linked to various factors. these include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market because of the reduction in resources as a result of the legislation, which was approved by Congress in connection with the fight against money - laundering. for people who are illegally authorize $, it is not easy to have earned it, invest them or to use something, ” pointed out.
Stop migration
Lopez Cervantes said that the rise in unemployment will also be involved demographic factor.
“ The number of people who go to work abroad, in the United States, has fallen, and one of the reasons for the tough entry and then also therefore that, even if these people beyond reach, it is hard for them to get jobs, remain people. and demanding work from our state, and so unemployment is rising, ” he said.
Unreliability
Analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is getting worse as well because of rising sea, which is prevalent in the area of employment conditions. according to the National Institute of Statistics and democracy 60,38% of employed people in the state is working without distract benefits management of social security.
With unemployment and unreliability to add other features of the labour market, such as low wages. in this administrative territory are the lowest salaries from across the country, as states registers of Mexico 's Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of labour and social planning.

“ The development of the economy in Sinaloa was during this year really tiny. we need to work hard to regain ground that we have in this year 's lost year. in 2012, we must redouble our efforts, lacked the harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the right and synchronized operation of this new governments hope that next year will be much better, ” he said.
The slowness of the economy
Loredo Lopez said that events like frosts at the start of the year to stop the state economy and reduce its development and growth.
“ A weak economic movement was caused by a series of events, among other things, frosts. one of the main consequence was the slowdown in the economy, which was not sufficiently quickly recovered, so that it could once again raise the dynamics, which would allow it to reach an acceptable level of movement processes, products and services and that is why we have found themselves at the end of the year, well below the expected forecasts, ” he said.
The re - defining mission
According to Teodora Salazar Uriarte, the president of the employers' confederation of Mexico 's Republic in Sinaloa, we need to force the state to a more dynamic productive activities.

The work, which is before us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting the vision of the future, which would be better managed by the government 's efforts.

He said that the current administration has shown progress in terms of leadership of public policy.
“ There are elements that make it possible to argue that the government is trying to be welcoming., I can say that it is there to see the work done and I believe that the government is aware of the fact that it is also a lot of work ahead of us, ” he said.
Sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana
Residents of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of penalties for possession of eight kil marijuana.
The Republic reported that the prosecutor 's office, a dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela. Sandoval was sentenced for the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.

It owes contributions on projects
Social projects, which are part of the programmes such as Hábitat, saving the public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk that they will not be discharged or that will have major delays because of the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of the urban social development, said that if so far set construction work forward, now there is a risk that the government will not be able to secure the supply, which require a fund of more than 11 million peso on three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million peso. State falls to 25% in that time. the means to work supplied only Federation and the city, therefore, it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of projects.
“ They have to ensure the nearly 12 million and although year is now coming to an end, we have not received anything at all, and despite the fact that already in July, we should get some, ” he said. “ to lose any more time, projects, we launched and is very successfully, but we lack the money. ”
He said that in the last year for the administration Jesúse Aguilara Padilla, the state did not meet the supply, and therefore at the start of the new term had to ask the city for a loan that could pay more than 7 million, which they have not given the civil service.
“ The same thing we become already in the previous six - year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to be able to participate in programs and proceed to this year have come to these programs, we had to get the money, which would cover what completed its state, ” explained.
In spite of the fact that there is a promise from representatives of the state on the transfer of these resources, he said, that was sent to the request Armandu Villarreal, secretary for administration and finance, to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
“ We should provide us with 12 million and although year draws to a close, we have so far they have not received the peso. ”
The Court of Justice approved the “ end of read across broadcasting ” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of the bells analogických digital is one of the most important changes, which the world has seen in recent years.
The state Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected a constitutional lawsuit by the Senate and the House against prezidenstkému decree, which wants to speed up the so - called “ extinguish analogických signals ” and implement it in 2015, instead of 2021. stated that there was needed eight votes, which it zneplatnily.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, thought that President Felipe Calderón exceeding her powers when he issued a decree, which set out the steps that will lead to a transition to a pozemskou digital television.
With this result was rejected by the plaintiffs submitted to the Senate, and this is why that was reached the qualified majority of the eight votes needed to court to be able to express to the constitutionality of or neústavnosti referred to the decree, which remains in force.
The ruling by a minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of a decree to declare unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues relating to the radio and television is the thing, which I think is the law reserved for the federal Commission on telecommunications (Cofetel). there has been a violation of the principles of hierarchical deference and exemptions in the law.
For the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario pardo, Margarita luna and itself Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument as the Senate, and the House of Deputies supported constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Secretary Sánchez Cordero adopted requirements and suspend the application of the decree, and all of the events described in it, leading to a transition to digitize.
A meeting of ministers also decided to reject the petition submitted by the parliamentary chamber without came into the debate on the proposal, which has been in charge also Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister has said, that is not the same as the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards of measures to prepare the public administration.
“ I do not think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority, ” and reminded that planning for public policies in strategic areas such as telecoms sector falls to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Compensation analogických digital signals is one of the biggest changes, which has seen the world over recent years. linked to better use radioelektrického spectrum, better quality signal and more channels.
Believes that delay the change would mean a delay the benefits of digital, which requires decisions in a matter of public interest. digitisation that has only technical dimension, but “ it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues ”.
As pointed out, these issues “ require the entire operation of the established system, in accordance with the state 's economic direction. includes a number of powers, that the Constitution gives into the hands of the government of the state ”.
Reminded that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital system, and it has done so through their governments, and despite the fact that have highly specialised technical authorities.
That said, it is not possible for the government that has issued a decree from that to a certain extent encroach on the area of the powers of Congress introduced into the administration 's compliance with the law by legislative power.

On Wednesday, will be named the new italian government
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti are meeting tomorrow with the italian president, that he unveiled a new government, which will face a crisis that keeps this country on the brink of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti are meeting tomorrow with the italian president, that he unveiled a new government, which will face a crisis that keeps this country over the cliff economic disaster and said that the risk of the euro area as a whole.
The Presidential Palace issued a report in which he announced that Monti, appointed in Sunday, on Wednesday will meet with President Napolitano Giorgiem, to him, has confirmed that can form a government.
It is expected that the present government made up mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government to take power.
Monti said, that the president will present the results of their talks, which led to political parties in an attempt to form a government.
“ I can confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase, ” said the former European Commissioner journalists.
Monti said explicitly that it will be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles are overcome.
“ The framework is now well vyznačený ”, he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, so in a much shorter period than is usual. meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, because of the amount of debt has soared to unsustainable levels.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough package of austerity measures, which require european leaders. the only way it can restore nabouranou credibility of Italy.
Monti 's on there is great pressure that has been quick. because of the volatility of the markets have crossed the rate on the 10 - year italian BTP bonds with a maturity of 7 per cent threshold level, when Greece and Ireland had to ask for a bail - out.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the italian employers organisations Confindustria, told journalists after meeting with Monti: “ we have said that this government is very encouraging. ”
We believe that this government is the last chance to Italy out of this urgent situation.
Monti 's chances of success are greatly multiplied thanks to support from the PDL, Silvio Berlusconi, a crisis that has forced on Saturday to resign.
“ We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti is destined to good results, ” said journalists Angelina Alfano, Secretary centre - right parties.
Support for the PDL, Italy 's largest party, is significant, because until now, many of its members opposed to the government with the technocratic majority, which draws up a Monti.
Parliament 's support
Monti 's new government must have the strong support of Parliament to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delays in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks to add to the pressure and warns that Monti 's failure could spell disaster.
Monti began Monday in negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, organizations, youth and women.
Round completed in Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed in Sunday 's president Napolitanem that allowed in response to the crisis very fast - track procedure.
After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi will resign, with interest rates for italian bonds returned to a critical threshold and responding by the uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will reap success.
To save Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion range in the euro, would be beyond the capabilities of current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti said his government should endure in power until the next election, scheduled for 2013, and despite the general forecasts, which argues that the politicians to give him the time just to conduct reforms, and then to declare early elections.
Monti has said that he would like to his cabinet to include the policy, but the big parties insist that this government must be formed only from experts, to get Italy off the hook, which put the country because of financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties to make an attempt to integrate into government and political figures.

We have also added to the previous experience of the spanish national team in the complicated vyřazovacích matches on the European and World šampionát.
Kostaričtí players have a very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. there is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in the FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign match from the spanish team has scored Íker goalkeeper Casillas, which last Saturday before England losing (0 - 1) in London took on the former by Andoni Zubizarreta to 126 international utkáními.
Casillas comes today against Costa Rica and win for Spain 's new record - 127 international match.

Casillas and Xavi were even last week officially reputation for UEFA, along with other spanish players who have scored a hundred matches. between them the Zubizarreta to 126 and central striker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.

The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 games in Spain 's Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
The national side with less than 30 matches is Roy Miller, with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of the exceeding even 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba — two in Costa Rica, Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder nelson even in his first match.
The best střelcem Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.

Kvinteto included the country into its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
“ The road to Costa Rica is a dream that is becoming a reality ”
In an exclusive interview for Viva, basista Jeff Ament of Pearl pits said that the group is ready to next Sunday to offer one of the best concerts at the national stadium.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but its own group assures us that for them to play in Costa Rica is the realisation of a dream.
This is what he said basista and founding member of Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively friendly with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located at jihoamerickém continent in the tour to celebrate 20 years of its existence, and on Sunday 20 will be on the unique station in Central America.
That day will come out from 19: 30 at the national stadium, along with andělskou group the X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a demonstration of a transcript of the interview, which you can find in the pages of La Nación on the Internet.
For your kostarické supporters is the realisation of a dream. Pearl pits will play in Costa Rica. do you realise, what are your fans?
The journey to Costa Rica is our dream, which is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America, we barely a second time and experience to date have been great.
I went to Costa Rica only once, on leave. this is a wonderful country, and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days.
So we have a great joy, that you can bring our music.
I ask, because this group of literally zbožňují, fans are in these days of preparation is very hard.
What do you say their nejskalnějším supporters?
Thank you, that you have stood with us so long for a number of years.
It took us almost 21 years before we get to Costa Rica. thank you, that you have been waiting for so long, and we regret that it took us for so long.
Some people talk about koncertu already as the greatest show of the year.
This raises in you more pressure?
Some of the biggest show, which we have for the last 21 years, came out in a few weeks.
We have some excellent Show in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get to a concert in Costa Rica.
In truth, the concert power forward.
Love this country, like serfujeme, like the jungle. for both the activities of Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
As you get to know of Costa Rica and its waves due to surfing?
We have a lot of friends netizens and I have a good friend who lived in Tamarindo. the waves are incredible.
My friends from travel to Costa Rica or in Nicaragua, or to Mexico, and those are the best places to surfing, and so we have to Costa Rica, we were told by people who love surfing.
If you look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many písněmi.
What have you planned on their presentation in Costa Rica?
Given that there are never play, there are no restrictions on what we could do.
We are going to try to demonstrate what the best show with a variety of skladbami. will try to play a couple of songs from each of the ALBA and imagine our fans good and varied repertoire.
You never neopakujete repertoire.
Why?
I think that this is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves other compositions, therefore it is difficult to choose what songs will play every night.
When we are in the repertoire, two of the three songs, which we played for a long time, we are concentrating on them and also made a surprise, because we remember that, why are we so liked and that we have on this may have forgotten.
So it is for us to show more interesting, and therefore I think that is interesting and for the people.
This tour celebrate 20 years the artistic career.
When you look back, it is hard to believe everything you could?
Yes, it certainly.
First of all, I think, that none of us could imagine, that we will be in one big rock group and that it will remain in more than 20 years. it sounds like a dream.
We are aware of how much we were given and it moves us, that we can continue to play together.
Do we have to be happy, and they like to make music.
We are lucky that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted.
We could not be better.
What you mean that you were an important part of the grunge žánru?
Always for us it was an honour that we can be part of this group, in which is represented by the same velikáni.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is hardly surprising, when there is a movement of a group of friends, very often it does not happen.
From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common, so that from one city suddenly came out five to 10 groups.
We are proud of that and we are proud to be part of the group that we can from Seattle.
Sometimes, with some even playing.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains, and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden on tours. we are fortunate that they are all our friends and is an honour, that we can be a part of this movement that began in Seattle.
It is also a very unusual for the group as you keep together, and even after those years are still the same members.
Yes, we have four together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) join us 13 years ago, which, in itself, is a much longer than is usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, that we have all been fortunate that we are still in this world and, secondly, a role played by the fact that they are constantly concerned about one another.
We are all close friends and, thanks to this, we managed to open the musical journey, which let everyone enough freedom to his own experimentation.
Each other, we believe, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think that it could be better.
Your relationship to the word celebration was not easy. however, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How are the balance?
How we rostli, has gradually been increasingly easier to find a balance.
We are trying to nejezdit too on the circuit, because it is very easy to fall into this trap crowds and the people who love our music.
When you consider that people have come because of the music, that you have to confront the music and what you give it, you must not get carried away with respect. that you famous, rock stars. that neither of us never really was interested not in.
As you remember another project Mother love bone?
I think that we were writing great songs, and at the beginning of this was something grand.
As a band we were three years and we never get any album until after umřel Andy (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it took so long., the most important thing is that it is now přátelíme with Bruce (Fairweather) and Gregem (Gilmore), who started in kapele with us; when we listen to a song or looking at the pictures, I remember how Andy was incredible, as I have with him nasmál. always a pleasure working with him, laughing, talking with a bang or a football and many others.
It was an incredible person and power is missing.
National band Las Robertas will be charged with that, in Costa Rica began the show.
It is true that know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you do it is chosen as předskokany?
Yes, the production has sent videos with several proposals and this group we liked the most, which is why we are wondering what Las Robertas offering face to face and must be very funny.
Why always on changing the words Yellow Ledbetter?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He singing and I think that adds up to the first of what it invades.
Who you like basistu influences?
A lot of people.
As the first spring to mind Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski …
There 's so much that I could throughout the evening talking about basistech, who I like.
How has managed to keep the pits Pearl grunge, although they are not in vogue?
I think that we all felt always slightly separation from the word grunge.
When we think of grunge, presenting the group, to which I have mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all the others that have emerged in the same period, and if it is, even now, this music in place, so it is something of a beautiful, because this is the music, which is worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney today play better muziku than ever before.
At the beginning of the should your music easily bleak nature and now is more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel that in the new album is a couple of songs, which are lighter - style, but also there are songs as the leading or Juste Breathe, which are considered very glum, although may be as positive.
In either of the two, when me is Ed, so I cried, and these are the songs of the deeply dark.
I think that when vyrůstáš and you have in the life of any trauma, ztratíš someone from the family or friends, these things start to influence your art and music, and these two songs for me, this is what they represent.
I also think that you can be a happy man, and yet we do pochmurnou muziku.

Occupiers who zabrali 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, the rest are populated -, we learnt all electric and partly water facilities, in addition, pomalovali walls and left after rubbish all kind, especially after the cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three homes there were huge parties, which lasted only two days and awakening the other tenants.
In addition to the buildings is Disco Balmes, 51, was also damaged.
Her her, Maria Pantinat, explained to the Europa Press, after that time, when the building was loaded, sales fell by 80%.
Her disco stresses that the occupiers buildings it did unfair competition, because they condensed into 3 for the euro, whereas on diskotéce is 10.
In addition, her entertainment company had to react to the actions of neighbors because of the noise, but problems nezpůsobovali visitors a disco, but people captured the house, and especially those who participated in here held parties, whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks has increased, according to rozčilených people around.
Her disco explained that the problems were so great that even have agreed with the owner of the buildings and for nine months of her pardoning rent.
City police also confirmed that during the past few weeks, received more complaints from neighbors on the situation.
The President of the urban People 's Party PP at a town hall, Alberto Díaz Fernández, last week called for “ the building was immediately evicted and put an end to this with the problems of civil coexistence, which suffers from neighbors, and with the destruction of the area. ”
President of people 's explained that, before the summer was zabráno only one floors, but in recent months, the occupiers got into all the pinnacle of buildings and almost all homes, and in one of them, it has even to rip - off.
In this respect, he added, that “ there must be an end to impunity and be consistent, if this is a match against civil liability, which occurred in the building. ”
Yesterday, the city police also House building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes, the police came to 35 buildings on the street Mont - ral after it přivolali neighbors, who have seen let into the building of four people.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or the mountains?
Architects have gathered on the occasion of vypsání management, which involves more than about the controversy
Urban tender for 16 gates again opens the debate about the role of the park Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid - 1980s, at the time the largest heyday of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the Authority vytiskla several pamfletů in support of the park Collserola.
Letáček defined the mountain as a great park Metropolitan Barcelona.
What is more, was accompanied by the comparison with newyorským by Central Park.
Then, in 1987, the CMB, Park to come back into the thinking of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. the Catalan capital is one of the few that do not focus on the axis of the north - south, but up (Montenegro) - down (Sea).
Qualifications Collseroly as natural park was moving in that direction.
References already was in Central Park, but with Yellowstone divočáky instead of Yogi Bear.
That was the position until September, when the city declared a mega competition consisting of 16 konkurzy on the same number of entry points into Collseroly.
Of course, the idea of recording taken rather Park.
Either that, or someone trying to locate a gateway to the field.
But there is only one question: Collserola, Park or the mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisation on the basis of reflection on the town, the issue becomes a central theme of all the Barcelona architects.
It is already the subject of just otřelé, as when two members of the old caste selected at the meeting in the lift shake hands.
And it is this feat has caused one of the rare matches between what they think three barcelonští architects and předstoupivší university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: selection process makes sense.
According to Roldána after načala question of the Gulf, “ should ” discussed on “ the side of the mountain ”, so the speech Ildefonse Cerda on green apples has run its course.
“ We must be based on the principle that the Barcelona nejrozlehlejším Park is a beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex, ” said architect, for whom the title of “ the gates into the Collserola ” in the “ lexikologickou trap ”: we must not be a “ as input into the park, but rather as a definition of the zones, where it is possible to act. ”
Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experience of the world urbanismu qualifies as an “ intellectual challenge ” skýtající “ some danger. ”
The dangers involved in “ uncertainty, which today is a project of public places ” after the experience of the 1980s, which should be in the area of the forum “ its Swan voice. ”
The first concern is the very definition of the border, where should build.
“ Something to define the means to do another step, ” that is, in principle, to move a step further.
“ We need to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current (referring to the general Metropolitan plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster ”.
If we focus on the issue in more detail, Modol believes that a slope údolní Collserola can be considered a “ park, ” but not part of the Barcelona, for reasons of purely topographical.
Modol also reminded that there is already a work by the Patronat de Collserola, which “ must not end up in the dustbin ”, although welcomes the fact that the city offers his grémiu, that the project will hit from the “ first time ”.
In addition, and they understand that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a kind of propustkou, which allows architects to engage in the debate, but “ doubt ” that it should be precisely this technical profile, which will be led by a multidisciplinary teams (“ this is all about the skills, ” adds), which is necessary to create: “ the architects should be the only tools. ”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, which has given the title of this game, it is difficult, because in the material for the selection process is missing a global vision Collserola: “ has been declared a 16 tenders, which deal with all the axis of the mountain - Sea, but there is no podélná study, which would have on the field looked and saw it as a whole. ”
It gives the impression that he at least, up to all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project one gates can turn to the concept and the definition of the architect of the neighbouring gates.
In his view, the city should ensure that the band was located immediately above ronda de Dalt should ensure in the length of a zone equipment, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens.
Casino excuse Jonási Larrazábalovi, which will be released
After 72 days of legal Envoy Cadino Red gave the mercy of the brother of the mayor of Monterrey, in the process, in which has been prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent in prison 72 days and now will be released after him legal Envoy casino Red granted a pardon before the second criminal trial in the district, which has discussed the case in which he was accused of blackmail, the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the assassination of a casino owner royale casina Red, Gil Sergio García, published a series of photographs and videos on which had Manuel Jonás after demand for economic quotas to City Hall in Monterrey has allowed the illegal operation in sázkovém house.
After a public accused state prosecutor has launched a criminal prosecution of the brother of the mayor of panistického. 2 September was arrested and jailed for 30 days.
Then after 4 hours spent in front of the agent public ministry figure 3 for property crimes he was taken to the prison 1, located in the Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
At this point the remaining 49 days after it was delivered by a second regulation to trap and agent of the public ministry refuted by the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was taken to the Criminal Court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmail owners casina Red amount of one - and - a - half million peso., however, has remained only a couple of hours in the prison with medium - heavy supervision, because he was threatened with death.
The leaders of permitting him during the process remain in urban row in San Nicolás de toss Garza.
25 October it was presented to the order to arrest, who gave the Secretary General of the second criminal trial, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation were collected enough evidence to prove guilt Jonásovu. between evidence include, for example, the amount of the 1.5 million peso representatives of the casino, in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed.
On Monday this week, the legal Envoy casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judges, José Luis Pecinovi and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of region. on the basis that he will be able to soon return to freedom.
During the legal negotiations with a representative of the public ministry allocated to this court, Ramiro Arias, ask Garcia Gomez, whether they were repaired the damage and who from associates, decided to grant a pardon. lawyer but made it clear that the name will remain confidential.
On the basis of the official file 197 / 2011 grants legal pardon Jonási Larrazábalovi. in the process, which was against it conducted, it will not be possible to file a complaint also no. it is not possible to seek compensation for the damage or death.
After the trial, with the legal representative of around 15: 50 court has ordered the immediate release of Larrazábala Bretóna.
Secretary General Court, Jorge Yanéz, came to the prison in the town of San Nicolás de toss Garza, to Jonásovi, announced that he was awarded the official pardon and his case was consigned to the archives.
He also announced that a judge has issued a decree on his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome unveiled details about the plane crash, in which the General Secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The secretariat for communications and transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, which killed the Secretary of the government 's Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, show that the helicopter did not directly on the terrain with full force, without the pilot had the chance to try a forced landing.
At a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transport, said that before the start of the aircraft pilot said that climate conditions allow for years.
“ The parts that are appearing, suggests that the unit came up several times to contact with the ground, wings, zapletla into the branches of trees 25 metres from where the unit has lost hulls. ”
Also reported that the unit was intended for the 19 people, therefore, meets all the requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that, on the basis of investigations carried out in terms of the impact on the country, have not been found no components.
“ In the search for, it was found that parts of the plane were located in a different place, so the plane crashed on the mainland as a whole.
“ The helicopter was designed for the 19 people, meets all the requirements for the transport of people.
Terrain is showing a slope, prone to 30 degrees.
Secretary assured that, at the moment, is the most important to get the results of the investigation as quickly as possible, but it could take several months or even a year.
Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director - general of the airport and ancillary services, said that once the presidential helicopter crashed the General Staff of the range cruise speed and the accident happened on soft ground ascending.
“ This information supports the hypothesis that, at the time of the accident was a normal přeletovou operation, ” he said.
At a press conference, the representative of the SCT Pérez Jácome enumerated six key points of the investigation:
The visual years:
In accordance with the standards of the airplane was years carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, this means that the crew must during a flight to see the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reporting in AICM put adequate conditions at the start, in line with the plane is moving in the direction of the border between Mexico and the State of DF we saw sections of the cloud of at low altitude.
The chosen route:
It is likely that, due to the cloud of the crew has sought to lower the area and greater visibility to the valley in Cuernavaca.
The location of the impact.
Souřadnice crashed and the last record a helicopter from the radar agree, it is likely that before the crash happened to a loss of control, or to destroy the trajectory of the flight.
The dispersal of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information, which we are currently available, allows us to predict that the impact has been to equal the trajectory and from the side.
Nákres scatter remnants of the aircraft suggests that, at the time of the impact on the mainland of helicopter was intact.
There is no record of a fire or explosion.
At the site of the accident were not recorded no evidence, which would testify that there was an explosion or fire.
The final results of the investigation show that there may have been a few contacts with the mainland.
During the off - road work had been found the remnants of the aircraft in altitude - 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is svažuje, the tendency is from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the pictures, which were likely to break up along the route.
Information provides elements, which seems to suggest that the helicopter could get into contact with the country in a few places.
After careful searching in the vicinity of the accident on the territory, which is larger than the establishment, have been found the remains of a helicopter, which reinforces belief that the crashed occurred in the state, where the helicopter was still intact.
Mexico 's Institute of health insurance began research gene, which causes obesity
The Institute of health insurance leads research in order to discover a gene responsible for obesity children and adolescents. research carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
Mexico 's Institute of health insurance (IMSS) announced that leads research in order to identify the gene for obesity among children and young. research entitled “ the genetics of obesity among children and adolescents ” to get the results of the overweight.
In the report, the leading research medical units in the biochemistry of specialist hospitals National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, he explained, that was set up a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, experts on nutrition and social workers.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the centre of the research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) National polytechnického Institute (IPN.)
To participate in the research can also the general public, or nemající authorisation. people can come into participating in sports centres IMSS in Valle de Mexico City, where it will be every soboru from 8 hours to conduct stress tests by young people.
To emphasise that the research began in the sports centre Cuauhtémoc (the mexican state) and from 8 October, this activity is also in the sports center Nezahualcóyolt (east of Mexico 's state).
As soon as they obtained data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the sports center Independencia (south of the Federal) and eventually in the sports centre Morelos (north of Federal Center).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the ingredients and the importance of genetics, in terms of the development of obesity, and traced in Mexico 's children and young people risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, which is celebrating its 14 November, reminded us that the aim is to collect data from three of thousands of children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent of the and under the supervision of the parents, for the use of specific questionnaire about nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask for physical activity, and the family 's track record hereditary disease in order to avoid risk factors, which could cause diseases such as diabetes or ledvinová inadequacy.
Sure, that every Saturday with all the participants are antropometrická measurement (weight, height, waist size), measured by the blood pressure, is determined by the level of glucose, cholesterol, inzulínu trigliceridů, and studying the genes (trying to identify genes that are involved in the creation of the child obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects concern over an alarming increase in health workers, the children 's weight.
“ Health exit polls carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there has been only for boys to the rise in obesity about 77% and for girls to 47%. a dramatic increase in also occurred in the case of overweight, ” said expert from IMSS.
He said that one of the reasons for seeking indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from the others of their genetic history.
Informed that the average Mexičan has a 65% indiánsko - american genetic predispositions, 30% of the European and 5% of African. this is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is routinely explains as failure to burn excess energy they consume (calories) and which carries in the form of fat.
Researcher explained that the direct benefit participants lies in the fact that they will receive the overall assessment of the state of the children, which will see whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of vrásek dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and předloktí indicates the likelihood that a person will suffer metabolickými problems and předcukrovkovými positions.
The information is confidential, doctors it in writing to parents and to explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must carry out to their children avoid disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main ingredients that are causing the overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary life involving the lack of daily physical activity a day vysedávání in front of the television and the use of vehicles instead of walking on a short distance away.
Overweight also causes great kalorický income, which is the greater consumption of slazených drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgry, etc.) high in fats and proteins, and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.
In the asphalt from UNAM there will be bumps
Rafael Herrero, a scientist from the department of chemical UNAM creates a modified asfalty with polymery and creating a mixture of drawing better functionality, independently on climatic conditions and temperature
If it is rightly fostering dláždění, it would need to be repaired almost 200,000 výmolů after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valle de Mexico City, to draw Rafael Nájera Herrero, a scientist from the chemical School (FQ) from UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt dláždění was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of výmolů, or even may be completely removed.
In its přednášce technological cause výmolů, made in the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership is modified asfalty with polymery, thereby should rise to mix with similar characteristics like asphalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resilience, and both at the low, so at high temperatures.
Herrero Nájera believes that this kind of modified asfaltů could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some towns in the north of the country improve. so the functionality and reduce the creation of výmolů.
He explained that the asphalt, the most difficult part of the oil, is a grouping of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with great molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and others with low molecular weight, which are called malteny. together add asphalt typical viskoelastický character.
Viskoelastický nature of asphalt lies in the fact that, for high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acting as a discharge, in 120 - degree has high viskozitu and in 50 degrees is almost in solid shape, while at low temperatures of asphalt has tended to lámat, he added.
This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but it changes during the day, according to weather conditions and temperature, draw expert in chemical engineering.
Scientist from the department of chemical observed that most streets in Ciudad de Mexico City is covered by flexible dlažbou, which is made up of six layers of materials, three of which are the latest mixed with asfaltem.
Between nejsvrchnějšími classes are asfaltová vložka, consisting of a small add zalitými in the asphalt and then stlačenými.
To emphasise that every block, which is made up of vložku is zalit asfaltem.
In transit cars or in the creation of the pressure it is possible to force in the ditch well spread.
If it were a modified asphalt, spread would be even better, believes the chemical engineer.
Add that to the asphalt vložku are the last class called the mantle, consisting of a fine stones, so the sand also zalitým in the asphalt.
Given that this class will come into contact with ráfky vehicles must be more mechanical power than asfaltová vložka and must ensure the friction of roadway.
Given the fact that, as a part of dláždění will be exposed to the great burden must have the mantle of sufficient width and must be careful not to material from which is zhotoven.
The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factor, which is important to bear in mind, especially water is having a major impact on functionality asfaltové vložky.
Once the terrain vlhký, water is spreading inside and it is difficult to get it out, it causes a softening of all classes dlažby and the emergence of výmolů.
He explained that during the creation of výmolů as the first film will eat away at pláště, and then there is damage to asfaltové vložky. to damage but does not occur in one moment, but this is a gradual process, which should stop at the first signs of through appropriate programmes maintenance.
As a member of a national system of scientists also explained that the burden of the vehicle is another important factor in creating výmolů, and therefore tloušťka each layer dlažby must comply with the burden of vehicles and must ensure that this burden on the cross. is the only way we can avoid many of výmolů.
Rafael Herrero pointed out that when it comes to the asphalt, yet we have a lot of work and research is at the beginning of a. is worth noting, for example, asfaltové emulze, which are in other countries are already available on the market and allow easily repaired bumps without having to use high temperatures.
What has been missing from the list of the Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that have contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna failed to win the crown Miss Colombia.
Valle and gets 14. the title of the first vícemiss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to deliver on the crown Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with that, that was on the podiu vítězek, won a silver crown and šerpu, on the basis of which has become the new first vícemiss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday 's final in Cartageně, in which she won and torch took Miss Atlántico, the département won the title of the first 14. vícemiss. Melina has joined the throngs of women of Valle del Cauca, which are on the verge of a victorious korunce, but at the end of the day have been called the first vícemiss. between them is Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Mrs Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question many are asking: what was missing?
The result is a big defeat favoritky, which in all the previous rounds have shown, that is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and the best face Joile de Volgue. these titles, for example, have reached Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently odnesly and the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury chose to name it only the first vícemiss, is the fact that convinced his answer to the question: “ which book you enjoyed the most and why? ” asked by MURILLO Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos.
On the issue of the candidate replied:
“ I read a lot of very. I believe in the role of literature, I believe that this is one form of zkulturňování. book, which I have the most influence in childhood, was “ the Little Prince ”, very profound book.
Currently reading “ crime and punishment ”. it is a book, which is part of a global literature, that we should all know. and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, russian author. this is a wonderful book entitled “ El ardor de la sangre. ”
The answer is not happy about the term “ culturize ” and, therefore, that she explained what the latter books marked.
After the formal ceremony Melina has said that it is in a calm and is pleased with the outcome: “ the world is a wise, what is going to happen, it will happen.
And you people, read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. ”
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the front - runner position.
Bogotský journalist suggested that this, that she has been since the beginning of the most popular, nejoslavovanější and one that I learnt all previous prices (gastronomická challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dresses and the Queen Mother), raising the envy of other uchazeček, vystresovalo queen, which then on the stage has failed.
This was evident in the first presentation plavek on the beach Hiltonu and during two parades before final crown.
Although on both zářila, was to know that it lacked the strength and vitality, which showed reprezentantky from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist programme “ at home ” on Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first vícemiss confirms the fact that List, which during the competition will get the most titles at the end of the day, with neodchází korunkou Queen ”.
In addition, Valle in recent days has held the rather nevlídný attitude to the media and that it will pay for.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince porotu on its interest in social work, which are the basis for national beauty contests.
As an aside, two days before the choice of the international jury member of Luca Doughty said that they are looking for a woman who will be aware of social needs of their country.
“ In the competition Miss Colombia beauty in itself is not enough, we need to see something more than just physical beauty. we need to focus on social conscience and it is important to list before entering the competition, to be involved in such projects, ” explained.
Also, there is speculation that the candidate Valle has lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibróze, which was on the abdomen materialising. but this is completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, which it has chosen Miss “ natural beauty ” for the healthiest body, a healthy diet and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing for the Queen, acknowledges that Melina had the best body, that there were better girls, “ but the problems with the fibrosis in the abdomen, which in my opinion is not too noticeable, her ubraly points until the last day. ”
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos from magazine Cromos believes that myself from Valle made a mistake when he took a couple of surgical procedures.
“ Surgical interventions are in order, but in the Valle they go wrong.
Her body has never been a strong side here and chose its toll. ”
Because of this award, which, for the first time, the National Assembly udělovalo beauty, after the parade in her was a cruel forecasts, which are realized. it was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melině allowed that it might eventually give the highest crown.
Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina today 's day started year of their softness, not as the Queen, but as a princess, from a position, which gives it the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the national competition.
However, will go down in history as one of the queens, which despite strhujícímu success in Cartageně is the highest korunce received.
Such has been the work of the Cali, which identified a corpse Alfonse Cana
An expert on the fingerprints of Cali went down in history as the man, who confirmed the death of the “ of Alfonso Cana. ”
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4 last year, an expert on the fingerprints of honor in Cali entered into history as the man who has confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: “ Alfonse Cana ”, and by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who are working for the department 's honor, was this week on a number of Eliazar González, the men from the Puerta Tejada, 21 years working in the field of research.
At the beginning of his career González worked at a town hall in Chocó, where he has had often even more than five days web jungle, to get to the place where they were walking, that there was a need to identify.
In 2000, the přemístil into the capital of the Valle and after he graduated from the courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. this science deals with studying friction skin, so their hands the hands and feet.
In a week when it was carried out operations against the Alfonsi Canovi Eliazarovi, said that with the clothes at a minimum of three days.
It was expected to something big.
On Friday night, went on a tour of the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that will have to identify two bodies and that podezřívá, that one of them is the man who has led the world 's oldest guerillu. it therefore asked to have taken the card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leóna Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he came to the investigating team to a place where there was a mrtvola, have known it because of the physical appearance seemed quite differently. than in the media.
Did not have a beard, oblečený was as a villager in the area, without glasses, a much leaner.
But barely do not lie.
Along with galtonovou lupou, ink and transplantátorem and light Eliazar began to compare daktylové records the corpses of the minutes of the card.
It does not mislead the eye: it was a “ Alfonso Cano. ”
The same night man originally from Puerto Tejada was given to the Minister of Defense, Juanu Carlos Pinzónovi, confirmed that it was indeed a supreme commander of the Farc.
The search for clues
For daktyloskopa from Sijín de Cali, there is a recognition that Eliazarovi González showed President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference the operational services against “ Canovi very significant. ”
A lot of people don 't know our work.
Daktyloskopie is not an exact science, without the possibility of mistakes that can play a key role in the decision - making process of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses to help these people in research crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identities of people caught.
If they are caught, a lot of offenders presenting false papers or have Securities at all.
We take away the fingerprints and looking for it in a database.
Investigator told that in case of injury, had to be in the house to remove a piece of a wall of the house, because at this point, the thief relied for his trezor full of jewellery and money.
The walls are difficult, because they are not intended for fingerprints, but in this case we could get stamp on the eye, and to identify the perpetrators, who was involved in several krádežích ”, said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder.
Not long ago, found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation has found that could be responsible for the murder of one of the family members and the stamp on láhvi it really has confirmed.
Although it could not be 100%, to confirm that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on the fingerprints of the honor, explained that the objects with prints of “ blurred through chemical or physical reactive materials. ”
When there is, and has been for their collection uses transplantátor or the tape.
Stamps are then shipped to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or on registraturu.
“ The problem is that, as of today, there are still many Kolumbijců, whose data are not included, ” said expert from the honor.
He explained that not everything is so, as it turns out in television programme, CSI.
Like everything is třpytí, gold, is not at all what we make a reference, remain footprint.
However, if it can be used, must be carried out on the relevant comparison.
“ Indignation ” protesting in New York
Hundreds of manifestantů with tísnily at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted stanovat.
A large proportion of them waiting at the behest of the dismantling of the area and moved into the Middle Park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York Representative instigated by Tuesday, when the court order sought to re - emerge in Manhattan, where they were taken in the morning after. tried to pull another New York Park.
Hundreds of manifestantů with tísnily at Zuccotti Square, where we wanted to get through the Order, which allows the “ indignant ” to return to stanovat místi. the second part of the movement has responded to the dismantling of the fact that worked Park in the north of the city, where there have been further arrests.
“ If the court not to allow us to return to the square, usadíme at another location and will continue in the legal battle to get back into Zuccotti, both through the Assembly and peaceful demonstration, ” said one of the speakers movement “ obsaďme Wall Street, ” Mark Bray.
Bray specifies that the answer “ heartbreaking ” to evict the camp, which has ordered himself the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court, where a judge Luca Billings issued the order, which banned the eviction of location and allow manifestantům, to continue to stanovali.
In addition, the “ outrage ” zabrali and other park located at the crossroads of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, in the vicinity of the entry into the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and the plot fary at Trinity Church.

Japan after the devastating earthquake comes back to life
GDP is growing about 1.5% thanks to the household consumption and the end of a period of crashes, which began in March
Since March last year, Japan 's economy was paralysed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake, which had turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster, which has had to face since the Second World War.
The first estimates tokyjské governments have quantified material loss of 300 000 million dollars, blow, which, despite the difficult global situation well healing.
After three quarters of the value of GDP between July and September, got into such a position, that it was possible to finally turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and a 6% a year.
The results of the second quarter - to Japanese tax year starting in March 2012, moreover, assume the greatest growth rate in comparison with the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by purchasing machines, which are necessary for the reconstruction of areas devastated the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the January - March. this is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real wake - up call in the japanese economy is based solely on momentum, which forces taking advantage of the crisis to emerge from it much strengthening, or to rebuild infrastructure. is about to take advantage of the lack of it, is to start from scratch.
Japan is awoke. in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan 's GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of Yen
Flows are svěřilo into the hands of the internal market, when Yen - Japan 's currency, has become one of the “ rescue values ” for investors, who are fleeing from the debt crisis in the euro zone and a disturbing forecasts the US. it is a privilege, but it is also a huge burden for export business.
The stronger currency are products more expensive abroad, which is a negative for the country, whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, the Toyota or Sony přičítaly their weak results in July when in September just rate Yen.
While the markets continue to obléhají peripheral EU countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda is being cautious.
“ We need to be careful about the risks that remain, as is the destruction of some overseas economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in Yen, ” said yesterday, the state secretary for economic policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for economic cooperation and Development (OECD) specify that the majority of member countries in September showed clear signs of an economic slowdown.
Indicator, which predicts the inflexibility of the world economy, showed that the economy of the major powers are slowing.
Down by four - tenths of a on 100,4 points compared to 100,8 in August.
The euro zone has even received below average, which is at a level of 100. have gone up to the level of 99,13 points.
Athens again spreading uncertainty
Papadimos says, that will be approved austerity measures, but conservatives not sign up no written commitment
With fast and risky peripheral guarantees and uncertainty, which once again prevailed, Greece is still more zaplétá into the maze, which leads to the output from the debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that “ consensus ” to a new transitional greek government is due to the demands of Brussels, rather than a genuine belief of the political forces, is starting to keep up.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days, which came during his appointment, will probably be short for the app, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures in no case will not support and reiterated his demand vypsání new elections to the anticipated date on February 19.
“ The main task of this government is to apply the decisions taken at the summit of October 26, ” said yesterday Papadimos during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate in tomorrow, with the vote of confidence in government.
The package with 24 programs that promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message is not Samaras nevyjasňuje doubts about his position: “ we are committed to aid the transitional government, but nothing of further, we have already committed ourselves. ”
Chairman of the Conservatives went in his speech about the EU and the IMF a bit far. these organisations have unlocked 8 billion, which Athens urgently need; at the same time, but said he would not support and will not sign any commitment on the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission has already incensed impact, which caused Papandreou games with the referendum, yesterday stressed that its demands are red: neodblokuje no help, if the new government and leaders of the main parties nepodepíšou “ written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible. ”
Spokesman for economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from the troika will resume “ very soon ” to Athens and will act with the new government about “ what needs to pay for part of the sixth ” 8 billion. but there is no definitive date.
The Greek přadlena is still short of what confused.

Spain has made “ significant position at a global level, when it comes to the micro - finance. ”
The Queen Sofia yesterday, recalled that the country in the past two decades has become the second donor planet when it comes to this tool for cooperation, the essence of which is, “ that this is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. it is a tool based on confidence in the man ”.

“ Spain will continue to work ” and expand the network of volunteers “ in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly, ” stressed the Queen Sofia, which is hoping that the initiative and the benefits of the summit, which will last until Thursday, “ provides for the creation of a better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women ”, who are these loans mainly intended.
“ We have already achieved a great deal ” and “ many challenges is still ahead of us. ”
The summit on the mikropůjčkách is supposed to be not only diskuzním forum, but also a platform, which will support the “ fundamental objective. ”
Her Majesty has explained that the aim is that, by the end of 2015 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and to 100 million families received above the poverty threshold under which currently live.
The concept of micro - loans to Spain and to other countries of the world then, “ what is this path has issued a pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus, ” said the Queen and added that it is “ an act of justice and needed recognition. ”

In this sense, said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with a period of balohobytu, because this cooperation is a “ permanent duty. ”
Jiménez believes that micro - loans pose a “ serious and the honesty of the policy, which is to eliminate poverty ”, and now more than ever before, the developed countries' governments must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and prevent them just solidarity has become victims of the cuts.

The CDU is proposing to elect the president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The issue of Europe 's future on the programme was not initially, but it became her up in the autumn, in particular, to be satisfying for party members, who see the policy of the government today to the Greeks and maybe tomorrow against the Italians for lax.
A proposal for the president of the European Commission, given the leadership has been accepted almost in unison.
Only nine of the number of 1001, delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes standing ovation from vstoje at the conclusion of the speech of Angela Merkel and, eventually, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro - european finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: “ the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe. ”
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “ the nine million jobs depend directly on the euro. ”
According to the Chancellor in Europe, “ the time has come to change. ”
This could give the changes in the Lisbon Treaty for control of the European Union over budgetary policies of member countries of the euro zone, but it could also result in the election of the president of the European Commission, on the basis of universal suffrage, “ in order to give Europe a face. ”
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which is clearly inspirátorem Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly a little unlikely that all 27 countries in this revolutionary move quickly agree: is opposed the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU thinks that the same position will also Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is vytýčen.
As well as delegates rejected by a large majority of the proposal to appreciate the weight of each country in the board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in a boost to the weight of Germany.
Driven by concern to reassure the climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. attempted to obtain Congress but talk of the “ small ” european states or the countries that are in trouble, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the proposal on Europe is paying one paragraph of the importance of the “ Franco - german friendship, ” Angela Merkel France failed to quote.
Only indirectly.
When reminded that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most pokořujících defeats against Napoleonic military.
What a fraud in sick?
After subsidies, triggering the UMP party and government offensive against labour neschopnostem.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux and visiting the office for the provision of social support, where prosloví speech on the subject of recurring since 2007 on the fight against fraud and redistribution of social solidarity.
As escorts for the offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but it is no less clear from the point of view of the right - wing of the presidential campaign, with most of the right - wing wants to concentrate on sick leave.
First, because of budgetary savings the government intends to impose on the staff of the private sector 's fourth day sick before they begin to take in support of the disease.
To be clear, without the consent of the enterprise, the employee who is ill, he lost four days of wages, so at least 15% of their monthly income.
The measures, which risks to cause a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos could bring about 280 million euros.
And also the measures, which would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic impact: to give public employees one day nehrazené sick (so far have no failure over three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the majority of the right launches also focused on the theme of fraud this time abuses tied with the labor neschopnostmi.
“ The controls will be much larger and more: if you get, you will come back, ” pointed out Xavier Bertrand in granting an interview station RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seemed somewhat disproportionate to the truth about nepravostech in job neschopnostech.
These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political pressures, which bear fruit.
The French are more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
The first stop on a couple of official figures.
According to nationale Caisse d 'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance companies) was in 2006 paid out more than 237 million euro the daily allowance.
According to the French Institute for Research and documentation in the health sector accounted for in 2008, the per diem with its 11.3 billion euros of 5% of spending on health care.
Of this amount, 46% concerned parent contributions and work - related accidents and 54% on working in default, i. e. 6.2 billion euros.
So the only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study of the Alma Consulting should the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which holds some variation: another anketa R. published in 2007 in the pages of the Jobs behemoths. com showed that 75% of those surveyed 40,000 french employees said they have no nevybralo day of disability.
Another study, this time by institutions sickness insurance, makes it clear that in R. 2010 37,8% of defaults was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 in three months and 11% took longer.
When compared with its european neighbours, french workers are more prone than elsewhere to work neschopnostem.
One long study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence of (for health reasons or not) in France has alternated between 10% and 11.8% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in job neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the relative to work on the black market.
When it comes to fraud, these are just a small - scale.
The strengthening of the legislation from R. 2002 ensured that there are systematic controls aimed at working the inability of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that when 1.5 million checks was 13.8% of 285,000 carried out because of the short - term neschopnostem “ unwarranted or too long ”, i. e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systemically - controlled the inability of more than 45 days, with napočítalo 11% of cases “ adapted or unjustified ” at 1.2 million checks, i. e. 132 000.
A total of 169 so 000 “ unjustified ” cases on several million workers who have been sick.
The figure, which is much less than the number of its work on the black market.
According to members of the UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent a 9 to 15 billion euro missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i. e. more than the total amount of the daily allowance and the infinitely more than fraud related to the aforementioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply the new rescue plan
Greece is going to need a new rescue programme, to renew its economy.
On Monday, 14 December said this speech before Parliament, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos and added that a hundred days given his government of unity will not be enough to meet this challenge.
“ To again stand on their own two feet of our economy, we need the support of our european partners and a new financial rescue plan, ” said the head of the government, when making on Wednesday its first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament.
Implementation of the decisions taken by the 27 October in the eurozone summit will be “ the main task ” of the new government, as in the game is the participation of our country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the public deficit countries will be from teďka by the end of the year, “ around 9% ” of gross domestic product after what was 10.6%% in 2010 and R. R. 15,7% in 2009.
The right - wing rejects new austerity measures
The right - wing leader Antonis Samaras said on Monday its support for the already - approved measures to try to escape from its debt crisis, but pointed out that his party is not binding on any additional austerity measures.
“ For any new measures hand nezvedneme ” Samaras, pointed out in a meeting with members of his party for the new democracy.
We have agreed on targets for reducing the deficit and debt, and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy, which would impede economic recovery.
Mr Ollimu Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and EU neodblokují necessary 8 billion euro loan without the written guarantees of all parties, which will support the anticipated measures, Antonis Samaras responded that his word is enough and that will not sign anything under external pressure.
There is a need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Commission experts
According to a report by the Royal canadian company is excluded from the death of the Canadians.
In the matter of palliative care Commission urgently needs to governments, institutions caring about health and doctors worked together with the aim of ensuring the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.
The canadian company 's idea of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accepts the opportunity to talk with the doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and accepts the decision in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the report 's extensive royal canadian companies, which have helped six experts working in different areas, among whom was ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends the government changed the criminal law to dovolovalo assisted suicide and euthanasia, seems to be if this choice as needed on a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of the experts cited the recent polled independent agencies Economist Intelligence Unit, which compares the quality of the death penalty in 40 countries on the planet.
While Canada is placed at the 10th spot, the study notes that “ medikalizace death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death. ”
Medikalizace yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the royal canadian companies.
And despite the wish to die at home, which has a majority of Canadians 68,6% of them die in hospital.
The average pay for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Québec, this figure is the highest with 86% of people dead in the hospital.
When it comes to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report, arrive at conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change.
According to experts, who also scrutinised all countries, where these approaches are legalised or are not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that this odkriminalizování causes any abuse in the app, i. e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides in person or nepříslušné nesouhlasící.
On the contrary, P. Jocelyn Downie, co - author of the report, confirmed yesterday when teleconferencing more than many cases these mistakes that in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“ Euthanasia is carried out, and in Canada, where it is clearly illegal. ”
“ Assisted suicide is being carried out and in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, ” explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to the investigation conducted by Angus Reid Forum in 2010 with 85% of Canadians have already have in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that will allow people to the end of her life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia does not mean that we are sending a message that the life of the elderly or disabled has a lower price.
When it comes to those who follow the assisted suicide, 41% of those polled people believe that the court should not be prosecuted.
In the matter of maintaining or interruption of the care of the patient 's situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also on the list of their recommendations are proposing, that was in criminal law, said that the resignation from the treatment, for which there is a legally sanctioned by the refusal is not a criminal.
The Commission experts also requires that by specialist physicians were educated obligation to respect the treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care Commission urgently needs to governments, institutions caring about health and doctors worked together with the aim of ensuring the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.
At the end of the day on the final paliativního or defuse already widely used in the canadian medical equipment, the Commission wants to be seen at a time when no longer serves to the reduction of physical pain, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Other experts reservations
Some experts on medical law already have expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report experts royal canadian companies.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, specialist in medical law, described as experts - signatories of the report as “ extreme ” among other things, therefore, that does not restrict the practice of euthanasia in sick in the final stage.
“ This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and that should be more than 18 years, could ask for it to be helped to commit suicide, ” says Pierre Deschamps, who yesterday résumé to study the report.
Ms. Deschamps also underscores that it looks as if the authors of the report, built the autonomy of the people above all other values that are shaping the social fabric of society.
Because “ in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions. ”
Specialistka medicínského rights Margaret Somerville also expressed “ strong objections to the report 's conclusions, which kvalifikovala ” as a manifesto for euthanasia. ”
Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal canadian companies, in particular, is skeptical about the dates of the report concerning the absence of failures in some countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i. e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.

Following its decision to suspend Syria 's membership in the Arab League is now pondering “ the mechanism of civilian protection ” and is planning to send in the country' s 500 human rights activists, journalists and military observers.
The french foreign minister Alain Juppé is also much in favour of the idea of sending observers to the United Nations to help protect the civilian people before the repression of the regime, which, he says, is “ paranoidně. ”
The new special meeting of the League has called for tomorrow in Rabat, to take a position on a plan to resolve the crisis, decided on 2 December, and in which it was expected, in particular the withdrawal of the armies of cities torn by divisions and the release of imprisoned manifestantů.

R. in 1989 and 1991 should leave the centre in Kiev founded the company that produces “ nano - - diamonds. ”
The economic difficulties of his company it should lead to contacted in R. 1995 help the iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Before its return to Russia should then work from 1996 to 2002, at iránském programme.
In its latest report, the IAEA is reminiscent of the “ clear data on how that development detonačního system by Iran ” was based “ on the work of foreign specialists, which not only knew well this method, but who, how about that one Member State Agency reported - worked during a substantial portion of their working careers on this technology in the military nuclear programme countries, where it comes from. ”
Anti - Muslim criminal acts and delinquencies have risen by 50%
According to statistics published by the FBI on Monday the number of criminal offences and crimes against Muslims has increased since 2009 R. R. in 2010 by nearly 50%, while at the same time as the other racial and religious violence fell only slightly or few have risen.
According to these figures the total number of violence committed against Muslims has grown from 107 in 2009 to 160 R. R. in 2010, i. e. a 49% increase compared to the procedure on 13% for violence against Catholics, a decline of 4% for offences against the Jews and the overall increase of 14% for protináboženských of crime and crime.
The total number of “ hate criminal acts ” very slightly stepped on 6,628 cases, of which 47,3%, according to the FBI motivated by racial differences and 20% of religious differences.
“ After declining in R. 2009 is upsetting to see these criminal acts and delinquencies rise again ”, highlighted by the Human rights First dealing with human rights, “ the rise in anti - Muslim violence is particularly significant, ” added the organization in a communiqué.
“ Human Rights First long stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate criminal offences must be considered a serious violation of the rights of man ”, he adds, one of the leaders of the organisation Paul Legendre.
“ The US government can and must do more to deal with these abuses, ” adds and estimates that this may be improving police reporting on the “ hate criminal acts. ”
“ Hate crimes ” in US federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
The rule of law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish the violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now and sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and resembles more Facebook
The website providing mikroblogovací service Twitter introduced on Monday, changes in the design, to allow its users to see the work of successors, somewhat připodobňuje its services to Facebook.
The new supply “ activity ” and “ name ” allows for better and directly to know other people that you are watching, or those whose answers (“ tweets ”) are following you.
This makes it possible to know whether to monitor the contributions, whether to register for new accounts, whether they are popular contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter has been tested “ in August on a small percentage of users ” before it was on Monday extended to the whole network, said the agency AFP spokesman said the company 's Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for his little instinktivním operation, with dates a bit incomprehensible (RT for repeated the spread of the contribution of someone else, followfriday pour recommander suivre de un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, with 'ouvre ainsi and un PR plus large avec un maniement plus comparable and celui des réseaux grand public facebook ET Google +.
Online users now in its “ tweets ” differently to assess the importance of this innovation.
“ This is unnecessary, takes a lot of places and there is too much that is similar to Facebook, ” wrote @ jemb123.
“ The function of activity will help me better monitoring certain elements of my Twitter ”, sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Place a golden rule a balanced budget in the constitution
A large coalition government of Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to place “ golden rules ” of fiscal policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade of Austria credit rating agencies (AAA).
It is the social - democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision at the conclusion of the consultation, ministers in a situation where the austrian public debt, with its 74,6% high above the criterion for a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht agreement, but far less than the debt of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
“ If it was the solvency of Austria reduced only by one degree from AAA to AA +, we would have had to pay the interest on each year on three billion euros more, ” argued vícekancléř and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger křěsťanský Democrat.
Austria and follow - up at the request of the euro area summit in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where heads of state and governments strongly asked that, by the end of 2012 R. was to reduce the public deficit and the balance of the public accounts enshrined in the Constitution or the law of the same values.
The instrument adopted by the austrian government is close to “ the german model ”, Germany was the first european country that such a “ rule ” has adopted.
By 2017, will have to the structural deficit fall every year about 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and starting in 2017 the structural deficit Federal law allowed each year more than 0.35% of GDP, while Land, as well as community, will have to run a balanced budget.
The aim is to get in a matter of years, 2020 / 21 public debt below 60% of the benchmark set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda is at risk of a new interventions in the foreign exchange markets
Japan 's Prime Minister Noda Yošihiko warned on Tuesday that japanese institutions would have to once again in the foreign exchange markets to intervene, if only to continue to strengthen.
“ We are striking, as we did the last time, if we find too much volatility ” in the exchange rate of the yen, explained the Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday only once again rose to historic levels, which 31 October, forced the japanese authorities to intervene.
That day, the Tokyo sold yen for dollars, to reduce the value of the japanese currency, which only recently broke the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But since then, regularly soar by purchases of investors, who see it as a “ safe haven ” in uncertain times, the global economic slowdown and Europe 's crisis caused by the debt.
The dollar on Tuesday again came under 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar 105 yen close to levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008 - 2009 had the dollar value of around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The flare - up in the japanese currency is detrimental to the island 's exports more costly, because the cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of the proceeds obtained by japanese firms from abroad, when it is translated into domestic currency.
“ Japan is recovering from zkáz ” caused by the March earthquake and tsunami, which devastated Tohoku region in the north - east of the country, highlighted the Y. Noda, who fears that this expensive yen nezabilo eggs are still in a fragile recovery.
A third of the world 's economic power restored in the third quarter growth (1.5% given předešlému quarter) and that for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of export growth and household consumption loaded with disaster.
But Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen nereflektovala “ national economy of Japan ”.
Japan 's Finance Minister Jun Azumi called Japan' s central bank (the fight), which launched Tuesday in a two - day meeting of its monetary policy and the Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But víceguvernér this institution Hirohide Yamaguči pointed out that the fight earlier adopted “ appropriate measures ” to suggest that any additional monetary weakening is expected on Wednesday.
In their last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for emissions securities increased by 5.000 billion yen ($47 billion euros) of their purchases of Treasury bills and rose to 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) ceiling sums, which pays for purchases of various securities to inundate with likviditami.
The eurozone:
Rates are rising, stock markets fail
The risk of contagion to the debt crisis still undermine european indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of governments in Greece and Italy and a better figure growth in France and Germany, the rate of the weaker countries are continuing in its growth.
European stock exchanges still worried about the stability of the euro area is now on Tuesday 15 November sinking into negative expectations.
In Paris in 10 hours index necessary 40 is losing 1.4% on 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% in London and 0.1%.
“ With the new tensions around the proceeds of loans to the euro area states, which are in trouble, will continue with the stock markets around the world are passing only part of the recent gains ”.
“ Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion, ” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The stock market in Tokyo, closing with a drop of 0.7%, which has suffered because of concerns about market participants about Europe 's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“ Japan, as well as the rest of the world has eyes intent on figuring out of Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor variations, as long as investors don 't have evidence that the situation has stabilised, ” estimated Mitsušige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
The re - launch of uncertainty about the future of the euro currency itself harms, which on Tuesday continues its decline.
The euro is at the lowest level since the last month and a half.
At 10 o 'clock is the european currency value 1,3570 dollar in decline of 0.4%.
According to brokers currency gave up after Chancellor Angela Merkel 's CDU party at its Congress adopted in Monday' s proposal that incorporate the opportunity to leave the eurozone for the countries that are in trouble, without therefore had to leave the European Union.
Italian and spanish rates far beyond the 6%
The interest rate on the loans in Italy and Spain are on very worrying.
This morning on Tuesday the proceeds from the sale of the italian 10 - year bonds reaching 6,85% and a return of the spanish 10 - year bonds is 6.2%.
This tension operating on interest rates of southern european countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce concerns by market participants.
The head of the future of the italian government, Mario Monti strongly urged the markets on the time to correct the situation in Italy at risk poisoning caused by the size of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken by the 27 October in the eurozone summit will be “ the main task ” of his government.
Spain is once again finds itself in a deliberate přímce markets, when the country held in Sunday 's election in the Chamber of Deputies.
The difference rates (“ spread ”) desetiletými bond between Germany and Spain reached a new historical peak.
In anticipation of the figures oznamujících eurozone growth
The latest figures say that France has recorded in the third quarter economic growth of 0.4% primarily due to the consumption of households, i. e. a little better than expected growth of 0.3%.
France 's National Institute for statistics and economic studies INSEE however, revised downwards figures for the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP rather than stagnation.
And in truth, it is the fourth quarter, which economists worry about most.
For its part, during the same period, the Germany registered growth of 0.5%.
The initial estimates for the euro area as a whole are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission is to draw attention to the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts they must win over dogma
If there is an issue that can grasp on the basis of a short - term balance sheets or under the emotion, then this is the energy policy.
Disponibilita and the price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and business competitiveness.
It is natural for a meeting in the election was an opportunity to think about such deposits and on the ground, which takes a power from nuclear energy.
The debate will be successful only if we explore all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must establish its position on the objective facts and rational data.
So far, it is on the planet 7 billion human beings, but demographics, causing odteďka by 2050 to duplicate the demand for electricity, if we do not want a large chunk of the world 's population to get rid of an important part of life.
At the same time, we will need to face a shortage of fossil sources, in order to be able to continue to produce electricity, and cannot be, forget the necessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the fight against climate change, which is something, which at the moment are disappearing from the environmental debate.
An accident involving in Fukushima have no influence on any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear power.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which are subordinate to their decisions need to find some other source of capable of replacing oneself or Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the latest generation of power stations.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote, at least some of the country 's continuing with the determination of their projects.
The United States after Fukushima decided to expand its fleet of one unit of a resumption of the construction of a power plant suspended after the accident at the plant Three pleasantly Iceland.
If the german model based on renewable energy sometimes presented as an example, the reality is at odds with this.
The choice of Berlin appear zdražením electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas importovaném especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions in the wake of the construction of the plants to natural gas and coal.
All of these unpleasant effects will be felt in a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be given to him pause.
European champion in the wind, of which accounts for 30% of its electricity, is also one of the world 's largest consumer of coal and gas because of the disturbances of the wind, which are the CO2 emissions and danish higher electricity prices by 65%, or 50%, than the european average.
On the contrary, thanks to the stable of our energy policy will pay our neighbours electricity bill by 40% higher than the payment of french households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry on the national territory, the french companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
It is for this reason that any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would give rise to a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make a beautiful illusory statements about re - industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of the french refuses to pay, as well as it does not fundamentally against this energy, as polls show.
Let us remember that our country 's energy policy to stand up to the sector to 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 follow - up job.
Strongly exporting sector for us on the international markets a large number of small and medium - sized specialized businesses that create jobs, which cannot be transferred abroad.
If France has decided to abandon the core, the sacrifice of a significant number of these small and medium - sized businesses and would come about 6 billion euros per year, which the country receives for exports of nuclear equipment and services.
That plant, the owner, was ordered by the nuclear reactor designed in such a way that worked 60 years, while it was planned by the decline of its producers?
In addressing the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic source for the production of energy, and that there is no diabolical.
The development of equipment - producing low co2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment using renewable energy sources by french industrial group AREVA testifies to achieve better complementarity sources of energy.
In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts rigorous and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new plants in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose vocation is recognised, have the idea of security in the blood.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accident.
The only in the Three Mile Island occurred in normal traffic conditions and left without human victims and the effects on the environment.
In Chernobyl drama created the concept of the reactor and unjustifiable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forgetting that the accident was the result of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lesson to be learned from this accident as well as it did in the two previous.
The fruit of the move and cooperation between the french and german authorities on nuclear safety, operators and designers is that type of EPR reactor is a concept that is able to withstand such phenomena.
While all of the candidates who want to build a nuclear power plant, it attached to stop its construction in Flamanville, it would be a wonderful gift nabídnutým competitors of the AREVA and company EDF and the release of the way for it to seize the lead in the nuclear development.
It is legitimate and necessary to find the best solutions to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible not to emotions, dogma and machinations have dominated the debate as key to the economic, social and financial situation in our country.
It is for the economy of the immigration burden or a chance?
In the area of immigration policy pursued for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles, an oversupply of the police, courts and subjected to administration policy numbers, the compatibility of this policy to the status of “ the country of human rights ”, which boasts of France.
Recently it was the administrative harassment, which have been the subject of foreign students, which has become an up - to - date, when Interior Minister (see newspaper Libération on 23 May) said that France “ does not need foreign talent, zedníky and servírky. ”
But so far, the only rarely rozebírána under the angle of the economy.
It has to be said, that in this area is fairly broad agreement between left and right.
The right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac by saying that “ 900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million workers immigrants ” and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990, said that France “ cannot take all the misery in the world ”.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion hordes polish plumbers on french territory shared on both the right and the left.
In both camps are immigrants to be seen as a burden for the economy and a french company.
The only difference is in the state of grace, who deign to immigrants.
In its programme is François Hollande is limited to banalities, though, given that the joint development will solve our “ migration problem. ”
This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem may be valid in the elections, economically but it is very expensive.
As this is reminiscent of the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional PhD: how Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 page.): between specialist, there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, employment and wages in countries that immigrants are taking.
Restrictions on immigration is paralyzed by the growth and employment.
Concerns about the impact caused by the migrants are based on the idea that these people may replace french workers, particularly those less - skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But the experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants, adding more than náhradníky for french workers by doing work in sectors with a shortage of staff.
Few skilled immigrants in sectors that nepřitahují french employees, and the most skilled in fast - moving sectors in which education is not enough supply of jobs.
The positive impact on wages
As well as the surgeon will have trouble with work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesteziologů, this supplement between the French and the migrants are causing that came the immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of french employees.
Giovanni Peri and reckons that growth of migratory movements of 1% to spark a long - term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And while it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of přinášená immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalizovaných immigrants among America 's conduits of Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been based immigrants).
Migrants are also in european countries net contributors to the social systems for an average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Organisation of work, for example, estimates that in Germany one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring for their whole lives to public budgets net contribution (revenue minus spending) of 150,000 Hiroshima euro.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the start of his mandate desire is for the lack of growth in “ with vyceněnými teeth. ”
The teeth to deter immigrants should have just the opposite effect.
Europe invented the democracy, there is some european democracy
Democracy is rare, and it 's very fragile goods.
The european continent would be on this should recall, after all, despite the fact that it in Athens over two thousand years invented, experienced during the 20th century. the tragedy of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also, Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some people to believe that, in order to democracy finally triumphs over their enemies, will be enough to make the choice and implement it in the most direct way.
He has, however, already from Napoleon, that it was on the ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is the sine qua non of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may become a “ tool of oppression ” as once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, the separation of power and control, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe, we are experiencing is the economic crisis, but it is just so, and since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting mistakes of the greek referendum yes - type will not be in this regard the value of double exposure: uncovering the need for a return of political power, but also a sense of disturbing revelations of his impossibility, his inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be promýšlena, so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the lines of the democratic race now relocated and that many of the fighters already nestřílejí in the right direction.
Nothing we can win, if we require a national referendums held by necessity, and in a disorderly way.
A blank exposed to the absolute monarchovi or leap to their feet tied into the void of the nationalist deep: what kind of choice for citizen!
No, we do not want to knife the guillotine, but a common, fully - fledged, peaceful and sustained performance of choice and democracy, this time at the european level.
Are the crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - or we already know, where a list of stop - because of the crisis in Europe.
This is, of course, the whole of Europe sklánějící prior to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which are suffering from its failure and its lack of solidarity.
In fact, it is the whole of Europe, which is on the international stage ponižována.
Zneklidňujeme is in the transfer of sovereignty to the Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with each of its nations.
Urgently needs to be returned to the management of the european project democratic sovereignty.
Because only Europeans together will be able to reduce the burden of their debt, get rid of the governments of the markets and investment to prepare for the future.
East of the crisis will assume the decision at a european level, which will not be able to be taken without the full democratic legitimacy, otherwise we would have brought us into disaster.
Then, what we have long fought against this proposal Socialists and Jacques Delors, all today, we strongly call for the european economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and a passionate such as citizens, would be a new folly and new impasse.
We must take on a new phase of the building.
To produce the Republic in France, it would need to “ be ” Republicans.
The revolution in the interests of this could be sufficient.
This lesson applies to continue.
We need to build a Europe, which will be more economically integrated.
It will be able to make only building Europe more politically democratic and a true european democratic sovereignty.
Become the Europeans to build Europe.
“ Bezkontaktní ” čipové card is spreading
In the optimistic mood will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris World showroom čipových cards.
2011 should, according to the cabinet Eurosmart end up increasing global sales of cards with mikroprocesorem (bank cards, phones with Sim card) about 11% to over 6 billion units.

Testing the banks paying mobilem
But this is only the first step to the payment of the device 's future: a cell phone.
Technology the Near Field Communication (NFC) necessary for the implementation of the transaction is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
“ Taken the delay. ”
“ But to their real expansion should be completed in the next year ”.
“ For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world at 80 to 120 million units, ” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmartu.
But the banks are already being prepared in advance.
The bank Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test carried out on the town of Caen, which lasts from June to December of next year.
The machines iphone approximately 200 clients and staff will be equipped with pouzdrem bezkontaktní authorising payments.
Bank BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.

Terrorist Front ranges from the Sahara after Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between al - Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and boko Haram sect.
Long - standing suspicion that there are volumes of the terrorist group al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and nigerskou cult boko Haram confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister alžírského Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria about from now on “ got the certainty ”.
“ The way in which both organizations operate, and reports of the intelligence services, show that between them, there is a very good cooperation, ” explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two frenchmen in Niger in January 2010, could help shed light on a springboard.
After being kidnapped by members of the AQMI from one restaurant in, Niamey, should we be Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, the next day killed at the same time as a couple of their captors during the operation, carried out by french special forces.
In sutinách after intervention should french and nigerian investigators find a few phones with chips of terrorists.
Terrorist axis
An analysis conducted by the call leads to a few people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the Radio France Internationale (RFI) especially interested in investigating two numbers: one leads to Nigérijci, which long resident in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, that is the cradle of boko Haram, and to the other person, which says that is close to AQMI and sect.
“ This is progress, but it is, without a doubt, the need to wait for a more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and boko Haram ”.
“ But it is possible. ”
“ We have known for years that the sect is pleased with external financial and intellectual support and that is increasingly more actively, ” is tempered by the statements of Nigeria 's Kunle Amuwo investigator.
In recent months has been the “ support ” more and more obvious in the development and speeches boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which include odteďka human victims or more and more complex explosive devices, the same way of implementation, such as equipment used by AQMI.
The international community on the head with Washington since then put pressure on Nigeria, to take into account the problems, which raised boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, long regarded as a community group of enlightened mystics little of interest.
The rapid success
Sect boko Haram R. was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around mosques, schools and fundamentalists Mohammed Yusufa. boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means “ western education is a sin ”, approves the establishment of an islamic emirate 's in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region has such a combination of rapid success.
The sect politizuje and requires strict adherence to islamic law šaria, while its supporters of starting the fight against 'central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and authorities.
R. in 2009, the supporters boko Haram become extremely active and multiplying its attacks on police stations.
The response of the government is, as usual, is still the same.
The army obklíčí city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment, a group of radicalized and leaving their whereabouts in the north.
On Christmas Day 2010 performed in the city of Jos assassination, in which killed 80 people, then another in the main city of ABUJA.
In June, it is again in ABUJA, where boko Haram attacked the police headquarters in its prvém suicide attack.
And in August will be local úřadovna UN first international targets.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on, are worried about all the security experts.
Now, when al - Qaeda Islamic Maghreb obklíčila Mali and iger and Somalis from the Al - Šabáb operate in Kenya, the boko Haram appears as a new danger for the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in a conversation with the president Goodluckem Jonathanem Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of alert and is “ ready to hand over all of the information. ”
The world according to the candidates for president
In matters related to China, Iran or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry is being overtaken by simplifying and neznalostech.
Can America weakened to manage the crisis the world through simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to the presidential candidates that voters might think.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other repetitive strident statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran or help Israel between coincide.
Mitt Romney, the best is that candidate in the race for the republican nomination, “ the Grand Old Party ”, has warned of a Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusations “ due to manipulate their currency ”, which is a subject in America inflamed migration of whole parts of its industry towards Asia.
The worse, if this must incorporate a launch of a trade war, he said.
Huntsman, the Obama administration 's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, is almost faltered in the position that “ uhlazuje emotions. ”
It required a tough, but a constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama 's).
But Huntsman, who is on the last places in the electoral calculations, remains neposlouchatelný.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised to military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
“ I will, if elected, uvězním Iran, ” said fanfarónsky.
“ If Obama is re - elected, will have a bomb. ”
Also promised to increase military aid to Israel, obviňujíc, that Obama has failed in their duties to the partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second best was umístivší candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
Recently called for a sharp position against China 's military threat, because Beijing “ trying to develop nuclear capability ” - illiterate obviously the fact that China' s own nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strikes against Iran, says it is ready to send american forces in Mexico 's fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against the terrorists forbidden Obama in R. 2009 is also recommended Cainem, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmannovou.
They are all far elsewhere, than was in the R. 2008 republican presidential candidate John McCain, heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the president say that Reagan had also simple ideas and still won the Cold War.
Recall that Obama himself was amateur and add water to their wine in the fight against terrorism.
Highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the abrupt departure of “ Boys ” from Iraq, his excuses on Libya and the him to be labeled a weak

Nord Stream, a new entry to the port of russian gas to Europe
Distance the Nord Stream pipeline napojující directly Eastern Europe to Russia and led by along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to begin to work.
Must add gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the russian gas giant, like this event to celebrate.
More than 500 guests, including 4 of the heads of state and government, the last Tuesday attended the inauguration of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, a new, which under the sea link directly to Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his dutch colleague Mark Rutte turn together ovládacím around valve on the entry of russian gas to western european network.
The new pipeline will start flowing every year to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of russian gas pipeline first about the length of 1 224 km linking the region of St. Petersburg with the Federal countries Mecklembursko - Pomořany.
The other pipelines, which must be completed by the end of 2012, will allow R. to supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, an amount that is equal to the entire french consumption.
And already is reminiscent of the possibility of a third to build the pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom is timely completion of this nature of the construction of a huge victory.
Against the project strongly protested Poland and the baltic countries.
Nord Stream, in fact, will enable us to deliver gas directly to Germany without it, that would have been held around the country a third state (Poland and Ukraine).
Together these two countries are losing a bit of power: the opportunity to press for Russia threats that he turn off access to western european markets, it becomes more difficult for them.
Most expressed it WARSAW, when did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream for “ new german - soviet pact ”, with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in its occupation of Poland in 1939. r.
It means to say that it is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe by supporting this russian project in it gained more sure of their purchases.
But it is for the price of a weakening of Europe 's energy, because the project has created a rift between Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia has managed to barely 5 years ago to promote his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western states with high consumption of gas, whose deposits are coming to an end.
“ This is part of our partnership with Russia, the new route, which unites us organically, ” François Fillon confirmed for the ceremonial opening of the pipeline and has demonstrated, at what point are large gas contracts things both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles leaders Gazprom 's present in large numbers in Lubminu, přívodním place of gas.
The construction of the pipeline is also an important technical achievement.
Sea of steel pipes is equipped with betonovým veneer, that would be protected from kotvami naval vessels.
Lies at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 metres.
In his building was needed to avoid a minefield fields originating from the time of the Second World War.
“ For the sake of the safety of them had to be almost 100 removed or destroyed, ” says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It must also build up measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal had associated as 242 eiffelovek, which at its full length is nowhere suspended or valves or broadcasters maintenance.
One control platform should be built in the vicinity of Sweden, but the project when it rejected, the swedes were just a few chtiví see Russia 's state - owned company, as has been permanently trapped in their coasts.
“ In the case of defects can reverse the passage of gas for less than 1 minute, ” clarifies Jens Müller.
In the case of netěsnosti gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered a few builders likely, after all, svary was designed in such a way as to leak created one for 100,000 years.
Check the pipeline from carrying out an underwater robot - led ships, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by facilities, which circulates inside.
This equipment doutníkového - shaped on average 1 meter is introduced into the vnitřku pipes and it has found itself pushed gas.
In goal after three days of the journey at a speed of 3 M / to provide accurate information on the potential of the distortions of metal parts.
Distance pipeline was designed with the intention of 50 years without being small, Lending.
Circulation of gas is simply ensure pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 Bar at the start and 100 bar in goal.
For the implementation of this project combined forces five companies.
Leadership remains Gazprom, which holds the proportion of 51%.
It is joined by a german company E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and french group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream tasked with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has headquarters in the town of Zoug in Switzerland, where the taxation of the extremely convenient.
Gazprom, the company has leased out for five years of the treaty, which can be restored, all of its capacity to transport gas.
“ Gazprom will have to make a profit from the overall capacity, whether it is the amount of real dopravovaného gas any, ” clarifies Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of a gas pipeline has been secured from 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For a group of GDF Suez and investment costs had risen to $240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will come back, because the risk of takes only Gazprom.

Sensors measured the temperature, pressure and other characteristics of the coming gas before it is přepraven into german gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday the terminal is taking every hour of one million cubic meters of russian gas.
To reach full capacity of the 3 million for an hour and in R. 2012 6 million.

Why is it such a high proportion of the unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% against disabled people looking for work.
Today it is opening up to the 15th week for employing disabled.
Despite voluntaristickou public policy, introduced in R. 2005, is the percentage of unemployed disabled two more times higher than average, i. e., 19% compared with 9% of the population.
It is a depressing?
“ No, underscoring the likewise Blanchet, director - general of the Association of Adapt, which organizes a week for employing disabled. ”
“ The advances made for 15 years are remarkable. ”
“ At the time, it was the percentage of unemployed twice, but three times. ”
“ However, it remains a lot to do. ”
It has to be said, that for the unemployed disabled people remain numerous obstacles before they came to work.
It is an older person: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average).
Are low - skilled: 80% have no baccalaureate and 2.3 million of university students is only 10 000 disabled.
And at the end of the day - long - term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria, which is particularly difficult to return to employment and that they are “ at the heart of the problem, ” according to the Christian Grapina, Director - General of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992, to help companies hire disabled workers.
So, when it comes to the objective brakes.
There remains neřečené, ways of thinking, that is certainly going, but too slowly.
The study, carried out by in April by IMS - Entreprendre pour la Cité found that dotazovaní managers have weak ” level of knowledge about disabled people ” with exorbitant ” idea about who to pojízdném chair and mental health or mental deficiencies. ”
The result is that private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from that, in order to achieve the objective of employing 6% disabled workers set out in law from 1987.
The last known figures, which come from R. 2008, give equal state of 2.6%.
“ Now we are moving around 3%, ” says Pierre Blanc, director - general of the organisation Agefiph charged with collecting fees from companies that fail to comply with the law.
The proof is in the number of ” fined ” businesses, as well as paid, which have fallen between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit businesses to 46,000 (and of the 606 at 480 million euros).
“ The law of R. 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc. ”
“ But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, particularly in large companies. ”
According to the Department of work only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 workers employed by disabled workers compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
