The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Do not worry about just bare slopes Krkonoše vlekařům.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
It is therefore, in the Giant Mountains still can get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have got a big turnout at our website.
Browse through supply record prices, but not afraid to order mandatory.
And if we call, so just ask if we think will be this year's Christmas in the snow or mud, " said the operator information portal Spindl. Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants to stay in the New Year's Eve in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your wishes, I would have it said the order did not hesitate.
Those Who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation is for him to take second place, he may still try to wait a couple of days.
Špindlerovští hoteliers still offered on New Year's Eve mostly a one - week stays.
I think they will try to indicate a moment, but then they go and they allow for a shorter period.
And then the room will be open quickly disappear, " he estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates still available as a travel agency vrchlabská Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Even so, half of the seats in our offer remains open.
Therefore, we have tailor a cheaper Christmas holidays at the last minute, " said the director Peter.
New Year's Eve in Giant vrchlabská travel agent may not offer too, but there are fewer vacancies.
Well I sold it the first fourteen days of February, the other winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in the winter stays adversely affects that is still in the Giant snow.
People wait, if you wish.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year without the snow on the mountains.
If during the week of the snowy slopes, vyprodají even Christmas, " says Schiefert.
On the contrary, slightly better than last year managed to occupy the hotel rooms of Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're on it about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we have the last couple of places.
The big concern is about the Polish holidays in January and is sold well in February, " said the director of the best hotel Karel Rada.
Of the Eighty percent of the New Year holidays and the hotel occupied by Omnia in the central parking lot in Janské spa.
On the contrary, Instead of Christmas remains in the latest half of a hotel beds available.
Pleasantly surprised us this year in January, which we have at this moment occupied by some of the 60 percent.
A little less is still February, but once the snow, stay interested in Giant certainly rise further, said hotel manager Erik Omnia Sporysch.
The more snow, However, presents krkonošští hoteliers still have the desire to go.
On Thursday, be cool, if any, should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, he has come to the warming, said George Jakubský of Hradec managed by the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
The US: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost funny, with Barack Obama, the president with a reputation as the smartest, repeated in the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered it nejhloupějšího.
When he finally vypotil his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that it copied over kopírák of Bush's Iraq three years ago.
Not only in the text itself uses the word several times turnover as in Iraq ", but did not hesitate even to use the name of Bush's declaration in January 2007 as the name of their own declaration: " the new way forward ".
Three years ago, However, he criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, beset by civil war as " irresponsible and disastrous consequences of their decision ".
The subsequent months have shown, however, that Bush's strategy based on the advice of field commanders was the only possible and veleúspěšnou so today in the intelligence about Iraq at all levels from talking.
Bush's reputation, but he left to his successor, a much more grateful starting point than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama in hopes that a miracle again.
The increase in military contingent asked him again a field commanders, in particular the top commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, which even despite subordinačním harshly criticized the practice hesitant shooter in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men, in order to break the situation for the better.
The president of the three months he hesitated, but nothing better, and so at least 10 thousand soldiers.
In fact, Europe was able to squeeze out the promise of a further 5 thousands, even though he initially counted at least 10.
Most problematic for Obama's strategy appears to be to his intention to begin the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan for 18 months and stop this process within three years. of the Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the increase in half - baked fruit gives the same procedure as in Iraq.
Despite the internecine wars of recent years is the Iraqi society relatively well organized, its leaders to honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite sign - the one shall not count and no agreements have not been honored.
Wrong, under these conditions, the Afghan security forces used as day to day depending on the Lord, as it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain just a Potemkin village, for which they will continue to fester patriarchal tribal relations.
The balance of interests of the various ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to clutter ratios, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Neither the establishment of a " akceschopného state ", which is a minimalist objective of the operation, it does not look too real.
The time of Obama's strategy strikes his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation has only worsened in Afghanistan and is now on the verge of explosion.
Believe in that sending soldiers into a war in order to " return home early ' cause there made a miracle, can only really romantic soul, the facts.
From a political point of view, is to set a date for withdrawal of troops by the Taliban, because it would be seen as an implicit declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans ' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing.
European politicians can not and do not want to explain to voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically to intervene in the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and intensified sanctions on the Iranians do not do, there will be before the United States, the question of whether to try to solve the problem of the use of military force.
Answer it will be just the time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only for Barack Obama, is the fact that the presidential election three years left, and so there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop.
Managers of Goldman Sachs now get cash rewards
Senior executives of U. S. banks Goldman Sachs get this year pay in cash.
She said that the company is responding to harsh criticism of its labor practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive cash instead of shares that will be sold first in five years.

The Minister is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus on Friday morning, take the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering staying in the government, as opposed to shape the state budget for next year, as it was in the middle of the approved by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is expected that the budget and maybe even staying in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget has also been criticized Klaus.
He said the excessive deficit, which further deepening the crisis of public finances.
The meeting said the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
About his next term of office wants to Janota deal on Monday with Prime Minister John Fischer.
Under the budget, which now gets the signature Klaus, the Czech Republic has run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But the House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left on movements of money and the money to raise salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the social Democrats proposed that secretly inflate the budget deficit.
Between, on the one side and the Government, and on the other hand, because of a sharp political dispute, which is beginning to raise a question mark over the next cabinet, which led to the formation of the spring have agreed in the Social Democrats and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as the House has adopted, essentially destroyed the a package of austerity measures that Fischer's government in the fall, and which has stopped in its state debt.
Klaus, a law on the state budget may or may not sign on today's breakfast to discussion with businessmen, politicians have said that for a long time, " a serious problem ", which is " unsustainable " of public finances.
Today, he said he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could bring only a strong government that would also be able to rely on broad consensus of political parties, said the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is awesome, and the government should consider further existence.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas told CTK that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats and the Greens, was clearly not working.
Prime Minister Fischer called in response to such words as " strong statements ".

Mandela to the novelty of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman
South Africans, claim that the new Hollywood movie Invictus: undefeated denounced by the world a lot about the country, about her struggle and victory, despite some criticism that the main role of American actors.
The story tells of the sport, racial proportions and Nelson Mandela.
The indefatigable warrior against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is the Oscar - winning U. S. actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he jednadevadesátiletý Mandela asked him whether he would be in Eastwood's film to externalize.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I told him: ' If you'll play, I will need to have access.
The actor, who won an award for his role in an environment of Eastwood's boxing drama million Dollar Baby, and for example, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from which eventually became a slave, and even the God of the divine Evan, but it is rare for someone who is still alive, and so important for many people like Mandela.
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
The freedom of the redundancies in 1990, and for four years, then became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

Freeman had been working for several years on how to Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role, so I approached it the most realistic, " said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world policies were in the same area, he tried to meet with him, to have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important was that he wanted Mandela to shake his hand.
I found that when you pressed my hand, I am taking your energy, transfers, and I felt that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon in the film played by Francois pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, which prevailed in the white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him, it was when they first met in his house.
I remember I rang the doorbell, he opened up to me and the first thing I François Pienaarovi in his life, he said, was: ' in the film look much more '.
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of actors in comparison with their real masters under the leadership of the director the Invictus: undefeated positive reviews, and speak as well as ambitions for an Oscar.

The secret of the glow over Norway: the Russians tested a missile
Over Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border, tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Start again but was unsuccessful and the missile known as type " Bulava ", which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Neither his repeated presence at the missile tests had to the success of the test flights at the appropriate effect.
Bulava most ever took off or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspaper was the " Bulava " writes as a " rocket, which can not fly. "
The rocket, which can not fly but shine
This in turn was the 13th experiment was conducted initially normally.
Until the end of the flight was again damaged technical apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, " Bulava " starting from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which was below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missiles, allows the firing from the ship, which is on the move, and at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by the unidentified flying object was actually broken " Bulava ".
Indeed, the Norwegians from the first moment he had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals this time prevents a claim that can not speak clearly a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket and an accident to hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down right in the first instance.
Although completely flawless or may not have been a test start, the leadership of the Department of Defense considers that only six out of thirteen.
Almost 50 percent success rate so filled with optimism and generals and still maintains that the " Bulava " would one day fly without problems and that even hypersonických can carry up to ten nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.

Management Nosovice Hyundai car with the unions agreed to cancel all of overtime.
It is because of the often nařizovaným overtime on Monday announced a union strike emergency.
Confirmed car Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek.
Management, however, wants to trade union leaders to agree even on a Saturday this year's shift.
We can not waver in our production schedule, that it is essential, therefore, was designed to be voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December, with the result that would have made the two shifts, he said.
Server Sedmička. cz wrote that the company employees who work the Saturday shift, offered a bonus of 400.
He will get people back to work Saturday, 28 November.
The company, according to Vanek decided to change the way to motivate employees in the proposed overtime.
Either you leave to pay extra for overtime or compensatory time off may choose 28th December, and thus about the day to extend the Christmas holidays, said Vaněk.

Czech discovery: a substance that takes on ' hardy ' HIV virus
A team of Czech and German researchers testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved compounds is that it takes to viruses that have acquired immunity against drugs.
This fact, in some cases outweigh the fact that the compound is a normal variant of " not so strongly as some already available medicines.
AIDS can not yet be cured.
However, patients can greatly extend the life of a combination of drugs that inhibit the reproduction of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Partial suppression of propagation of the virus has also resulted in the development of the so - called resistant viruses against which the drugs are ineffective.
The work of the experts from The three institutions of the Academy of Sciences, of the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance to the virus.
Have shown that a substance called metalokarborany work on a protein responsible for the reproduction of HIV.
Metalokarborany are compounds of boron, carbon and hydrogen, and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus than any other currently used drugs, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work, scientists have come with the new ' improved ' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their ties to the viral proteins.
Metalokarborany a unique three - dimensional structure: two mnohostěnné cage consisting of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked by a metal, in this case.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease cleavage caused by the HIV virus would not have been mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the scientific journal, the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is systematically.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti - HIV protease was tested in vitro and also against the resistant (resistant) variants derived from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of the metalokarboranů a normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as clinically used drugs, but does not lose its effect on drug - resistant variants against which are used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and as well as its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications of metalokarboranů is interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Řezáčová, head of the lab Structural Biology Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and Institute of molecular genetics, of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument for the budget. ODS began to Fischer, he resists
The head of the ODS Mirek Topolánek, approved the budget for next year as " awesome " and the government of Prime Minister John Fischer, should be considered in his continued existence.
Expression of the ODS called prime minister with strong statements.
He said that the time for analysis.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats and the Green Party was clearly not working.
The President, according to the the government must decide whether it intends to rely on in the House minority, which regards the fight against the growing deficits, and he wants to stay in office through the parliamentary left.
Access ODS and the social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is a fundamentally different, " he said.
The House on Wednesday adopted a budget for 2010, but with the leftist amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased the money for salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
Criticism of the government's proposals to address social democracy, while that by increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote, left the hall, to comply with the wishes of the government, so that the revised budget is less bad than a financial temporary solution.
Disappointment and frustration
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation even more.
He is convinced that, if Janota seriously threatened to leave the function in the case of the adoption of the amendments, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech television Janota ordered on Monday after the government of the Prime Minister.
He indicated that at the time when considering a further term of office.
The reason for this is the disappointment of the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer is willing to continue the fight for the budget deficit, not Necas said the government what to do nominanti Social Democrats, who pushed through changes in the budget.
Prime Minister should also clearly say that he would resign if the House approves further legislation increasing the deficit, such as those relating to health, pensions, or an amendment to the Staff of the law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated ODS guilty
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers haven't done anything wrong, stressed in a text message from the U. S..
He recalled that several ministries are in náměstkovských features people claiming to be the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He stressed that if the Fischer decides to abandon the principle of the fight with the amount of the deficit, " is perfectly logical and correct, relying on left - wing majority, which is currently in the House of Commons ".
Then, he says, but can not count on support from Democrats and civil tolerance.
I did not think about it, and when it is the current, so it will take, told reporters in the House Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was nominated by the government of the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon left for the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister withdrew ODS
Necas also stressed that the ODS would be on Wednesday in the House to vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister of the Civic Democrats explicitly requested that the adoption of the budget.
I do not feel like orphans, we are small children, responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget was the absence of the President of the parties in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my voice was missing.
Even When I was giving up the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months will be bolševizaci the House and destruction of all positive, he said.

All regions but eventually signed a long - term contract with Czech Railways.
All three governors of attacks against us and talk about the fact that we choose the raisins, while we brought the offer only what they wanted.
He says that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the price of Czech Railways, which were concluded last week.
So we have no choice but to defend myself.
It is a slander against the company Student Agency, he said.
It also said that the evidence from all regions failing their actions in line with European law.
Therefore, the initiative is preparing for the European Commission.
The complaint is considered to be a continuation of the the media show, which serves as its unpaid advertising company and his own people.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of your and my country and to do the same challenge as other captains.
I think that, on this occasion, clearly shows that it is Mr Jančura who in the regional rail transport handles public and used false and false arguments, he said.

He said that the campaign after Christmas and stay in it wants to continue after the new year.

Vaccination against will be free of charge and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal January rooted habits and break down.
To be the first for the family as well as free of charge, and optional.
But we do not reverberating voice, it would be compulsory vaccination more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against the peak.
Pharmaceutical Institute has set a maximum price of vaccines, which will pay for health insurance.
Experts have also have clear procedures for vaccination.
The new vaccination
The vaccine free of charge for children in August
From January may be free of charge vaccinated against the children, who were born last August and later.
The condition is that we still do not have even one dose of vaccine.
Who started the vaccinations last year or earlier, he must pay for himself and others.
The first dose of the vaccine must be made between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against a quarter of families.
Parents pay 1600 crowns per dose or more.
While the need for vaccination, the youngest children are four doses.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies to get on the vaccine dose of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
But on the treatment that children without vaccination needed.
Yet for all the vaccination of children was approximately 500 thousand a year.
Vaccination was introduced by the so - called Janotovým package.
It causes inflammation of The middle ear infections, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infections in our country per year die in hospitals under investigation to 28 children under 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic introduced a paid area of children against pneumococcal vaccination in about 40 countries.
The vaccination will be compulsory?
At the same time, but there are views that would in the future could be the vaccination mandatory.
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
It would be better to vaccination, he suggested, for example, the head of the civic association Rudolf Kalovský.
His association pneumococcal vaccine in the long run.
Experts at the international conference that our association took part, they were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It is not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to push through at least this.
I think that is the way that we need to start now, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, but the process of vaccination against pneumococcal want to change.
At the moment about not consider at all, said his spokesman.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctor
The President of the Professional practice paediatric doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognises that the voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all the children have been vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of booster " in situations where this vaccine is the high amount is quite understand the political decision that vaccination was started as a volunteer, " she says, of course, Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that their infants to be immunized against pneumococcal from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is a breakthrough even that it was the first area vaccination of children shall be borne by the health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should be spending money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy yourself substance
But with the practical concerns related to children's doctors regarding purchasing vaccines.
According to the original intention of the vaccine should buy insurance and doctors would receive just as they become available substance to other vaccinations.
Some members, however, feared that this would mean that insurance companies " to transfer the money from the health insurance.
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substance and wait for them to reimburse insurance companies.
According to estimates, the individual child physician practitioners to invest in vaccines 40 grand a month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.

It may be a Muslim?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and, in general, are spreading scare stories about alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and thought about the fact that Muslims can integrate them - and whether - to one of the continent's secular society.
Some of the readers, after reading this book became admirers the artist's final work, " why the French do not like headscarves " (2006) , this elegant and discussed a study on the contentious issues that divide and employ the country for a period of 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious scope.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now taking care of 5 to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen called " Islamic ".
He is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on the issues that are most worried about.
A Muslim Should enter into marriage in a mosque or a Hall (or both) ?
It should be taught by a young Muslim on the development and gay rights?
It may be a Muslim can marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Has the right to use areas of interest - based banking system, if it wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, which are to be discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than the political dramas, which employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well - known people, including the tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, who was born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate on how you can simultaneously be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have arguments for all their custom.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the actual idei French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen conducted interviews, tend to doměnce that is a counterpart Selafiho - supporters of Sunni Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia - this group is small, but also affects the European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But the adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It wonders how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who doggedly defended the general public) is really committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims have in matters of faith are likely to experience less than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromise with the secular republikánstvím.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found " tightening the screws values. "
It may be a Muslim? after reading this book, anyone can have a tendency to say " yes, but not now. "

The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the planet's environment.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, which affects animals and their survival as anywhere else.
The interests of olejářských, plynařských and fishing companies must be focused on new natural resources of water, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their wake.
In the book " on thin ice " Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icons of the North, the polar bear.
Familiar with a complicated history and practice of whaling describes a long tradition of polar explorers, who tried to seize the white bear.
The meeting with Admiral Nelson, who fought only with muskets Kolbe is actually a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears, who swam for the bodies of their mothers were being killed, they capture and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, he was suddenly in a circus tent 75 polar bears.
Even today, the enclosure at the zoo are typically a million times smaller than the area, which are available to adults in the wilderness. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that the hunters threaten the survival of the species.
Even if hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where the hunting from helicopters and Indians on skis, and all are armed with assault rifles executive, which they are their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water to the north of the two nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book " the ice " Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear responsibility of the dismal science in the Arctic and an interesting glimpse of how it can change the future.
Not at all, researchers reply.
Even the weather and do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.

The U. S. government contractor jailed Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned U. S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptop computers to the country, according to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The supplier who has not yet been identified, worked for the company Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers, together with the U. S. interest section in Havana sought access to the boarded, who was arrested on 5 December.
Certain charges has not been made public, but according to the Cuban law may be a Cuban citizen or a foreigner jailed for almost anything that is labeled " dangerous ".
All the so - called kontrarevolucionářské activities, which include mild protests and critical paper, raise the risk of imprisonment.
Anti - graffiti and speech are considered serious offenses.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by a popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchezová repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to be able to accept the prize, but it was denied permission.
The detention of American suppliers may be the result of the growing tensions between the communist Castro's brother, the ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was monitored as a " delaying tactic " in improving relations with the island.
As the first to report on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U. S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government has taken concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, the United States take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought - after commodity in a country where the average wage of state employees is $15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones in this year; these are used mostly for sending messages as 15 - minute phone call would cost more than a daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and some government přípojkách, such as universities.
The Cubans, who often want to log on, their names must notify the government.
Access to many of the Web site is prohibited.
The detention of American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U. S. citizens of the US in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbenová, press officer for the American interests section in Havana.
Mrs. Berbenová said that it can provide more information about the prison.
His arrest and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would in any other open society were legal - say, free cell phones - is a crime in Cuba, " said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U. S. program group for human rights, who recently published a report on the freedoms in Cuba, called " New Cuba, " as a reference to the same of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and compensation for the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would have been more political, and that the Cuban government often provoke a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries seek to extensive dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants rozkrývají conspiracy relating to the posting of men in Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday detected the alleged leader of a conspiracy, relating to the deployment of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the U. S. troops, and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of crimp terrorists who prowls the Internet and looks radicalized young men.
Investigators said they searched for the grey rebel personality, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after it first appeared, when one of these men, posted a comment, the terristické Internet videostránce YouTube.
Saifilláh took over the leadership of these men when they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the Pakistan zone of the indigenous tribes, which is home to Al Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But Pakistani intelligence officer, who submitted a report on the case, said on Saturday that it was unsuccessful in Al Qaeda and that the men were part of the CIA trying to infiltration into the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped off for a few days to the eastern district Sarghoda, far from the mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were seen as shock troops.
This is why they were dropped, said the official, who spoke on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not deterred and still trying to get approval to gain access to the camps of al Qaeda, when they were arrested by Pakistani power law.
The case of the five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned FBI - underlines the critical role in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, to determine who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U. S. Secret service attaches the highest priority on attempts at the location of the human resources to Al Qaeda.
The organisation of work as a guard, eliminating those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
American Al Qaeda recruits were subjected to special scrutiny, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because, given their access to potential U. S. targets, and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the Foundation, based in the U. S., said that the terrorist group will also have become more cautious in recent years, in order to allow the came up to them, because the U. S. intelligence agencies to obtain their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow the recruitment model, which has already been so much? " said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those, which is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, called climate ' action '
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday to demand stronger action on climate change negotiators from the convention center in the city of Bella.
The protesters have reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police said that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists put a small bombs near a group of government buildings in the centre of the city.
On the day when the minor incident occurred in the talks on climate change, sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city, carrying banners with the inscriptions, " this is not a planet B " (ie, secondary) and one in španěltštině that proclaimed " who says ' enough. ' "
Protest attended several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, said that she traveled to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and provide me information about the dismal state of the country, which contributes to the impact of climate change, which still occurs.
This is part of the reason why we decided to connect to this great march - walk through the world and to appeal to the world leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, it still can not be avoided.
Police prevented the protesters to converge on the centre of Bella and said that it had arrested 19 persons, primarily because they either deployed or masks or carry a pocket knife.
These activities are under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the spectators, who did not wish to be identified, because it is involved in climate change activists disguised as athletes and in black suits placed several pipe bombs near the main channel, which is located near several ministries.
The buildings, he said, zahajivali flares, but followed by " several large explosions. "
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the parade in the afternoon.
But the protest is likely to be entered into the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, the Chinese chief negotiator on climate change.
When he was asked whether he had a positive impact on the international negotiations, said the English " Actually, that is something that I was not aware of " (actually it's something you have to realize) .
Then he went in and said, " because the site is large, I can not hear what's going on outside.
Monitor whether the march of pain or helpful, depending on the prospects for each.
You can see the concentration of the general public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: " We can also say that this is a distortion of the hearing or the freedom of other people.
The date of the test revealed a persistent racial differences
Federal certificate from last week on the progress of the knowledge of mathematics, it was a welcome element of good news about the public school district of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country's high - performance systems, the certificate showed greater progress for pupils fourth and classes in the last two years than in the cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest issue of the National Center for progress in school are the persistent differences in the knowledge between African - Americans and white students and both the local and the site, as well as national.
The average result of white pupils of the fourth - class District of Columbia for the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500) , but their african american peers were nrůstu only three points from 209, to 212.
The difference in the knowledge actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress for African - Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant decline of one point of 245 to 245.
The average result for white students was not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not big enough.
The image in term of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black students in fourth class in 2003, when the first NAEP was made in the area, was 60 points scale (202) .
Although the result achieved in children from groups during this period, the difference is 58.
Some advocates of education in the district in the last week say that the results, celebrated secretary Michelle A. Rheeovou and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) for white students were stimulated to a greater extent where the results have been high.
That would be hinting that we have increased the amount of aid at the higher end of the scale, which is troubling and disturbing, " said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non - profit group that advocates equality vdělávání in the district.
Jump up and down for the diffusion of two or three points, " said a member of the committee, Kwame R. Brown (D - At Large who has a daughter in the fourth grade primary school in Eaton.
Often criticized the style of management of Mrs. Rheeové, Mrs Brown said that a report on the results of the test means secondary education in the town is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It is clear that we always want to see the pros and I respect that.
But what is frightening, that we did not pay almost no time and energy, which was the need to pay to be paid our secondary education.
Mrs. Rheeová said that the effort is a continuation of the district in search for better ways of addressing the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, are some of the teachers trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, the reading system, aimed at students in higher grades of primary schools and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading before in their school kariéřea significantly lag behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics curriculum and teaching math in sixth grade, emphasizing the game and real life experiences, which have been in the district under the former manager Clifford Janeyiho, can be attributed to progress NAEP, which was the subject of a report last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and to carry out the best interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, said Mrs. Rheeová.
Others said that the results of the NAEP clarify the question of whether Mrs Rheeová can continue in the overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary for the difference.
It's a dilemma Mrs Michell, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, where she is studying the results of the tests in urban areas.
The conventional approach is to focus resources and administrative reform at the school, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
This can bring the focus of political repercussions, which is directed against the relevant agenda.
But the complaint but also includes other city managers who is trying to keep the middle between white and black.
We must focus on building a system of large schools.
We must cement a relationship of our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be given an excellent public schooling.
Mr. Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element of the reduction in the difference between the results obtained is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to establish the validity of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days, you can push through the changes, said Mr Janey, who concluded an Association agreement with its teachers last school year, from 185 days, which is considered a " flag " to be for the search for a larger increase in the next year.
To make higher education a part of a better future
Tour bus pulled into the track with a loud.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got out, and for a moment on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green grass ..
Gracielini parents barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Yet Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered on the soil of the track.
Now she and other eighth grade students in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition was $a year, their position was more than discouraged potential visitors enthusiastic students.
Yes, that's it! " she said, which would like to study medicine, when a speaker has offered to enter into the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? " she said, when they revealed a low ratio of professors to students.
The college was one of the seven who visited on his three - day trip, and now they are fully occupied with the future message: the question is not whether you enter the house.
The question is where.
But this is a problem in supporting the large number of U. S. born children of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from their universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who will get a college education and enter into the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this " generation " of Spanish students from college - remarkable results indicate that many of their parents, mostly Mexicans and Central America, arrive in the United States without having completed high school.
Their story of success is important, the researchers say, because it underlines the point the way forward for the generation that has played a marginal role in the field of the labour force of the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they have a natural náklonpost to the school and congenital assertiveness and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and seek ways to replace the ignorance of the American education system.
But the school programmes also play a special role in helping millions of children and Graciela, who would like to have track - especially if these efforts continue over time.
If you take into account that children come from groups with low incomes, whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them in the system, free from any interference in each item that is resolved, says Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We have to think about it, that we provide these safety net for children of preschool age in all the ways that pročšly college.
The federal program that funded the trip graciela on rails, is a useful example.
Known as Gear up (připtravit) , provides more than 300 million dollars a year for the local school systems to start mural training programs, which begin for students from groups with little revenue for public schools and continue until such student has finished the high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the college, according to the U. S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil Ministry has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get the major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure during the two auctions, which took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of the oil industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, the decades of war and sanctions.

Two U. S. companies have reached agreements on the field, which was auctioned in June.
The participation of American oil giants in an open Iraq's oil industry, surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and the American companies that have here in the first place on the way Asians and Europeans, " said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about safety, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U. S. military is likely to discourage U. S. companies from more intensive business in Iraq, which has the third - largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
American companies have in some cases at a disadvantage, in particular, the Chinese and other government - controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. is the only U. S. companies, which have concluded an agreement with the Ministry.
Leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of oil, and to offer technical assistance in the past years, left empty - handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of the week.
The China National Petroleum Corp. was involved in the bids on more contracts than any other company and left with large stakes in two major contracts for the fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic, as well as technological power, said a spokesman for the Ministry of oil Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and to honor their commitments to Iraq.
The company, which have been selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the price of a barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for the strengthening of the current level in each field.
A top planner of al-Qaida may have been killed in Pakistan.
When the impact of U. S. missiles at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week was probably killed a top al Qaeda operations, as announced Friday by officials of the U. S. counter - terrorism department.
As confirmed, it could be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets landed in čtvrtrek on their car near the town of Miran Shah in the province of Sevverní Waziristan, according to U. S. sources and pakisttánských officials in the area.
Local authorities ounámily that the rockets were fired from an aeroplane type, which operates with the CIA in the illegal indigenous tribes.
They were directed to a white car, which was heading to the Afghan border, when he was hit, said an official with the Pakistani intelligence agency, who was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local militants are swept to the point quickly zabavilito what was left of " totally destroyed ".
Local authorities have not been able to verify the identity of the victims, but two U. S. officials cited an unspecified anti - terrorism department of the witness, who said that the Somali was death.
Somali has been cited as a senior Al Qaeda planner of military operations, who directed the operation of terrorist groups outside the area of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the zosnovávání throughout the world, said a senior official, who did not wish to be named, citing the sensitive nature of the U. S. air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he had a central position, was probably involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top management of Al Qaeda and on the basis of them planned for possible terrorist attacks.
Another American official said that Somali quickly progressed in the hierarchy of the Al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not need to be well known person for some Americans, but that in no way was that before us and our allies posed, said another officer.
When his death was confirmed, the Somali should be the second senior leader of Al Qaeda or the Taliban, who should be killed since September, when he was killed in a similar attack, the leader of the militant factions in the Gaza indigenous tribes and three other top leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has been reduced since the summer, from an average of around six operations per month to two, according to the Long War Journal, Web pages, managed by non - profit group.
The Reduction may be the reason for the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by the ruthless killing of persons who were suspected of being informers, said Page.
Top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul.
Top UN envoy to the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from his post in March and of his or her term, which was thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential elections in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
To The left, because the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional U. S. troops to Afghanistan.
UN delegate said that he supported an increase, but expressed concern that the timetable for the U. S. to reduce state, which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the government of the other NATO nations to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal Afgáncům that they have to have confidence in the international community, said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long - term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase of the armed forces must be copied to the civilians, he said.
Eide said he resigned, but that just fulfil the promise, that he gave his family in March 2008, in Kabul spends only two years.
He said that he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon is now said that he needed time for a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look after the dauphin, " said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two - month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to officials of the UN Ban began seeking compensation.
Officials said that will be decided between the Staffan di Mistura, who has a Swedish - Italian origin, and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean - Maria Guéhennem, Frenchman, who led the UN peacekeeping operations.
The situation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was charged in September, President Hamid Karzai, who won the presidential election on the cloak of the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide has denied those allegations, but said that the allegations Galgraitha - which was released - " definitely harm the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention " in the election.
Eide said that the proposed meeting with the chief representative of the citizens due to the coordination of relief efforts at keeping U. S. forces in Afghanistan.
Also at the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries, which would be for the Afghan mission, because, he says, he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is utilized properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan and said that the heavy - handed regulation to hire undermine the UN's ability to use.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get in May, only one person, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can not continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose on Iran " significant additional penalties " because of a lack of involvement in the talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq during a week - long trip to areas where there is conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to an inquiry by a soldier on the of the likely evolution.
One of the things that depend on me, is that if I learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is an inherent unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration decided on a package of sanctions that could affect the iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the ordinary Iranians.
He said that " the package of incentives and barriers " would require " to persuade the iranian government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons, " because " the people will suffer from sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion, issued by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leader in warning that Iran will be serious consequences if its nuclear program fails to comply fully with the UN nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop their expertise for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wants to return to talks on reducing their nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of its stocks of enriched uranium in return for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has planted in such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran withdraws from the interim agreements - in part because, says the expert, because leadership is irámské is divided about whether to commit the United States.
Frankly, if the Iranian obstinacy to the international community for some suggestions, which are actually agreed in early October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on the way that is not on the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set for 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other options, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called " sanctions ".
In its opinion, issued in New York, iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what he called " unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations " against some members of the Security Committee of the Iranian nuclear activities and said that he wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers " to achieve an adequate long - term solutions.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, he met this morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before he flew to the area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuku and Kurdish leaders in Irbilu.
There remains a high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, in particular because of the border, property rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to zabránlo delay U. S. plans to reduce the U. S. the number of American troops from 115000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dampen concerns about Kurdish persistent depression. Official U. S. site quoted Gates, he told the US Massoudu Barzáanímu, President kurdistánské regional governments: " We want to protect your security, prosperity, and within a united Iraq.
We do not want to leave you. "
In an ageing China, change course
Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which read that " Mother Earth is too tired to fund more children " and " one child, " also means a grave also.
Then they got a lesson that when the official government in Shanghai, low birth rate and ageing of the population in their city, suddenly changed course in the summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: never.
We have always spent all their time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31 years old, manager of human resources, which has 8měsíčního son.
More than 30 years of China's policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations only the notoriously boubelatých and zhýčkaných children, " little emperors ", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average fertility rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before vpolitika vsoupila force, according to UN figures.
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years and above, predicts that the population 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. that's far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, such as for example, in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and above were almost 22 percent of the population registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai municipal population and family planning Commission said, many couples have children, " to help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and the reduction of the workforce in the future. "
He says that it's about " be old, it does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden. "
The gradual
As has been inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one - child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
The pair, who violated the policy, face enormous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work.
China's official positions advocated policies that helped the country to prevent the use of natural resources, while human rights defenders were sentenced to enforce the policy.
In rural areas, some officials urged pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have to undergo a sexist selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials were progressively less severe in its opinion on the one - child policy.
In 2004, as a general rule, letting výce exceptions - including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and in cases where a man and a woman were only child - and in 2007 to mitigate the diction of their passwords, the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the population research Institute of Beijing University, said that officials of the central government has previously debated the more radical changes, such as to enable couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters urge parents to have only one child, and replaced with a copy thereof, describing in detail how it would be legitimate to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration has sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under the door.
It also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The response was cool, said officials for planning families.
Zarmucující response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai experienced an increase in the interest of couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most of the precincts were reported changes.
Urban district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births in the city in 2010 was still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng, head of the Committee for family planning in Shanghai, said that financial considerations were likely the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, she said she would like to have two children, and they were legally allowed to be.
But like many Chinese, who have only a lack of health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without dociální a safety net could be the choice of irresponsible.
People in the West consider the one child policy as bad as a matter of legal question, says Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in association with the first child.
Yes, we have been deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples show the psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, manager of human resources, says that they have only one child, because she also was an only child: " We were the focus of our families and all of us.
We were not used for the provision of care and, in fact, we did not want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who have their own translation company, put it much nepokrytěji.
For dvoukariérové middle - class parents, who lowered birth rates, he said, be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30 years growing up my parents as is seen in the first days číského experiment with capitalism, and do not want this kind of a living for himself, he says.
Just one child places enormous demands on time parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice for at least two years of his social life.
Then there are issues propstoru - " you have to rebuild your apartment - and the strategy - " you must have a resume prepared when the child is 9 months for a good pre - school education.
Most of his friends, he wants to do with one child says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says.
We do not want to make too many victims.
The UN group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN - sponsored conference on climate change - and each other - again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations, most of the burden in the immediate term.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, stresses the remaining obstacles as well as the way forward.
But it was important to see progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week.
The UN working group created an ad hoc, on the text indicates how much money rich countries should provide the poor to deal with global warming in the short term and long term.
A provides a full range of options for the key issues, including how to develop and manage the emerging economies in order to reduce their output of carbon and what should be the upper limit for the increase in global temperature, which political leaders will be able to tolerate.
This dodábá process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, Senior Washington Representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested the document of the 180 pages of text for the meeting to focus on what a top official on the issue of climate change at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as a " big picture ".
Outlines the contours of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations could be collectively to reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to reduce to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union on Friday to discuss his promise to provide 3.6 trillion U. S. dollars over the next three years to help the poorer countries to adapt to climate change - from managing floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still, but on Friday said the same kind of verbal fireworks which prevailed at the talks in the last week.
U. S. Special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with the main emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration raised a harder line towards China, get outta officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States accede to the treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of actions, " said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to cover the restrictions and should be examined by outside observers.
Stern made this comment about an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the main U. S. negotiator on climate issues that either a lack of " common sense " or " exceptional " led to a week earlier in a statement that the United States would not help China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the world's major economic powers at stake, both within the developing world, and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fighting is mostly on the conservation of individual economies, rather than on the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States on the implementation of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point to the fact that two of the most influential countries in the world to ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of the action.
Ricardo Ulate, delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in the search for a way to prevent the large issuers responsibly in their actions.
This is clearly a play about the fact that new economic hegemony is developing, he said, which also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné the effects of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major parties, said that the best outcome of the talks will be the political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, has created a draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge - Metzger, who led the international negotiations on climate change in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations, " the whole process polirtický " partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India
Negotiations led to a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before the heads of government on the deal.
High - ranking officials, such as for example, the Indian Minister of environmental protection and the Chinese Deputy Minister of stepped out of the aircraft and ran through the halls Bella Center to the closed door meetings and conferences of the new chart so they could claim to be examined next week.
Total vastness Assembly - where 13,000 people a day move along on the convention center, and from the guitar playing activists staged at night ironic spectacle of the countries, which are believed to be sent, and there were proposals for the transfer from hand to hand on paper rather than by electronic mail - controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is only an extension: in Copenhagen were present at almost all of the key ministers and earlier in the middle of the 60 heads of state.
We got into the high category, " said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for global policy for international nature conservation.
Coming heavyweights.
The British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday feelings
At 5:13 In on Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the departure of the train, which meant a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high - speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras and the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Kelly Holmes and got into the first high - speed passenger trains outside lLndýn.
He hopes that the new service, where appropriate, or join the Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains, and joins a large agglomerations Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Neglected backwater should shorten transport times in passenger traffic and trade routes and the transition from aircraft and rail cars would reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties had left to get to this vision.
But dozens of bilinů pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental insults now constrain the development of the British high - speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2) , a company created in January to provide a government study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis December 30, as stated by the Times.
She gave him a detailed map of the routes of the next stage of the planned high speed network.
The new trace links London with the West was designed to five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods, where he would be on the propstředí could be problematic.
In the open country was scheduled to 25 m in the final route.
HS2 also expected to identify three broad options for high - speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will reply in the spring.
The preferred option is konfikurace Y - shaped, with one high - speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The track should share with one near the Birmingham, passing through the branches, the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
" It seems that it was the most effective choice, " he said, and a railway expert.
Once this is done, driving times between London and Edinburgh is reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before the year 2025, could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham for 49 minutes, compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to run at a speed of 2 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route has been proposed so as to hold the trains in the length of 400 m, which would have been able to carry 1100 people.
Up To 18 sets could operate every hour on the route London - Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve, if necessary, to 20 000 passengers per hour.
Due to capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be extended so as to include high - speed network.
Experts from železničníhoprůmyslu argues that only San Pancras International and Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not to implement this scheme, but a wide - ranging public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should be first put into service on the high - speed lines, but the existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is regarded as a critical point of contact for the transition from the aircraft to trains, a landmark for the revolution to rail.
Taxpayers pay the mortgage of $75,000 pounds on Tories
Alan Duncan, the holder of the chair - front benches in the House of Commons the taxpayers pay the cost thousands of pounds last year, which has built in his home in the electoral district.
A spokesman for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron that he complained that MPs were living " in the allocations, increased their mortgage to £ 75,000 to build an oak - paneled extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, total hundreds of pounds a month to taxpayers.
Local authorities have agreed to demands on time and was questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the control of the Member States. Last night, Mr Duncan said their requirements " to be cleaner and simpler. "
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, its own two - storey houses in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
The ground floor has a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial authority, agreed that Mr Duncan needs more space.
Last year, added to the house the winter garden, which is in the plans as " marked ".
Neighbors described her as " a greenhouse for fun and entertainment. "
Mr Duncan was asked to provide an explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection committee for the local standards and privileges in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The Committee told him last month that he broke the rules, after a review of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed pupillary security for a mortgage of £ 271,406 from his estate in London at a house in his constituency who had bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the Chamber of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed about 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest up to March last year.
In April, his demands have increased to more than 1800 pounds a month.
RBS mortgage Interest repayments of Mr Duncan could not change at this time, which suggests that it was intended to finance the loan of $75,000 pounds.
The Standard variable mortgage RBS fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, with the left.
The final document municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £ 1250 per month in May this year.
Mr Duncan has left his job as shadow leader of the House in September, after a secret one, and said that members must survive " on allocation " after the expenses scandal.
" In principle, it's, you have to live on the allocation and treated you like with t. "
He said: " I spent money on my garden and claim, and a small fraction of what had to be done.
And I could claim the full share of the damned, but I will not do it. "
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as a businessman with oil, was first asked to explain their issue in May, when it turned out that claimed thousands of pounds for your garden, before the approval of the tax office that it " can be regarded as excessive. "
One of the activists had dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in the character of Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed 4,000 pounds for a period of three years.
When he was asked last night to increase the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: " It was because of an increase in the capital, which was approved by the tax authority and then Legge. "
He added: " It is not a question of hiding and or violations of the rules or something else.
It's absolutely a straight line down, in accordance with the rules, and that's all.
It would be many other spůsoby cleaner and simpler. "

Associations UDF increases the tone, and calls on the side of the Nouveau centre to continued to shortcut.
The Association of the UDF party controlled MoDemFrançoise Bayrou on Friday responded to an attempt by the president to the Nouveau centre, Hervé Morin on appropriating shortcuts former Giscardovy parties agree that the acronym may be used in any medium, under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to steal a shortcut with the UDF, François Bayrou that you deserve to carry the inheritance after his hand left.
The Secretary of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned this strategy to confirm the Saturday before the National Council of movement Nouveau Centre (NC) .
This step has the support of the MEP Hervé de Charetta (for ex - UMP now for NC) , who assigns ownership of the UDF, because it was the first drop in 2004 to register in the National Institute of Industrial Property (Institut national de la propriété industrielle) .
But on a Friday evening, the committee of the Association of friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to let expropriating, stepped out of his silence and handed a formal request by the Minister to stop using the acronym and handed back ownership of the mark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.

Nouveau movement has no center, therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française) .
At the same time, they point out that the last Congress UDF voted in 2007 to connect to a modem for three years, and for the creation of a committee to defend " moral and material interests " Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards the Hervé de Charettea, continues with the committee, " when the registered trade mark ", not " for three years, a member of the UDF, " but the UMP.
Scandalous and fraudulently used the lack of registration of acronyms to do so on its own account.

But 15 criminal court also ordered a medical examination of the 87 - year - old Bettencourt, which should make the College of three doctors.
Heiress and the main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not on the terms offered to the public prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors, who will be elected on Friday, should draw up a report on 10 March 2010 and at the same time to comment whether the Liliane Bettencourt could find in a state of weakness, and in which the period.
I think that it undergoes.
The things I talk to her, said after the end of the hearing Mrs Bettencourt lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As the Attorney - Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's good news (...) . Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier) confirmed.
Are the two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt opened criminal proceedings against François - Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, which accused the state for years used the weakness of her mother, in order to obtain the gift of one billion euros in the form of cheques, contracts for life insurance or images.
But Liliane Bettencourt always refused, it would be a photographer, who is regarded as a long - term friend, manipulated.
While the court has had to assess the admissibility of an action brought by Mrs Bettencourt - Meyers, Friday's the speech of lawyers are sometimes changed in the family hour of truth.
The lawyer Liliane Bettencourt submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent his notaries, and in which it expressed its mistrust of her husband.
In a letter from the year 2003, according to the attorney, adding: " could you explain to my daughter that I wrote for a period of 15 years, once or twice a day.
Ever since they got married, I never talk. "
The State prosecutor in Nanterre again found that the complainant's conduct was not justified, the more than that, in these days of the judge rejected its request for the initiation of the procedure to the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully able to participate in the court, is not under the protection or in custody.
No one else for it not to act ' representative confirmed the Prosecutor, Marie - Christine Daubigneyová.
Finally, The Court ruled that the validity of Mrs Bettencourt Meyers - expressed at the time of the start of the process.
Managerial revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than ten years, is reminiscent of the behaviour of the managers of large companies employees access to business - to - consumer marketing before revolution: the point is to co - identify themselves with the " values " means identified from the mountain, as it was before, when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products which have emerged heads of the ideas factory technicians.
The fact that the customer has become a centre of entrepreneurial companies marketing strategy, the conquest of the market in the right direction ... even if the authoritarian efforts to impose on the products different from customer preferences, returning regularly!
Passive attitude of the staff can lead to death.
Suicide in companies France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the visible part of a much more general phenomenon, which affects mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And, indeed, EI " requires all interested parties (...) active approach and the ability to predict " and requires from employees who are completely at odds with the authoritarian revenue management.
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to bring the staff at the center of the interests of the company as well as a client.
The relative The usefulness of internal polls.
Internal polls - as the questionnaire submitted by the employees of the company Orange - will contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I was convinced that, in the face of the new situation, of the structure of the different turns back give priority to this ... you do what I always do!
Furthermore, because that authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, with the severity of their own failures.
And finally, because most of the executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of engineers have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience of thought are acquired by the old theory, currently again " from the US and re - animated " in the U. S. knowledge of the scientific institutes and the media.
In fact, it is possible to move the " levers " (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey of the Agency Ipsos Figaro. fr site, which only strengthens the management personnel in the position of a mechanical procedure, unfit for today's world.
To identify and measure the factors mobilization.
On the contrary, the revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, provides for the adoption of the definitive vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic insight into all the projects and practice management: for the employees of the commitments to the company will be possible only if they seem clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of the motivation of staff involved in the study only motivation functional analysis.
These studies have shown that their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxy, which will allow them to use through the image, which the company says, look at what to them to realize their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors, managers can mobilize to control, predict and pre - empted on their " social power ", and its management of human resources " on the right path ".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence.
The result of the Oslo accords: " just war " Obama has earned praise from the right.
The American right - wingers on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama made the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who initially ridiculed the award Obama 9th October, this time a presidential speech applauded, including Sarah Palin, the former vice - presidential candidate in elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, muse of right - wing Republican, for the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself is the subject " sometimes necessary " war expressed in his memoirs, which are based.
The war is, of course, the last thing the Americans would like to have a job, but it is necessary.
All the terrorists, there is to be held, he said.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its předchůdciGeorge W. Bush on Thursday in Oslo, justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan for nine days before.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, said that the president did in Oslo, " a very good job ".
I think that the speech was really very good, and a former chairman of the House of Representatives, which especially appreciated the President's mention of " the existence of evil in the world ".
In a way, I thought the speech as fully historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio " The Takeaway ".
A former Member, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012, was delighted to see " leftist president, " the members of the Committee for the Nobel Prize, " that they would not be free and for peace, if the use of force was ".
According to Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama made a " very American speech ".
Not only was introduced as a " cosmopolitan " as always, but " speaking as an American President " and reminded Europeans " that they live in a bubble, which themselves that they do too much for it to keep it " evaluated and Gerson.
Among the few malcontents from the right is the hawk Bush era, a former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, who called the speech ", pompous and without inspiration, " as stated on the website of the National Review Online.
To the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama, as justifies the use of force.
" When the war packed into a container of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, " he warned.
However, medium - leftist press is of the opinion of the President of praise.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the peace Prize for early reviewed his output as " nadvýkon " and even speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo accords should serve as a guide to the international decision in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression places a California newspaper.
Obama " speech that was said to be " the New York Times, and a sign marked " for single and instructive.
Road carriers: three marathons to the agreement, which will save the supply of stocks for Christmas.
After three negotiating ran marathons and road transport carriers out of the trade unions, the employers ' organisations, which remained until the end, on Friday night to the agreement, which ended the call to strike and the threat that hung over the supply of stocks at Christmas.
Secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau on Friday at the signing of the agreement expressed " joy " and that after several negotiations, which started on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions with the negotiators on Friday early morning broke up, with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
And in spite of the fact that three of the employers ' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, withdrew from the negotiations.
But it was the need for more than six hours of meetings, which began at 11 hours, to ensure that all agreed and in 18 hours podepsaliznění agreement.
This conflict would be very hurt " and " there would be a danger that will be distorted by the holidays at the end of the year, " he said.
The text of the text includes wage increases of 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport) .
Hourly wages for the lowest salaries increased from € 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but it's in a lot of effort, he explained Patrice Clos (FO) .
Tonight we'll give our members to avoid blockades, no blockade of supply centres.
But it may occur for a few opponents, who are not satisfied, " he added.
Philippe Grillot, president, welcomed the " good deal ", although it was hard to admit to the increase of high salaries due to international competition.
According to him, an increase of 170 per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) , while Thierry Douine (CFTC) has welcomed the " historic agreement ".
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT) are " acceptable compromise ".
The agreement also envisages upgrading the travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of the state road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the issue of the salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements.
Bussereau said " a reduction of 100 million euros in taxes from the wages of which was the subject of the government on the amendment of the draft law on the budget for the year 2009 to vote on the night of Thursday to Friday from the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to " identical " vote.
Signature allows that this agreement will apply initially to businesses that are members of the organization, the entire field in an extension of the Ministry of Labor.
Take place " as soon as possible, " he said.
The whole process can only impede the opposition of employers ' organisations.
Organization FNTR speaks of " bad business " for 100 million euros " have already been offered in the sector, of the part of the carbon tax ".
Secretary of State for Transport we forced the emergency meeting not as a result of an analysis, but to anger turkey eaters during the Christmas holidays approaching, she complained at the time of the Unostra.
For the organization, the danger is that the agreement in the next 12 months " to kill a large number of small and medium - sized enterprises in the field ".

The Interruption of service, suburban train RER A, which is the largest line of urban public transport in France, will continue over the weekend, because Friday's meeting between the unions and management on the second day of strike action had resulted in concrete results in otázcežádosti of the premium.

As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France and arranged for other platforms nevládl confusion.
So early in the morning, it was in the station Saint - Germain - en - laye (Yvelines) far fewer people than usual, inter alia, also because they were lacking pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years from Boissy - Saint - Léger (Val - de - Marne) explained that he stood for " an hour and a half early to be sure they arrive on time.
The Saint - lazare railway station was overcrowded, announced the state railway SNCF, predicted with the larger number of ushers and security guards.

The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, " closer to review the conditions for the exercise of the profession, " said RATP transport companies.
Which was the reason why the union believes that the company " makes fun weekend travelers.
In the morning hours, about 150 drivers occupied the works council in his Paris headquarters.

The Turkish justice dismissed for the Kurdish side and this decision brings with it grave consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to cancel the main pro - Kurdish party in the country. the decision immediately triggered a protest demonstration s in the Kurdish community in the south - east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of government, which is trying to provide a hand of friendship to the Kurdish community and try to attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
Party for the Democratic Society Party (DTP) was disbanded because it has become " activities against the independence of the state and its indivisible unity, " said the chairman of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of the negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, when for the dissolution of the parties to the most - needed seven votes, he said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president and the ban to participate in political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which was used by Mr and Mrs Tugluková and confiscation of property by the Ministry of Finance.
The party has 21 seats in Parliament (500) .
The Party leadership has indicated before The verdict that members of Parliament rather than leave it served as members of no political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of a process initiated in 2007, the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, which accused the DTP of obedience to the " commands " Party of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) , which Ankara and many countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase rebels from the PKK.
Page assures that the PKK has no " essential link ", but refuses to label it a terrorist organization, and calls on the government to negotiating with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community, a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights and trying to limit the support of Kurds against the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP executives confirmed that the dissolution of the parties could lead to a renewal of tensions in the southeast Anatolia, where in recent weeks, many demonstrations against the conditions under which the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in clashes with the police.
From the notification of the decision of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the seat of the DTP in Diyarbakir, a big city in the southeast, mostly inhabited by the Kurds.

Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice " will deepening despair.
Turkey is not the question (the Kurds, red. ) to resolve the ban, said in the press.
The government, consisting of a party came from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are in principle against the interference of the parties.
It does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is an absolute shooting democratic proposals, which were initiated by the government, said political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for reaction from the PKK, he said.
On Thursday, the PKK subscribed to one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed three days earlier, seven soldiers.
The new Silicon - Valley
For years, the city paid for the secret, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was a closely guarded site where there is carried a secret weapons research.
Today, it is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from Moscow's Center, the " Silicon Valley. "
There are significant micro - and research and production center.
Since September 2008 established zelenogradští contacts with representatives of the Frankfurt scientific centre Riedberg - with university institutions and firms Frankfurt Innovation centres (FIZ) .
There has been a number of mutual visits and signed on Wednesday in Frankfurt and the Protocol on the " close cooperation ".
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow vícestarosta Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, head of the planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives will go FIZ and small and medium - sized enterprises involved in research at a seminar přírodovědeckým in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But It is also about economic relations.
FIZu companies will be allowed to implant in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, the Russian scientific companies want to get the contract in Germany.
Zelenograd Russia is home to major research institutes and companies.
These should include the Moscow Institute of electron technology, large corporations and Sitronics Rossiyskaya electronics.
The District was founded in 1958 as a so - called " socialist planned city " for weapons research.
(the literal translation of " green City ") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape, which are placed in research facilities.
Stuttgartská brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 simply can not adequately prepare.
For fans of the project, it is quite simply a " new heart of Europe ".
Good. S21 is more than run the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital of Baden - Württemberg for a decade building a desperate chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
The top station with the track, which ended in the centre of the city, was then considered to be at that time in the 19th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, because it was the need for much time from back to front.
Go, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
And that's why the station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the routes of the trans - European highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of " the heart of Europe ".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 80 years are no longer compatible with reality.
Ourselves very ambitious designers know that, and the city is almost the start of construction.
Since then, as there is a modern shuttle trains and motor vehicles to control at both ends, they don't have problems with the station and vyjížděním.
Yet: It starts with the Stuttgart 21, with a new track ICE to Ulm.
Asserting that the prefects and local politicians.
Track together, and because of the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by the taxpayer and not the state.
Urban, the project is still some way to apologize.
A new urban space, which - if we are to believe the computer images of designers - will include a lot of green.
For rail transport system is harmful.
The Transit station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80 years - highlighted the huge increase.
Then there was no competition from low - cost flights.
Modern transport policy must go but first and foremost on the strengthening of the freight, because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than the freight car on the road.
But the new line is not due to a steep climb suitable for freight trains.
Even more important is that the S21, indirectly affects many other railway projects.
In Swabia be good to bury six billion euros.
This is the official number.
Experts consider to be the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade will lack funds to other nodal points and bottlenecks in the network.
On the list of the Ministry of Transport is a larger projects.
One of the most important is the construction of the approximately 180 kilometers long route through the valley of the shadow of the Rhine.
Since 1987, this route puts slow pace.
There would be a need to really push.
But it will be as a brake.
The track of the Rhine valley becomes a bottle neck of international freight transport in the heart of Europe.
The government is studying the judgment on the airport
The provincial government has in the face of the open, if he goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice (VGH) to ban night flights and allow him to reconsider.

It is hard, if you can keep his word, " said the head of green Tarek referring to the FDP election slogan " we hold the word.
The Minister rejected the charge, the provincial government is trying to force through " misstating the law and tricks " to get to their night flights.
The precise legal control needs time.
The coalition wants to work on the basis of " a quick first impression. "
We need a realistic decision, " said Stefan Müller (FDP) .
Statements of his faction to ban night flights were never such as given by the opposition.

Speed Dial
It was to do a faster than expected.
Station successor unveiled just two weeks after the board pushed out of the office ZDF editor Nikolaus Brender.
Last night he wanted the panel to agree on that person.
For the favorite was called Peter Frey, the head of the studio in the capital city of Berlin.
The station, but it has not been proven - officially to the process.
Could play a role but also that they would not harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schachter, if this proposal at the board failed.
Frey, Schächterův candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the panel.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the close of this issue.
Two weeks ago, foundered on the Governing Board Schachter with its proposal to extend the contract for another five years.
For Brendera vote only seven members, seven were against him. Brenderova loss of the mandate was for the bitter defeat, although she expected.
Union's majority in the Governing Board of the signal for several weeks before the election, that he did not want the office to confirm.
Opposition to Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in office highly weighted of the editor of the argument that the monitoring quotas fell Brender, ZDF news.
Until shortly before the election because of the protests, in which he was sharply criticized by the political influence on ZDF.
The last time in the debate even 35 constitutional lawyers who practice Koch evaluated as unconstitutional.
It was to no avail.
The person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and Romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to " heute - journal ".
Next stop: 1988 to 1990 personal referent editor, Washington correspondent for 1991/92, leading to 1998 and moderator of " the Morgenmagazins "; in 2001, the head of foreign policy since the head of the main study ZDF.
After being Brender, who was on Wednesday elected in the middle of a professional journalist of the year, deposed, the Greens announced that they submitted the constitutional claim.
Kochův opponent of the Administrative Board, Rhineland - Palatinate Premier Kurt Beck, said last week that the country would change the federal government contract with ZDF to the state so that the staff could not be blocked by the politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude partisan politics from the supervisory boards ZDF.
Brenderův expected successor, Peter Frey, the Governing Board commanded a clever chess move - immediately after the toppling Brender panel will consider strongly criticized for it.
With this evidence of journalistic independence, he could be nominated for the post of editor without losing face as so he could be elected by the management Board, without getting into the suspicion that he would be expelled through the office.
In the arithmetic of the party anyway Frey classified left - wing liberals.
The study of the junk
A partial success for students: after a year of picketing on Thursday, finally drove the Länder ministers of culture: at the conference of ministers of culture and the university presidents, both sides agreed that it will improve conditions for the bachelor's degree and a Masters.
Students should in future be able to handle their study.

The so - called accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests to drastically reduce in part: " each module will be terminated, as a one test, " says the 30 - page report, which is part of the approval of new studies.
" Significantly lower examination burden, " said the chairman of the accreditation Council Reinhold Grimm, should be " stopped mistakes, which significantly limited the performance of studies. "
The study should be " performance " in the future, " the decisive criterion " in implementation.

Courses.
Students should be " entitled to a space, which allows and encourages individual initiative.
The rules are to apply for approval of the new study, after a review, but also for the current study.
You need to be " přeakreditovat " every five years - which, however, means that it will take until 2015 before they checked all fields of study.

At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to submit to Parliament an amendment to the higher education Act.
According to the study by the end of the module should be required only a single test.
The Formation of study should be more flexible, to be guaranteed by the recognition of tests from other universities and to facilitate access to the disclosure of the master's degree.

Second, the Land to ensure that today's generation of students for undergraduate courses was tomorrow, there are insufficient places in the Masters ' fields of study with the best conditions, " said a member of the board of directors GEW Andreas Keller.
The Federal land, to employ far more speakers.
The Ministers of Culture, however, have free access to the Master's programmes.

Obviously uncomfortable and left dumbfounded Söllner declaration in front of fellow writers Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Frauendorferem, admits to working as a secret informant Romanian secret service of the Securitate.
Together with some of the present Söllner acquired in 1989, the German language.
Attempts at recruiting apparently began quietly, first in 1971.
I went Söllner, " so someone who did not sufficiently attempts at intimidation by the Securitate. "
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize, and Herta Müller's unparalleled literary settlement mechanisms with the dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly a community of German authors from Romania, shaken by a case that indicates the depths and political system, which is based on the control and špicování.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said in the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but it is also a victim.
In the Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after the award Söllnerově Michael Markel and referred to the positive effect on him of a secret agent Walter.
" Vysekával " me that in all important respects to him, says Markel.
He Has a moral obligation to make this note.
Söllnerovo statement was in this form and before the audience the unexpected, but very surprising return of former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when reading their own deeds, 914 pages, that Germany was a reserve for the Securitate.
Concerned, it can be assumed, will be to speculate, and in some cases, I know that the name is hidden behind the code name, and just as well Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, has since become a look at some components of stasis, is handling the estate control Securitate still very diffuse.
In the past few years, it has been a systematic education and restricted.
One of the Birthlerových offices, which corresponds to the National Council for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS) , was founded in 1999, the issue of the act took place, since more lengthy.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of folders.
That former members of the Securitate in Romania still has a big influence, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller a conversation in which one of the former Securitate leaders from Timisoara, commented on the awards.
He has, after all, was questioned only once.
Condemnation can be expressed quite openly here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that is not the case, as in the context of zamlčeným guilt, linked the inevitable questions.
Why now? who was hurt? Specific responses to return, it leaves the audience to expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote.
With the Champions League
It looked as if he came clean clothes sales representative from a cute Christmas party, where the sporting goods manufacturer distributed sweets, when he took a quarter of an hour after midnight to new coach Christian Gross, accompanied by orange - colored bag sponsor.
The man with the ball that marked for him after he had brought him, even a foreign city.
Otherwise it could drive itself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with happiness was 55letý man too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we will continue to work.
Or is it just begins.
In the words of a committed only three days from Switzerland: " although we have reached the fourth round, in the Champions League thanks to výhře3 1 over Unirea Urziceni in Romania, " but we must not let the dazzle of success: It's a brutally tough fight against the descent. "
" Far more important task " is in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the exercise in Mainz and in the royal class of ordinary league date.
And to avoid the recurrence of the obvious weaknesses after three quick gólech Maricy (5) , Träsche (8) and (11) .
Sortition
Round of Champions League (match 16. + 23/24 February/retaliation match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will draw lots for the 18th December in Nyon.
The joy of třeskavého taking Babbelova successor will therefore be maintained.
Not only the alleged healer is uncertain Stuttgart professionals said during a short period of self - confidence, willingness to deploy and the joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths, and I told them to be more adventurous, a healer of souls Gross explained as simple - sounding recipe for success, but which, under both the therapist Babbel but he did not show any effect.
Spurred some magic, admitted Babbelův adherent Jens Lehmann, " when in football there's momentum, they become sometimes things that you did not see it as possible. "
Sami Khedira and who, after a break caused by injury, became, thanks to its dynamism as the best player on the field, he tried to describe the " phenomenon " proverbial " fresh wind " and working procedures of the new manager: " He's a man who is a radical and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
In Babbel's obviously missing.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been saved, warns sports President Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability.
As gross want neither players and managers overestimate the victory against a weak substitute and completely congested defense Romanian guest.
Glasgow would have won even before awakening came after an ugly 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, considering Khedira.
A sports President Horst Heldt reminded that they have achieved one objective in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're over the hump.
That Heldt at its 40th celebrate birthdays or even after the first domestic victory after three months, was due to weekend events, which recently revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann Jensem just before the start of the game.
Decisions, which active than others, and Jens, Heldt said the hard Lehmann's criticism.
Předhazoval weak management and the board decided to change the coach after pressure teenage fans.
And that was canceled his day off after the games, described as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's remarks " formulates net egoism, " said Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalie.
Both in their 40s will probably no longer have the joy of life.
In any case, the one with the other, that without the work of the deposed trenérského team would not be so strong and combative players ' performances.
Babbel and his aides had " a large share of success, " says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with a plastic bag agrees.

A Total of passive Johnson did it for so little and tried to get into the other.
Although provoked by While the words and gestures, but it beats the world champion hit only rarely.

Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: the head of the green Jürgen Trittin called because of the bad information on the affairs of Kunduz Defense as a liar.
The SPD and the Linke (left) Chancellor invited to submit an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - according to the latest knowledge to raid on the Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Defense Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Minister for The deadly bombing of two tanks in September said " intentionally false ", said the head of the green Jürgen Trittin in Saturday's news show ARD " Tagesschau ".
Call it the usual expression: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) .
This is the essence of the message, which was NATO, he had read Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not only the destruction of the hijacked truck, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban.
When the American bombing, which claimed the German commander, Colonel Klein, NATO has been under investigation for manslaughter and injury to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Link called on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) , to immediately expressed the assembly and also clarify what he really knew about this event.
Ms Merkel must explain whether it is part of a strategy of the targeted killings of the Afghan policy - and, if the Chancellor, and the intelligence of this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin called a colleague from the Green Party Renate Künastová.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Office of Chancellor has no effect on the actual deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also voiced doubts about the make - up of the Ministry of the background of the release of the Inspector General and the Secretary of State Peter Wicherta.
According to the information from Spiegel inform both guttenberg correctly and fully on the background of the attack on the tanker.
Officially it was said that they had to deny the existence of the reports of NATO and the Minister of sensitive details.
From both of the top officials, however, warned that the Department of Defense even several reports, including the two - page document commanding Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
" Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung " report that Wichert, meanwhile, had the request in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that so far has received no response.
The Ministry on Saturday did not comment on complaints and pointed out that this will be addressed at the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be appointed next Wednesday.
Worlds dreams
Some see the images in the waking state and hear voices that other people can see and hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication blur the boundaries between imagination and reality.
Until this occurs during sleep, everything is fine.
If we closed our eyes in a dark room, we may surround the and delusions.
But who is experiencing a dream - like states of vigilance, hear and see things that others can see and hear, is in today's the Western world for a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as a result.
But such images and voices that do not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Guilt is our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there, they will take care of it, that the border between the dream and reality.
The Dreams of the altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best, we call them a vision, at worst, delusional.
Even if the initiator and the effect may vary, but it mystical visions Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet New - Age Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of mania, psychoses and hallucinations derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when there is a derailment of the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain - particularly dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine, and interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
A comprehensive hallucinations and wandering thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The link between the dreams and delusions of employed doctors and philosophers since antiquity.
Aristotle understood as a form of hallucination, a dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, said in 1861 " the great similarity ravings with dream states, the Sigmund Freud was a dream even " psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusions, deception of the senses. "
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. is amended in comic figure.
His body is a two - dimensional and brightly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, floating in the ceiling of the room.
Feels kick up the backside.
Behind him, a winged figure with the devil red blood grimace, baring teeth.
Chasing him, kick him in the heavy, fiery shoes, throwing him on the wall, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Loud, bad voices from the walls and on the radio.
We can not tolerate voices that curse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, zauzlí it into a loop and fastened it on a hook on the ceiling.
Stand up to one speaker and you can loop around the neck.
Jump.
Loop.
Learn, a chorus of voices tearing his eardrums, " go to the clinic to be treated! "
It is now 40 years old, has had six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first in nearly 20 years ago.
They were running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoid psychosis, besides a manic - depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with their disease, three years is married.
In psychosis, I had the worst fear and deep doubts, he says.
The Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is the second most commonly depression treatment of disease.
Acute schizophrenic psychosis are not affected most of them can distinguish between the internal and external world, moving into přebuzeného condition, that can lead to hallucinations, velikostním, or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that Command, comment or maintain dialogue.
Neither optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The person is not able to distinguish between the important from the unimportant, the brain can filter out spurious signals, consciousness is flooded with emotions.
Like a dream opens the floodgates flooding psychosis, of ideas and fantasy, which come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is concentrated on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the clinic general psychiatry, university clinic in Heidelberg.
A schizophrenic is located in the centre of the stage, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, getting into a passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and can actively shape.
It is therefore often feel threatened, manipulated and controlled.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible for them, they are a terrible reality, waking up is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucinations
Otherwise than in a dream, she says, " but still the sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, substantially preserved. "
Wandering thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality and experience of alienation is a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brain is doing exactly the sort of twists.
Special conditions may result from one person to lose the fact that in the short - term relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone, however, develop into psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have a minimum of brain damage.
We believe that in the early stage of development of the damage to the brain, for example, such as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery, as there is a failure of the system, which for years did not materialise.
Factors also play a role of the effects of the neighborhood - stress or traumatic experiences may be, if it is to her disposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because the transmission system.
When our brains
Crazy is that their psychotronici suffers from hallucinations, and to get rid of them, and swallowed an expensive medication, while others give money for drugs to be gained, he says, a professor of psychology.
If the images we perceive as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and in the last year, results in a book, " Die Welt in unserem Kopf " (the world in our head) .
Although hallucinations are the typical phenomena accompanying psychoses, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depressive illness often as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, and by a healthy person's brain.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of the ideas, which are normally suppressed.
Arise, when the part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, too little repressed or active, if our brains, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can run this state as well as the brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimulus, stress, worry about love or other more exceptional conditions.
In the most recent studies, and one third of respondents had reported that at least once in her life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Vorpommern and walk to a nearby school.
In fact, a normal girl.
If there were not the patterns and voices.
The breaks may be that it will appeal to kolohnát with long, dark hair.
When he replies, looking at her classmates with a surprise - no one except her see and hear the boy.
This shy girl as a dreamer, but Sarah K., knows it.
He is awake, hears and sees the boy, just as they hear and see the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, is like the boy.
I'm crazy? , he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears.
In the night are rather disappointing appearances
Delusions are often a burden.
When sitting in class, not how many times following the instruction as a teacher in her eyes and ears was a new classmate, but he said while all other audible and visible on the board of the mathematical equation.
At night the phenomena rather depressing.
While waiting in a dark room to sleep, which is rarely and too late, often can not distinguish, if it's awake or if, if the images he sees, grimacing, or cutting a girl with bleeding wounds on the hands and feet are open or closed.
Leave me alone, shouting at the figures.
Parents and friends say anything about it, thought it about her that was crazy.
The autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year she graduated high school and live with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since that time she contacted on the Internet psychologist Kasten knows exactly that mad.
The images are also art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or had removed incentives will likely hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough work and cares for his own amusement.
Sarah, an only child, she was like a little girl, fear of the other children, often playing herself.
The hallucinations began in 13 when he learned that the man who called my dad from the days when she thinks is her own father.
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain regions that process the real sensations and sounds, for people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from each other and reality. " every experience, " says, " takes place in the brain, the reality shows there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain occur, so the real work. "
Also the night dreams as a form of delusion.
Healthy people does not differ substantially from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics are psychologically healthy people will be able to identify their errors as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advise their patients to evaluate the hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dreams and hallucinations
In our world concentrated too much on the consciousness is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, the majority patologizován, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic - Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is heavy, útrpná disease, but it also provides positive, creativity - a mirage is also the art of despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard the so - called oneiroidní form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroidní states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which is considered to be the real issue and can not be distinguished from or re - waking state.
Oneiroidní consciousness arises in the extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as inflammation polyradikulárním patients who experience the full knowledge of motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and herself, to be continued, the inability to move, replaced by the real life - threatening own, an imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt - Degenhard.
The type Species status of the borders between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change in the world, the real situation but zpřítomní the idea.
The Intensive form of aid and the transfer of the senses in an intolerable situation, which allows people to our own ability to shape, move in an instant loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, and later in the memory
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen oneiroidní describes his experiences in his book " the exchange " (heart) as a rescue mission of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when, after the heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation published his consciousness on several track, with his body lay motionless on the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into a world he created, visited a foreign time and place: it is becoming an old man on the bed in a nursing home, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the nobility, which produces narcotic substances from the blood.
The bike he kidnaps Řek to their homeland, in a hospital bed in the Alps, and meets the Korean.
Completely immersed in the imaginary wrong, everything is real, and later in memory.
These internal travel for Claussena fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different status, describes his experience.
In contrast to the dreams are memories of those mental disorders even after many years and non - essential details clearly obvious.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
After all, show oneiroidní states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also waking up our internal images of external reality.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, " may lead to distortion of what we call reality. "
The fact that can also be rewarding.
The snow may come
Burda
In the 27 children to take over the publisher
New head of publishing Kallen is a temporary solution: long - term Hubert Burda wants to hand over their business in the hands of their two children, said der Spiegel.
Holding is also in the future include 100 percent family.
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the long term in the hands of their children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the firm, says the man.
The details are to be handled carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, will be taken later.
And the question of whether they have the ability.
It is not possible to take the lead in 7500 workers their children if they are not sufficiently capable of.
That would kill both children and business.
Burda on Thursday announced that from January withdraws from the Presidency of the Board of directors, and appointed as his successor, Paul - Bernhard Kallen.
52 years old is a Member of the board of directors since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with added responsibility for the assets of the company's and the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera the direct marketing, Foreigners, printing and finance.
For the first time in publishing, at the head of any of the members of the family.
Burdovým children is 19 and 17 years, his son, Felix, who would today be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment also serves to make sure we " bridge the 10, 15 years, " said Burda.
Holding the future should include 100 percent family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases, and Schickedanz, the Schaeffler Burda said that neither the family businesses do not have confidence before the agency: " It touched always companies that they had been infected by a desire for equity, which have speculated and thought that they could become great players.
It has never been my strategy.
He never had " dreams of a world power, " says Burda.
I do not see as a political preceptor of the country, like Springer, and I want to play the World League with " Time ", these shops are too big.
Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to explore the mail, without the ability to view a particular type of attachments or surfing the web.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U. S., when Time magazine praised it as one of the products of the year.
It is difficult to see him out there, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the Peek is characterised by a very low price and the monthly payments, less than half the amount, for example, for the data plan for the iPhone.
After his success, the company has started offering two new devices: one is designed exclusively for Twitter and the other on the basis of the data services provided free of charge, for which it is necessary to pay for the Peak amount.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday to the Web site, is the European version of the invention, and at the same time, his third transformation.
It is limited, as well as his American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
Monthly price for maintenance is around 12 euros a month and includes roaming across Europe.
The people of the passengers already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently search café with WiFi connection (or Fon) , so they can see the mail.
The idea of rooming with a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be put in place for a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics, in order to understand them, and very good glasses so he could read the tiny letters.
The European Commission has requested to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is justified concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that remains is the name Fon, he does not have this type of fare, means that operators are beginning to think otherwise and considering the various offers, kterýmiby compensate for its data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers downloads of books and other search on the Internet.
No contract, no complications.
This device is connected and pay for the purchase, rather than months.
And that's exactly what I expect that one comes in, it is a possibility to purchase permanent access to the peek has already been introduced in the U. S..
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I am looking through the mail, on the phone, thank you.
I expect it, because I think that it's from the point of view of the consumer, the best type.
It would be interesting if the same system used in the computer.
Color, kterouzbožňuje Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color of the first Lady.
For Barack Obama for the office of U. S. President chose to dress and coat in the color, the same color can also be chosen when accompanying him on the second most important moment of his life: the transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition is a similar color - lime with effects - in both cases, it was the three - piece set - clothes, bags and coat of the same substance - embroidered or decorated with a large collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States has decided to follow in the footsteps of Princess of Asturias and wear similar clothes.
The substance, which is made up of clothes, makes two very different models.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace in Oslo velvet with prints.
Amended and add: green shoes with medium - high podpadkem, nynípodobný model, but in a golden colour.
They wear different hairstyles: tentokrátdrdol, before her hair.
75% of working mothers have to work problems associated with maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who intend to buy a child.
This is the result of the study's fertility and the working lives of Spanish women ', which, in cooperation with the Institute for women.
The study included 9737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited options in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership co - existence are many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, working part - time or do not have a stable job, starting with a partner to live before their first child before giving birth and generally have more children.
From the other side, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, the partner coexistence and maternity postpone, and have fewer offspring.
" Women from 35 to 49 years with a stable job with their first child at an average of 3.7 years from the beginning of living with a partner. the figure of 4.1 for women, kterédosažení his stable job to pay the greater part of my life and, therefore, had to postpone and the arrival of children.
The type of employment is also a strong influence on maternity, although a smaller influence on the opening of living with a partner, " said Delgado, who is devoted to research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of a child is the level of education.
Research indicates that the higher the level of education, the higher is the age when women marry and have their first child.
The differences are also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with the basic and higher education given birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 32.1.
" There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education to marry and bear their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education act opposite prefer to obtain stable employment before marriage and birth of first child ", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representative: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress becomes the face of the different products under the brand universal slogan ' Cause I stand for '.
Representative ' Joyeux Noël ', one of the most elegant actresses international level, thus adding to the famous Paris osobnostemL'Oréal such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Penélope Cruz.
Before it joined the club selected actress Evangeline Lilly (" lost ") and Freida Pinto (' Slumdog Millionaire ') .
Men of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important artists: Patrick Dempsey (" Gray's anatomy ") and Matthew Fox (Evangelinin partner in the ' lost ') .
The price of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the affairs of fashion.
Their most prominent leaders - designers and models, past and present - gathered at the annual ceremony, which took place in London, the Court of Justice.
At the meeting, no one missing.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model year.
Poker Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicent donations in ' esový poker ' (Alfaguara, illustrations Fernando Vicente) thirty radiographs writers, whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases, even in everyday life) .
Does so in a fearsome and predictable genre (biographical similarities, life and work) , but is looking for something like the creative personality.
The path brings excitement and inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader's delight, even in repeated reading.
Here are some observations.

In itself, he said, that she is the beneficiary of the farmer from the county, sometimes the son of the black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was larger than life dreams. "
The Louis - Ferdinand Céline: " this writer caught the bridge, a cry of this man from Munich to its echo in on the night of the 20th century in their literary form, and in the future and to the worms. "

A: " What else was Martín Santos, than to focus on?
What else was going to have to execute than Faulknerovou weapons?
What else could Celovi than do the famous at the expense of the glory of that man? "
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother was going through our neighborhoods, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years and our dog rescued from the shelter of the weight of more than six pounds, without a word it twice and kicked severely wounded.
Our anger is all the more that we do not see anything funny in such an aggression against a small and helpless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident while on a walk with these individuals, she began to worry about his own safety, since such a devil of a man who attacks the animal is able to do the same, as a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he was.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
Dog all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the nearest police station, but I doubt that it was, and to a tricky question, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationality.
Outrage forced us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what is happening with today's youth, when they talk that troubled defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not understand where you happened to good manners, respect for animals and people.

Since January, prodáno95. 853 vehicles, which includes all kinds of vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, vans, small trucks and light trucks/bogies.
And not even the gloom, or the most damaging inquiry, even if bought by private individuals, the majority of purchases made small and medium - sized enterprises and almost 100% of the cases, the financing through third parties.
The constraints resulting from the closure of bank loans, the source must be added other factors such as the cessation or continuation of bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike cars, support for the purchase of 2000E helped too.
In addition to private individuals, it is to be noted iosoby business to business license small and medium - sized businesses, which they intend to buy a car of 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions levels exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.

The measures introduced in the EU aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians, the works so that it can help to avoid the many collisions.
The hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, this system detects when the driver presses.
But not always able to keep this pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of automotive parts Bosch, a third of the drivers who have an accident, nesešlápli brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the full power of the brakes.
Up to 1100 accident
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum braking systems, reducing the stopping distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, it could be avoided and 1 100 fatalities per year related to pedestrians.
Reducing this number will be even more marked - from calculations in order to prevent one of the four incidents affecting the person - after the introduction of the so - called intelligent systems handbrake.
In this case, the vehicle is fitted with a system that (using radar or cameras) captures the obstacles and reports that the driver, except for a light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if it is needed.
If the driver does not react, even in the case where a collision can not be avoided, the device will be what impressed on the brakes and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.

Its behavior can be described only as inviolable.
A reduction in the weight does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary: we no longer so small and light model, which is transmitted at the same time a safety in the movement in the corner, even at high speeds.
It's a little athlete, able to warm up the muscles for a short ride for the required time, until he nenařídíme sprint, braking, and restore the use of the engine.
Whatever we want. thanks to the proceedings, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever naznačíme hands on the steering wheel, which is what the car will do.
And make it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to the will of
The sound of a boxer, 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very important and it is possible to exaggerate the possibility of ' sport ' and a system which modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used for.

Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when inflation assets represented the prevailing mood in the markets, on the uncertainty in the markets, which should not come as a surprise, since this is already a natural state in an environment where managers adopted decisions on the future, which is itself an uncertain.
The drug is used by central banks to stabilize the debt market was the realization by direct purchase of assets and liquidity in the indirect release rate close to zero, the financial institutions to buy the asset to the deduction.
The Central bank has already confirmed that direct purchases of assets, has virtually ended, and without doubt its disparate policy of liquidity, starting to throw some sand into the gears, as it made the Spanish Central Bank, with its auctions in the last year.
Investors therefore challenge the ability of the world economy to keep the economic recovery without the heterodox arrangements, and of participating in the return of the reduction in the risk of the proceeds.
Mobility and Exchange differences dluhopisůspolečností regain points, although they are still very distant abnormal level, which have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected the public debt.
Again, the pressure on the quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the selected investors, thereby expanding the differentiation of the euro area countries to Germany.
Spain this instability almost was affected, but at that time came, Standard& Poor's and threatened a new revision of the reduction in the capacity of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for the supporters of moral hazard, who again tried to charge to the conscience of the persons responsible for the world's economic policy because of the devastating consequences of limiting credit on employment, when in fact they would need to declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal fight between the Emir to restore power in the Emirates, and as for Greece, that we have seen before.
The government, which covers the deficit, the election and the new government is.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and the Socrates of Portugal, Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense that the Ecofin saving Hungary from failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year, and to allow member countries of the euro has not fulfilled its obligations.
But what makes sense, it is that the Ecofin forced the Greek government to transparency and of its people to a shared responsibility for the necessary emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the standardisation of the transitional risk premium, after some of the positions would be in line with expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in the public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry about.
If Europe is reduced and our differences will be further extended, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The Standard& Poor's is a joke. When our leading indicators are to most of the majority of studies anticipate the renewal of its scenarios and revise its scenario increases for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy it does not bode well for a great chance to meet the survival of the alert.
Once again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy the assets of Spanish, as being " careful, the driver ".
