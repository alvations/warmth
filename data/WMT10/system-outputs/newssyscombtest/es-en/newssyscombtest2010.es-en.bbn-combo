The lack of snow in the mountains of concern the hotel
Not only the of Telesquíes in are concerned about the runways without snow.
The lack of snow makes people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why, in krkonoše can still be free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and.
We have many visitors in our pages.
People look offers, the prices, but still fear of book with commitment.
And if we call, ask immediately on our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud, "mentioned the of portal information spindl. info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to move in a mlýn according to their expectations, should not hesitate more in reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Špindlerův Mlýn offer especially weekly stays for.
I believe that will continue to offer, but soon and offer shorter stays.
And then the rooms free will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all the dates of winter.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats remains free.
That is why we have already prepared some stays at the last moment, "said the director of Ingtours Petr.
The travel agency of vrchlabí still can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
Sold very well the first 14 days of February, the remaining dates are sold.
This year the interest in the winter is hampered by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to move to the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the roads remain snowfall during the week, the dates of Christmas will dry up, "said Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to fill the rooms in the hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately five per cent better.
For Christmas and the New Year's Eve, we have the latest free.
The Polish interest increases during the holidays in January and February also sold well, "said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the New Year's Eve stays are already engaged in the hotel, near the central in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the recent Hotel Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, because we are about 60 per cent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow, the interest in stays in Krkonoše will increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel.
However, at the moment, it seems that the hotel of Krkonoše they will the appetite of snow waiting.
On Thursday, must fall temperatures and, if there is rain, in the mountains should.
But then again rise temperatures, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, the Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: the repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of a man more intelligent, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, looking forward, it showed that it is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, established three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the "as in Iraq", but did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement: "A New Way Forward".
It was he, who three years ago, Bush criticized the idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today we are not talking about Iraq in the news.
The reputation of Bush did not improve, however objectively left to his successor an initial situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
The captains of Field returned to ask him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley Mccristal. He, even though the traditional subordinate relations, submitted to the undecided in the White House to a harsh criticism.
Asked 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but it was nothing better, so at least misled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
Managed to get Europe promised another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the whole strategy of Obama seems to its objective, begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this process in three years. The whole doctrine of Obama generated more questions than answers that offered.
Many doubt that the increase would give the same result that the procedure in Iraq.
In spite of the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organized, its leaders to respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to rely on anyone and there is no agreement.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day, according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village. After he will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to the confused, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even establish a state that is capable of action, "a minimum target for the entire operation, it seems very real.
The horizon of the Obama strategy clashes by his will.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who know nothing of the reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, set the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as a statement of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans have less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, can affect the situation, it is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and sanctions would not have any effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years for the presidential election and that is why there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year's bonuses in cash.
The entity announced to react to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, actions that cannot be sold at a minimum period of five years.
Moreover, the actions may be withdrawn in the event that they had taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the power in the long term.
I suppose that Wall Street is fully aware of the way that must undertake, mentioned the former Banking investor of the entity Douglas Elliott.
The devil is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after (almost $17 billion (almost 300 billion CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters, probably exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bank bonuses for that exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712.000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.

It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also the permanence of Janota in the cabinet, will be the subjects of its meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
On the reported the spokesman of the president Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 million kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, because to increase the budget deficit.
Among the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Because of this conflict, are beginning to be controversial future activities of the cabinet of Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, Čssd and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of measures, imposed in the autumn by the government of Fischer to curb the public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long neglected "a serious problem", that is, "the deficit" of public finances.
According to him today do not have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can support a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, the president.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Neas, said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of, ODS and the greens obviously no longer works.
The Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words "strong sentences".
The head of Čssd, Jií Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. surpass $200 million.
On Wednesday Čssd said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The popular were also happy.
Mandela in the new film Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: Invincible, a lot about the country, their fight and their victories, although some critics say that the roles played by the American players.
The history of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, asked him in the film.
Another important role played by Matt Damon.
I said to him: "When I read, I will have to have access to you.
The actor and two years, who received the prize for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of boxing milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, the president of the US, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, it is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their efforts to end apartheid in South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years, became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk as he
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the team of South African rugby, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after the apartheid Their nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that it is capable of uniting his people through sport, and that is why we decided to join the rugby players, who belong in the measure to the world.
The South African team to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela to cinemas.
He had another goal to play this role in such a way that was as close as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the political forces in the same area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I discovered that the hand, receive their energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling to know how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember being on the door, he opened and the first thing that I told FranÃ§ois Pienaar in my life was: "In the film seem much higher".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the players and their real models, and under the management of the Director Eastwood, Invictus: INVINCIBLE received positive reviews and is also talks of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of the magazine Daily Variety McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In the reviews of films on the website rottentomatoes. com, Invictus received a 76 per cent of positive assessments.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians did tests of a missile
On Norway was a special effect of unknown origin.
The Ministry of Defence of ended recognizing yesterday that near the border with Norway made of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, "Bulava", previously designed to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, not flying or there was a fault in the air.
In Russian newspapers write "bulavá" as "a missile that not fly."
A missile that do not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem.
At the end of the flight of new technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke in the third stage of the missile.
This time "bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, floating in the White Sea.
This type of missile launch from a boat that is moving and is at the same time.
It is likely that the light mysterious on Norway, caused by an object, in reality outside the failed "Bulavá."
The Norwegians like from the first moment did not hesitate a Russian missile.
The generals this time are saying that cannot be simply talk of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost 50 per cent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that "bulavá" a day without problems and even will take up to ten blocks hipersónicos nuclear, whose total weight limit is of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed the 51 years an annual contract with CSKA Moscow

Hyundai complied with the requirements of the trade unions. All the extra work
The direction of the car factory in agreed with the unions cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, unions said on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman of the factory of automoviles Hyundai.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a time for Saturday.
We cannot resign ourselves to our plan of manufacture, because it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary extra work for Saturday, 19 December, that is to say, it will work in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the server sedmička. cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 employees who work the turn on Saturday.
The bonus will be paid for last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate their employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or can take a day off on 28 December, that is to say, prolonging a day Christmas festivities mentioned.
In addition, all employees of the shifts of Saturday will receive money for travel and for food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and challenging of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, to stop the production last week, the direction yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned vaněk.
The employees of the factory's cars were forced to work two hours more shifts of eight hours and this situation practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions cancel the emergence of strike.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and trade unionists must be carried out on Monday morning.
The head of the trade unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they pledge to meet the requirements and signed the document, are prepared to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the car factory was compounded last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike by the frequent extra work.
Also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The direction that the employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and to supply the cars.
Trade unionists in his declaration of emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, were penalised in any way.
With regard to the extra work, the unions are demanding that the company is reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year required for this work remuneration of 5,000.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai now has 2,000 employees.
The series was launched last November.
Until last September manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: a substance effective until in the Encallecidos' HIV virus
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans is evidence of new compounds capable of holding the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance improved is the fact that it is also effective against the virus resistant to medicines.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely removed, will create the so-called resistant virus; against them, no longer work medicines.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility to dominate the resistance of the virus.
They showed that the substances called metalocarboranos have an effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The Metalocarboranos are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way to all drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In its Work scientists are new, improved compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the of the virus.
The Metalocarboranos have a three-dimensional structure: two cages composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case by Cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient
The proteasis HIV is a of the HIV virus, and it is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and not create mature and infectious corpúsculos of the virus.
If we stop the proteasis HIV, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explained in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short series, which continues to be amended.
A little weaker, but more effective
The evidence of the effect of this series of substances against Proteasis HIV was conducted in test-tube, and also against their variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the Metalocarboranos in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in medicines used, however not lose their effect on the resistant, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities as biological and chemical stability, the low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, the Metalocarboranos are compounds interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular genetica in the academía of science.
For the budget. ods attacked Fischer, he argues
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think its future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the prime minister as sentences.
They say that it is time for analysis.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Neas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to be in the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democración towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposals by the left, by more than 12 billion kronor.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the proposals of ODS, since Cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kronor.
ODS before the vote left the room and the desire of the government, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusion and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in case of adoption of the proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to televize Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
Pointed out, is planning to stay in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to the government have nothing to do the nominated by the Čssd, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister also should clearly say, if you will resign, if the House adopt other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to subsidies in disease, income, or the amendment of the law of Service.
TopolÃ¡nek: the ministers nominated by the ODS are not
It is the subject of Prime Minister Fischer and the government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, stressed in the news of the US.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit in the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
But it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with this, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by members of ODS.
The Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS gave at the request of the prime minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies likely to vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly calls to members of ODS to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel as orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, If ODS is not concerned by the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I realized that my vote.
The resignation of the mandate knew that, in the following months they were especially bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek.

The total length of the traffic will be reduced by two percent compared with the day after the new timetable of trains comes into force.
The majority of charges including the basic price and customer will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line added Unacarretería Pendolino.

This is the 15. line of the system, on the outskirts of cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the Line of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
The links to long distances to the capital will end up in the station Prague Hlavní Nádraží.
Čd will introduce more links Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to / Jeseník move every two hours.
From the 13 December travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account by the regional rail this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called losses demonstrable dráhy will receive the next year four billion kronor in total, like this year. Local trains are responsible for the regions, the next year will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the Regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast trains and local dráhy have a new contract for ten years, until now the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why did not increase the price of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will occur only in tickets a day - D net and cheap tickets on the Internet eliška.
For travelers without card customer the price net increase of 450 to 600.
The price of will depend on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two cities.

The history of RSA concerns around the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days in American cinemas a new Hollywood movie, Clint Eastwood Invictus (His official title in Czech Esinvictus: NeporaÅ¾enÃ½), which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the Republic of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of the globally known fighter against apartheid, plays Morgan Freeman, who chose years ago for the leading role the Mandela.
The second paper, the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, interpreted Matt Damon.
With the born of the reactions of the critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. was born on 18 July 1918 in MVEZO, South Africa.
In 1988 she received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993, with the de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.

Great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when the Republic of South Africa in preparations for the World Cup in football. At the same time the media are by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants of the dominant black majority.
According to the news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of roles for the "interesting" Hollywood Stars.
Morgan Freeman however said, he is proud of the film.
For many years he dreamed of the role and I am prepared to play it well.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as they say - charge its energy, said in an interview after the festive holiday in Los Angeles.
I think it is good, whether through the film we can remember the man and the message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, perose concerns around the world, he added.

The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated in the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game was born the nation. portrays the South African lawyer of human rights during his first presidential election.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, and for long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was also puts the team of South African national rugby and falls to the field. RSA won at that time the World Cup.
By entering the Gramilla in the costume, which is seen as something almost sacred, Mandela Fourteen years ago won sustained applause, especially of the public white and the recognition of the white people.
The football World Cup will help people to unite and form a nation, mentioned the Rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Still will be, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as he said, for example in an interview recently for an amateur rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.

Jančura will submit a complaint for slander to three hetmánes of Čssd
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will submit a complaint for slander to three hetmánes socialdemocráticos.
It is in the region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko martínek of Pardubický kraj and hetmán of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Mentioned in 20 minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended up signing contracts to the long term with eské dráhy.
All three Hetmánes are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are taking the "of the cake", however brought only the supply for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than eské dráhy, which is not true. We know the price of eské dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have something else to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards Society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
At the same time have the evidence of all regions. According to him have not taken necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
HAšEK considers this complaint by the continuation of the show of Mr Jančura, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmánes to do so also.
I suppose, that on this occasion it will show clearly that Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and false, mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures of the regions.
To Radiožurnál told, that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
, that the campaign will be carried out against the corupción as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the Regions were agreed with eské dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the job of approximately 150 billion kronor not an aim.
According to Jančura Similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of, owing to his criticism of transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we leave, we will lose the licences of buses.
It was presented as a member of, I know, what Mr is, I am not going to say his name, said Jančura today to radiožurnál.
The vaccine Neumococal will be free and voluntary
The vaccine Neumococal from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However already appear views, that the vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against culminate.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January will be able to receive the vaccine Neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, you have to cover other doses of the vaccine also.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and the fifth month of age of child.
Last year, a quarter of the families left voluntarily to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Parents however paid for a dose 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children needed four doses.
Experts estimate that insurance companies will spend in vaccines from 300 to 450 000 annually.
However save in the treatment, which is needed for children are not vaccinated.
Until now, the state spent by the vaccination of children around 500 000 annually.
The vaccination cover was initiated by the so-called package of Janota.
The NEUMOCOCO is the cause of the otitis media, but also of the serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
The neumococales infections in our country die each year, according to the research in the hospitals 28 children not over the 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic the neumócocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be compulsory in future.
From January must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The vaccine would be better, for example, Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their partnership spreads vaccines neumococales already long ago.
The experts at an international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we now have to undertake, mentioned kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against neumococos.
At the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, say doctors
The president of the Society of Pediatricians ODBORNá SPOLEčNOST PRAKTICKýCH DěTSKýCH LéKAřů CABRNOCHOVá recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they may think about the reduction of the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs a amount so high, relatively understand the political decision to initiating vaccination as a voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents leaves vaccinate against their babies.
The vaccine Neumococal is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by the health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on the prophylaxis, to save then in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
However the pediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members however were afraid, that insurance companies could "take the money on health insurance."
Doctors will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have asked to ban the construction of minarets and that there is a general warning about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims (which in fact are integrating) in one of the most secular societies of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the latest work from the author why the French do not like the Veils "(" why the French don't like headcarves ") (2006), a study and elegant argued for a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what they are saying politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen called Islamic spaces. "
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that to them.
Should a Muslim marriage in a mosque or in a city (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims on the evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim uses a banking system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These issues are seemingly mundane, argues, things of daily life, that concern the means more than the political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and scholar Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to spread this argument completely.
The Conservatives doubt just the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But the adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Question the extent to which policymakers French (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims are probably more unfair that Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments with the secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say yes, but not yet. "
The most devastating picture of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat on the planet.
Defines the ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking the life that cannot survive in any other way.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been approached in the waters recently opened, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
IN ON Thin Ice "(" On Thin Ice ") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of the, describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value to the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson as a courageous in 14 years, fighting only with the end of its foot, is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The offspring, captured while following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the twentieth century, 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the premises of zoos are still generally a part of the area of the scope of an adult wild. The climate is almost never appropriate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was green algae that grow within the areas without of its stripe.

Ellis to stories of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters to the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Eskimos in motonieves use assault rifles of high power to down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two nations where the ice will last for longer.
In his new book, after the ice "(" The Ice "), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling tale about the science of the Arctic and a look of how we can transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists nor can adequately explain the speed of the change.
It is not for lack of effort.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and early twentieth century gave evidence for the first time about the movement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines in the Cold War drew up a map of the Movedizos cordons of ice under the masses of ice.
The satellite and the extensive series of probes in the Icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals resistant camped out in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by chorritos of water that while freezes.
But since the bear in the microscopic surface until the wonders of the Interior, are all condemned once the ice in summer withdrawn, which it believes can happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, ... These could be us
Marines among the 6,000 that placed wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Pfc. De'angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N. C., to the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like to see someone do the same for me, therefore only try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Company of Worcester in Harrington, Maine, opened the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey each year in different cities along the way, for events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of the cemetery in Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the cemetery national Fayetteville in Arkansas, of the Battery Park in New York City and the memorial site for the Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a military career.
While her husband is buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It is like visiting a grave of family.
Wrapped in layers of warm, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves of the First World War, the Second World War II and the Vietnam War, because they do not so many visits as the new graves, said the organizers.
The atmosphere was, while the children were playing and couples were taken in hand, while wearing the fresh pine to the Sepulcrales.
Each move was a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, the section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and the families and friends supported each other in the air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small white and black plates placed within the mud, for those whose who have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who enjugaban tears in their eyes in front of the grave of her son.
Handled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone can remember."
Cuban official arrested a contractor of the US government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government to mobile and portable computers in the country, said on Saturday the officials of the State Department.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the Agency for International Development of the United States and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, but according to the law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
The anti-government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a rapprochement "slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobile and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new products and in a country where the average salary of a worker of government is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, since a telephone conversation 15 minutes would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and at some establishment of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Glory Berbena, official press in the US Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, as mobile free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas Program for Human Rights Watch, which recently published a scathing report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "new Castro, Cuba," a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials desenmarañan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they expect that the case will help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who on the Internet in search of young.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led to men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, the isolated for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the mountains of the Northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They are considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason, were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not inmutaron and even were trying to get the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when the police the Pakistani authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has as top priority to try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The organization act as guards, not leaving those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Al Qaeda analyses with special attention to the American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to its potential to gain access to American objectives and due to its propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
It has been transformed into a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here demanding the negotiators who work in the centre of conventions beautiful center of the city, bolder actions to the climate.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
In a day in which little happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists have walked through the city holding banners in English, saying "there is no Planet B" and one in Spanish that, "Land said" Enough is enough ".
Several famous joined the protest, even the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the homeland of his mother, made me aware of the issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding, said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way for any longer.
The police prevented the protesters too at the Bella Center, and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or carrying of pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because they were involved in the discussions on the climate, some activists with masks and black dresses placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that began as llamaradas, but which were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
In the convention centre, people gathered around television screens to look at the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not to penetrate the awareness of key officials as Su Wei, chief negotiator of China on climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact in international deliberations, he replied in English, "really was not aware of the situation."
Then followed by saying in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is great, I can hear what is happening outside."
He said that depended on the prospect of each define if progress was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "It can also be said that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal ratings last week on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools in the district capital.
Although the district is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the report card showed that students in fourth and eighth grade gave strides at a faster pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between students African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in fourth grade of the D.C. during the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their peers African-Americans rose only three points, 209 to 212.
In fact, the difference in yield grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant, 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The gap that separated between white and black fourth degree in 2003, when it released the first enpe in the district, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the district expressed concern last week, since the advances held by the Chancellor Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven in large part by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole response to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates the educational equity in the district.
I am not giving of joy by a difference of two or three points, said the council member of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (.-For accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of the Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the scores of proof is that the secondary schools in the city have a desperate need of attention.
Clearly is always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not spending the time or the energy needed for our schools.
Rhee said the district needs to find better ways to address the needs of students from low.
This autumn, for example, is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the system of reading Wilson, targeting students in the higher grades of primary school and middle, which dominated the fundamentals of reading early in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real life experiences, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which is something of the progress reported by the Enpe last week.
But I think that we have to continue working to offer the best speeches to those students who are below the level of degree, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the Enpe highlighted the issue of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for schools low, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here there is a sort of dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of the conventional policy is to its resources and reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political implications that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she is clinging to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access to an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is extending the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
To reach nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which it regards as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
To make higher education a part of any future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong.
Rodríguez, 12 years, fell and blinked during a moment before the white columns, the facades of brick and meadows.
The parents of had barely graduated in a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, had never set foot in a university campus.
Still, when she and the other pupils of eighth grade of the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs 38.690 dollars a year, its attitude was less of guests impressed that the potential of students.
Yes! Here is where I am! he exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
Goodness, seriously?, said, when the guide spoke of the low proportion profesor-of school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited during his trip three days, and had already absorbed completely its deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to university.
The question is to what.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants out of secondary school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who enter the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" is graded at the university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finish secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because the way to a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who look to higher yielding say that often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes can also play a unique role to help Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Noting of low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined to students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour of the universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement the programmes of university, which start when students from low-are in middle school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent visiting the university, according to the Department of Education of the United States.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns by violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, for two auctions which ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi ministry of oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are having pujado in only two of the 10 sites.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements to auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum of oil from Iraq, a centre of online news.
It will be a long time before something more is on offer in Iraq.
The security concerns, by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while the American military withdrawn, probably prevented the American oil companies to risk more strongly in Iraq, which is the third most important of oil in the world, said analysts.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have significantly lower labour costs and are more prone to take risks because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, in more contracts than any other company and achieved major investments in contracts for two main fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic power and technology, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We have confidence that the company will be on a par with their competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies to submit proposals made offers that then with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each field.
The chief planner of al Qaeda has been apparently murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a US missile attack in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a top al Qaeda operations planner of this week, said on Friday of the counter-terrorism officials.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles against his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to sources American and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were fired by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA in the tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The official said that local militants suspected were rushed to the scene and quickly seized what was left of the "bodies completely wrecked."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two officials of the American counter-terrorism cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner of al Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the region of Afghanistan.
Was devoted to conspiring throughout the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspirativos attacks against the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guidance of the senior command of al Qaeda and translated into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat that came to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking officers.
The pace of attacks by aircraft operated by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations a month to two, according to a count by the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non-profit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to improved by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly suspected informers, said the site.
The top UN envoy in Kabul to surrender
The United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he give up his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan backed by the UN.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the American timetable for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and to send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can rely on the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, to work with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector needs to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, spending only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to notify the Secretary
The UN General Ban Ki-moon, so they had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering to Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently addressed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested before his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to promote the President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was sacked, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was as much scepticism about the international interference" in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the efforts by the forces led by the United States in Afghanistan.
It also prompted the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff in the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limits of their powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the regulations cumbersome recruitment of the UN undermine their ability to attract talent.
It is so that the rules of the UN me to recruit only one person since May, said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
GATES: Iran will face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, said Friday that the world powers will soon "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, he dismissed the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that worries me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions on the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian people in general.
He argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons," because "its people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement of the White House, spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences "credible" if its nuclear programme is not fully respecting the recommendations of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that it would negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and agree to make a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for an agreement, as a way of building trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided in connection with the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options, including continue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations on Thursday denounced what he called the "unfounded accusations and without basis, on the part of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers," in order to achieve an appropriate solution, in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington on last Friday, was found in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq's oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in the projects in the United States, to reduce the number of American troops 000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about the reduction pending. American officials cited the words of gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the regional government of Kurdistan: "its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
Do not abandon them. "
In a China that ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda that the sermoneaban on the fact that "the mother earth is too tired to sustain more children" and a baby means a grave more. "
Learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of their city, changed course suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more of a child, the reaction was instant and firm: in any way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing for a second, said Wang, 31, a manager of human resources with a child of eight months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously rechonchos, children only, apodados "little emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy was effective, according to the division
Demographic of the UN, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and more of 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with populations of highly educated, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Family Planning Commission and Shanghai Municipal Population, has said that the fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of aging people and alleviate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the one-child policy of China is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid a critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have abortions according to the sex of the foetus, leading to a high innatural proportion male-female.
In recent years, the demographic officials have gradually softening its position on the policy of only child.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife are only children, and in 2007, many of its hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Institute of Population Research at the university, said that the central government officials have been discussing recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only son.
In July, Shanghai became the first city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight the morning, that the families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be appropriate to have a second child and apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai that noted a moderate increase in applications for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, it is expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu, 26, said that they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But as many Chinese, have only medical insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a network of social protection, they argue, this option would be irresponsible.
People in the West sees incorrectly the policy of only son as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
Is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the Manager of Human Resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: "At the centre of our family and we were accustomed to all of us.
We are not used to care for others and do not really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, the owner of an agency of translations, explained in a more forceful.
For parents with two careers, middle-class, to reduce the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew up watching the fight of their parents during the first days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want this kind of life for themselves, said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time, he argued.
A mother has to give at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, "have to reshape his apartment," and the strategic "must have a curriculum prepared for the best care when the child is 9 months."
Most of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, marked so far by offensive positions and mutual recriminations, a renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that provides for ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations to carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step in the negotiation, which is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders come to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc Working Group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money would the rich to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies recortarían its production of coal, and what would be the limit of the global increase in temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the document of six pages, summed up a text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
The profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations collectively their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45%, compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries the emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion dollars annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday was presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that call for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries move forward and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei, said that the maximum climate of United States lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the major powers of the world at stake, the fault lines have eruption both within the developing world, as between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies as to save the planet, with China and the United States face on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the four countries of the world are ignoring the most influential scientific imperative to take action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will be at best a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, drew up a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island nations has "put political pressure on the political process," in part because they are now consolidated and demand action from the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
The high-level officials, as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy minister, fell from the aircraft and ran to the corridors of the Bella Center, behind closed doors meetings and press conferences, in order to determine the claims that during the next week.
The absolute disarray of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people in and out of the centre of convention, the activists who play the guitar present night mockery of the countries that they are selling, and spend preliminary proposals hand in hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only built: Almost all the key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 kmh of Great Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
The 5.13 On Monday morning, a perforará darkness to point to a way out of the train that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed intercity train the country will reach 225 kmh, when it came as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, to the station St Panrcas in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, then the lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first intercity service javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service linking Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connects the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, The Times of business travel would be shortened and the change of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national emissions of coal, as well as relieve congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still stop the high-speed lines in Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to The Times.
This will provide a detailed map of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be fleshed out within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
It is also expected to establish three options for a high-speed network broader than to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favoured option is being proposed is a configuration with form, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west from the peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another in the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
It seems that this will be the most beneficial, "said a member of the railways.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which did not before 2025, would allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with the little more than an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, turning the British network in the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to withstand trains 400 Mt of length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of London-Birmingham.
This means that would be a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions of area of the capital, is expected to extend an existing station to conform to the high-speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only the station St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis announced whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that there will not be a final decision until after a general election.
Even if the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
The It would force the trains to stop the Rapid lines by existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland over the three hours.
This is viewed as a crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage by a £75, 000 of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman of the Conservative Party, he charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Naranjal that built the house in his constituency.

The authorities in the House of Commons approved applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of the expenses of members. Last night Mr Duncan said that applications could not be clearer or more simple. "
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, has a house of two flats in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed with Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year added a greenhouse to the home, described the plans as a "Naranjal."
Neighbors described it as a greenhouse for entertainment ".
He was not asked Mr Duncan to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on their previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the Committee of violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of pounds of their property from London to the home of his constituency, which he bought in 1991, the previous year to become a member.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was £1, 400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications rose to more than £1, 800 per month.

And could ask for much more, but I am not. "
The member, a millionaire from his former profession as oil trader, was questioned in the first place on their expenses in May, when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the office of wages that this could be considered excessive ".
An activist dug a hole in the form of the symbol of the pound sterling in the lawn of Mr Duncan in protest, after revealing that requested 4,000 pounds over three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase of the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: It was for improvements, both by the office of wages and subsequently by Legg. "
He added: "This is to evade and commit crimes or INFRINJIR rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the Rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be any clearer or more simple. "

Late payments: anger among the prison guards, is expected to take actions
The unions for prison guards on Friday to a "general mobilization" to demand the payment before the end of year, premiums and the overtime, which was postponed until Eneropor budgetary reasons.
The Force union prison guards (2) asked the staff of service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning off the prisons and "block" to report the theft of their assets.

The direction of the prison administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of guards guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the direction of the prison administration immediately implement a series of measures designed to this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime not occur in the future.
The pay of December will then be limited, except for the staff of the direction that enjoys the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and that "always the blame budgetary constraints," deplored the UFAP / UNSA.

But in any case, the result is not expected, said the secretary-general of the UFAP, Jean-François forget.
For Christmas, Obama said that "best gifts" that receives
The US president, Barack Obama, which would mark its first Christmas in family in the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion to gifts: "I better gifts that I get."
During a special interview that the chain ABC issue on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the New Year celebrations in his new and prestigious residence.

The son of singer, relaxed, assured that would move "quickly" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday joined on Monday by an infection resulting from the hernia operation discal on 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to prevent suffering and to be able to administer their treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors of the hospital cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where he on Monday by an infection, the sequel of a discal hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was operated on again the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous speaker.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French of Los Angeles, attended her daughter Jade, to witness a School Act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The head of surgery and of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer accused of violent to Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurocirujano that operated the singer on 26 November in the international private clinic Monceau Park, in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, declared Camus.
There is talk of a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "gone too fast to Los Angeles with the authorisation of the surgeon."
I spoke directly with the doctor and I was surprised when I was told that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated on twice for discal hernia, added.
Shortly before the broadcaster RTL, indicated that the singer had "gone without team, without anything," after his operation of Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
The actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, also spoke to the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg for a hematoma formed as a result of a brain haemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by Justice on several occasions by Malapraxis, as also for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" defendant "regularly" before the Council of the order, and is "far from being desirable."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David.
This indicated that the speech "was made without any problem" and that the results of the studies were "normal".
The operation "could not provocarhemorragias and, not needed drainage," added.
Either way, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered into a parenthesis.
Without doubt, to return to the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I think it is very risky, declared Camus.
The association lifts the tone and warns the new centre on the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the modem () Democratic Movement of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday before the attempt by the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (takeover bid) on the acronym of the former party giscardista, intimándole to withdraw all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to regain the acronym UDF, because it considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend its political heritage after reaching out to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is linked to the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the.
As support for its management, received the support of the member Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the brand, it was the first in the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the Office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou, who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a call to the Minister and the Member Intimándolos to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, on pain of legal proceedings.
These last few days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose to his political movement to restore the acronym UDF, writes the partnership in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle De Sarnez of the modem, as Senator Jean Athuis the centrist alliance.
Also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the + focus +, and the slogan + L' + in its militant material and the home page of its Web site, argue the signatories of the letter.
As we know, have no right to use the acronym, explains the Office of the UDF requires that the withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as well as of (his) Internet site."
Also on Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) marks the legitimate."
To do so, will return to the court to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends' chose' leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as they had done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the new centre, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, "when he registered the trademark", it was no longer a member of the UDF for three years, "but of the UMP.
Of scandalous and the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on their own.
This indiscretion is transformed into crime, before a mockery of the strategy of the A: "We believe that in politics, as in life, is more worthy made his own name to try to get out of anonymity taking a name that is not right."

In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
Since their wedding, never again able to speak with Françoise ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre, once again, that the complainant was not in a position to appear, so much so that a judge of refused, in recent days, to grant their request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, not under the supervision and has no guardian.
No other person may appear in their place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that once the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Does managerial revolution or end of the intelligence business?
If nothing changes in the management of big French companies, our fight for the development of the intelligence of business will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the leadership of large companies with regard to their employees recalled the position of companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of the marketing: it is that the partners to "values" Certain from above as before it was imposing on the consumer products designed for the technical factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution of marketing gave place to the strategies of conquest of the markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the factors of preference for customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly executives.
This demobilization committed serious development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of the R &amp; D and, even more, the intelligence of business.
Indeed, the BI (business intelligence) "demands that all the parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it needs of employees a compromise that is totally opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we invited a managerial revolution, which would be the staff in the centre of the concerns of the company as the customer.
Opinion polls have a relative utility
Did the domestic opinion polls, as the questionnaire by orange among their employees, to the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially ... What always made!
The second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- Finally, because the majority of managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from large schools of Engineers, interpret the psychology way.
Take, for intellectual, the former behavioral theory that the "American" Americans recently, and that the institutes of studies and the media largely behind their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "Commandos" (sic) of the commitment of the executive, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. fr reaffirms the managers in a position of management, unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, is taking a specific vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating all reasoning or practice of business management, a basic fact: For employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the analysis take this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a Doxa that allows them, through the image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own projects of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the factors of mobilization, managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate its "social performance" and the management derecursos human "in the place."
In this way, create a breeding ground for the development of a strong and effective Business Intelligence.
Oslo speech: the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American Right, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the of the prize to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate for the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, leading figure of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she had addressed the issue of the war is sometimes necessary "in his recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, the war is, of course, the last thing that the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists, he observed.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was spent, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was very well, the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which appreciated in particular the mention of "The existence of evil in the world," in the words presidential.
At times, the speech I was very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program "The Takeaway."
The former elected representative, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential elections in 2012, was pleased to hear from "A president of the left" when reminded the members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a speech very American."
In addition to stand as a "citizen of the world", as it always does, "" spoke as an American president "to remind the Europeans" living in a bubble of security that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it, "said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk in the era of Bush, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the Internet site of National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent, he warned.
However, the press centre left praised the president.
Los Angeles time, although still believe that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, described his speech "overproduction" Especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented the Californian newspaper.
Obama "delivered the speech that was necessary," the New York Times, "at the time of bleak and uplifting."
Transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations, the the trade unions of roads and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only organization employers who stayed until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
During the session of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "happy" with the agreement, after several sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were dismissed at dawn on Friday, with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, Otre) left by the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 h was necessary for all agree and the text is firm to the 18 h.
The conflict "has been very damaging for business" and "It was feared that disrupt the New Year celebrations," said Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in the Road Transport, Local and Regional), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The rate per hour of 72 9, 06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice (FO).
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some rebel, added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to higher wages, bearing in mind international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects the employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) is recognized as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extra payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a low of 100 million euros in charges employers' was the subject of an amendment to the government in the law of finance for 2009, the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement is implemented, firstly, to stuck to this organization and, secondly, the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Work do an extension.
It will be "as soon as possible," assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR complained that it was a "business of naive," as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as conclusion to an analysis by the parties, but not to those who want to eat turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner, regretted the UNOSTRA.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months."
RER: conflicts over the weekend, unions with the proposals of the
The conflicts in the RER, the largest urban public transport in France, are going to continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2 nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to his request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only trains between the 10 h and the 20 h, at a rate of a train of every two in the central section (between and nation) and a train of four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the snfc will be suspended in Nanterre préfecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy "The RATP strive to provide service to the big tent."
The RER A crosses from west to east of the city of Paris.
The route runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
This Friday, roughly one in two trains at peak hours, and almost no train in hours Valley, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the platforms thanks to the Organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at the dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29 years engineer, explained that it had been lifted, "an hour and a half earlier to reach".
The station Saint-Lazare not, indicated the SNCF, which had for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A the SNCF operates from Cergy-le-haut or for this arrived or departed from the station Saint-Lazare to join the metres.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. will be analysed the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the trade unions, a meeting that took place with the direction on Friday afternoon.
The director of the proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want drivers who demand a premium owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP puts even in parentheses its premium, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the direction "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the roads had already resolved."
It is for a new meeting on Monday to make "a more detailed analysis on the conditions for the exercise of the profession," the RATP.
It also led to the trade unions to say that the company "did not for users of the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters, in Paris.
Then the direction, which refused until then to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could spread to the B on Tuesday, after the UNSA and indépendants have filed a notice.
The unions are calling for a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150, of which 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, SUD, indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million passengers per day.
The drivers of RER, all in the second stage of his career, charge of 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros premiums, for hours with shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolved the ruling party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the main party of the country, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of the government, which has just lend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he declared to the press, the president of the court, Hasim, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, though only needed a majority of seven votes to get the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the leaders of the party, including its president Ahmet Türk and Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that members of parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision comes in the wake of a procedure that launched the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the rebels of the PKK.
However, the party claims that it has "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the court intervenes at the time in the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community to a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a break-up could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south-east Anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, degenerated into clashes with the police during the last few weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the main city of south-east populated mostly by Kurds.
The forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators throwing Molotov bombs or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, also concentrated around 100 people.
After the verdict, stated that the decision of Justice to "deepen the despondency."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) dissolving a Party, told the press.
The government, formed by a Party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, the Minister of Energy, Yildiz.
This Decision boycotts completely the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction of the PKK, added.
This Thursday, the PKK was an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks of the past few months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to the Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded secret research of weapons.
Today, the community of inhabitants, situated at 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "silicon valley".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the headquarters of scientific riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the center of innovation in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were a number of mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a "protocol of close collaboration".
The vice-mayor and the mayor of Rosljak Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In the 2010 will travel to a seminar in the selenogrado representatives and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Research Centre of Natural Sciences.
Scientific exchange
It is a scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The Fiz companies will have the possibility to put one foot in the Russian market.
In exchange the Russian scientific want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies and rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of socialist planning" for research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of mountains, which settled research facilities.
Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not sufficiently high places for nothing.
For supporters of the project is purely and simply as "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which plunged to the capital of the region of Banden-württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
With terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time of Engineering of the nineteenth century, acting as brakes of a modern rail traffic, was formerly needed an enormous amount of time to locomotives back ahead.
Rolling, stopped in their tracks to continue the journey; but it should be done.
And that is why should disappear terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station step, which is approximately half of the journey of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 really will be initiated, despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Bavarian capital Hessiana and is almost unpayable implement the reduction.
Rail terminals, of course, have more problems of entry and exit, since there are locomotives reversible with tractora unity and CART driver at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 including the new tranche built ice towards Ulm will be initiated.
Federal and local politicians have prepared as well.
The Rail continues, also because the risks of large individual projects in the infrastructure of the Republic of the taxpayer, not the state.
From the point of view of houses, the project still justified up to a point.
It creates new urban space, with many green areas, probably of the graphic generated by computer the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The station step and the road are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time did not the competition from low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first work to strengthen the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more than that made by lorries on the roads.
However, the new sections in construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
In total sixty projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 is built the route to slow.
It would be urgent here on the accelerator properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the autonomous parliament in Wiesbaden, whether to lodge an appeal against the ruling on the Prohibition of night flights of the Administrative Court of Hesse.
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned experts legal research of the judgment of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had informed in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the runway-west planned at the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as for the federal government, would not be compatible with the legal protection of the population of the noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, whether it is going to present an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the representatives of the government for the appeal to the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the group SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises to ban air traffic at night, who had carried out before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of floor.
It is quite difficult, if you let him keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We keep our word."
The minister Posch rejected the of Schäfer-gümbel, that the federal government would be trying to through distortions of the law and tricks still get their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition did not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As well as the opposition, would not have never been of his group on the Prohibition of night air traffic.
The US banks back aid.
The big American banks hit by the crisis of its shackles.
"Bank of America" returned at once the aid that he had paid the bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 million euros).
And also the group plans to repay state aid, according to a report by the United States.
With this the institutes are to free themselves from restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of the bonus to managers, as well as the payment of high rates.
"Bank of America" had secured about 19 billion of money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum taken from the box, which had enough resources, including by the sale of items.
The banking director Kenneth Lewis welcomed on Wednesday night especially American taxpayers: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The group also aims to get money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported source of known circles, that the American bank could announce already for this Thursday increased its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the group declined to comment.
In June had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Rapid election
In the end, was faster than was thought.
Barely two weeks after the Administrative Council of the German television channel ZDF () The editor-in-chief of Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the study principaldel in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it also had the further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal will not be adopted in the Administrative Board.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Council.
The result of the vote was not yet specified the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago schächter failed in the Administrative Council with its proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against it. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
For most of the Union in the Administrative Council already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the government of Hesse, the Sr. Roland Koch.
Declined another mandate of the editor-in-chief of prestigious with the argument, under the leadership of Brender news of ZDF would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, until they had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which described the Act as unconstitutional.
But it did not.
About The Person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
Having worked in the station "SüDWESTFUNK" and "in the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau."
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle the "Heute-Journal."

The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the dismissal of Brender, which was elected this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the magazine of medium "magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the Administrative Council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way, that the proposals of the Director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the control of the ZDF was ruled by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Mr Peter Frey, recommended to the Administrative Council with a smart move: criticized the guild by the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence Both schächter could name for the post of chief of in without losing face, as the Administrative Council could vote, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a thing.
In the calculations of the Parties Frey is awarded to the liberal left.
The university are
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated States finally relented. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of and masters.
Students in future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: Basically each module of the race to finish with a single review.
In addition to examine the workload of students, and we want to ensure a "real and justifiable."
The policy and the universities want to simplify the recognition of the results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The states are committed to draw more flexible rules set for of structural bachelor and masters.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Less
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the presidents of universities talk constantly about the power to undertake and conclude with a successful career (ESTUDIABILIDAD).
Now for the first time there was talk of a content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of tests: "Each module ends with a one consideration," said in a document 30 pages, which aims to regulate the approval of the university.
With the "significant reduction in the burden of examinations" is intended to prevent the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the estudiabilidad, explained the director of the Council of Accreditation, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future, "Estudiabilidad" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
The courses.
The students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage the own initiative."
These rules resort for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "reacreditar" once every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be the whole country 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Accreditation Council, which was installed by the Länder.
The ministers of education and culture urged the Federal States in October influence in such a way in the agencies, that the number of subjects and the reviews are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder universities and technical schools already reached agreement with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Renania-Platinada assured provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna Process.
With this money universities must implement mentoring programs and student advice, as well as strengthen offices of examinations and from outside.
The state and the universities aim to have 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of the university law.
As it should be enough only one examination for the completion of a model of career.
The shape of the race should be made more flexible, it also wants to ensure the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate the accessibility to the Masters.
Until the end of next year is intended to examine all the about its "estudiabilidad."
On Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of study in the federal state.
Part of the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
In the board at the federal level of the university groups Juso (Young Socialists), that the shape of education policy is no longer should be "behind closed doors" of the ministers and the University Rectors.
At the latest after the strikes of Education, now students as the main involved should have their say.
The president of the board of university (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave its support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK deliberated on a joint document for reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) The Bonn agreements were not quite enough: The union demands a legal right for each student with the title of the possibility of access to a later.
The states have to ensure that the current generation of students from bachelor exist in a future enough places of study for master with the best possible conditions to study. It reported a member of the GEW, Mr Andreas Keller.
The states have a significantly more teachers.
But about greater access to the Masters, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Come and Go of Germany is virtually control," said the first line of a poem by the Werner Söllner in fragments of language, in which Tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany by a dissident, who won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a publisher of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
To söllner gave him a number of prizes for literature, in 1993 the memorable lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since El2002 is director of the Forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the Mirror and The Mirror disfigured their files"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Securitate secret service of fellow writers-Rumanos, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
Attempts to recruitment had started slowly, beginning in 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who is not sufficiently defended against attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate", ended Söllner.
The lyrical is im Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and his literary without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, shaking the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors of Romania for a case that illustrates the chasms and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, by what is known so far, is not only a perpetrator but a victim.
In his dossier of IM Walter had played a role, said the scientist literary Michael Markel after the confession of, and stressed the positive influence for him delim Walter.
He had apologised or defended in all the difficult points for him, said.
"I feel the need to make this statement," he said.
The Declaration of Söllner in this way and in the face of this public was unexpected, the confession of a ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Securitate-spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", having read his own dossier of pages.
Those involved have speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the deal with the issues of control by the Securitate is still quite vague.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather.
Since 2005, there is a law governing the administration of the files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the recipient.
"She has psychosis," In the end only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions arise with the case, as so often when there is blame.
Why right now? Who caused damage? The reaction of the listeners in the confession of söllner leaves hoped that the continuation of this story will be guided more by the desire of knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, took a taxi Mercedes Class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the Foreign Service elegantly dressed was emerging from a very nice celebration of Christmas, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man in the feature had hired a driver, because we still do not know the city.
Moreover, it would also have been able to drive the car himself: At the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was Joy man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reached the end of", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, but we cannot allow ourselves to be blinded by the success: we will have to fight against the decline brutally. "
"task much more important I expected the next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in the success of the real classes "in everyday life in the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the three goals of Marica (5), träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).

The final of the Champions League (parties of the 16/17 and 23/24 February / parties back 9 / 10 and 16/17 March) Sortearán on 18 December in Nyon.
So it remained limited the joy at the entrance of the successor.
Not only in the alleged savior, in short time had inspired the bewildered Profis Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on its strengths, I urged to be more fired, explained the of souls gross its recipe for success that sounds simple, but with the Babbel already had not had the desired effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, when in football there is a new impetus, sometimes things that had not been thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after a pause of several weeks due to an injury advanced quickly to become the best player local thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon "with the proverbial Wind" and the way of work of the new head: He is a man who in depth, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And that is what has been missing, of course, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sporting Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all record.
As Gross, also the players and the manager refrained from overstate the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of relay and totally of Romanian guests.
Also had won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 had reached the sad, gave to think Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in its headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated in the form of a television interview, released just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, faced Heldt the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change coach by the pressure of the fanatics teenagers.
Also had removed his day after the Games described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements of were marked by the pure selfishness, "Heldt, and announced for the zaguero.
Probably will no longer be friends forever, the two cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the others in that, without previous efforts with the team of the coach replaced, would not have been possible the spectacle of great strength of game and battle.
Babbel and their assistants had an important part in the success, "said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also the man in the suitcase of plastic.
Of the World Cup of heavyweights
Ardent mourning in Bern: Time and again the Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its title of heavyweight in the version of the WBC.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
HAMBURG: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the association WBC expired in the night from Friday to Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the noqueo that everyone had hoped for.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be overcome because of their injuries.
The Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before a 17000 spectators in the arena of Berne, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches lower, before the mourning had proclaimed the end of the era Klitschko, was again and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not be decisively to its target its dangerous.
In general terms, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenging, and only tried to move the rounds.
While he was to Klitschko with words and gestures, their blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, 12 rounds complete with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the had already been some scandal in the Swiss capital.
Had insulted Klitschko as "horrible Zombie", which it does not do anything. "
To make the weight, the champion was left to on Friday to take to Johnson glasses of Sun nose be able to see their eyes. "
Fourth triumph following the return of
Also in its fourth row after their return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, in the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "their" of the WBC belt, which previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year later in their defence of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is still collect all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he destronó in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes is planning the fight against Klitschko in the Wembley Stadium, London.
The case
Frontal attack the opposition: The head of the Group of the Greens, JÃ¼rgen Trittin, called liar to the Minister of Defence,, due to false information on the subject Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left require explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin following the most recent revelations about the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor Zu (CSU), have cheated with knowledge of the facts.
IN THE NEWS "Tagesschau" On Saturday, transmitted by the television channel ARD, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister had not told the truth "about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, usually said: He said lies.
The order to kill would have given without taking into account the rules of the international force protection for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that had NATO, and that has read Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, was shown that in this attack was not only to destroy the trucks kidnapped, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack in the United States, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the investigation of NATO, died or were injured to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Saturday for the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to take immediately before the federal Parliament and to clarify what really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's policy of Afghanistan, and if the chancellery, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had transcended misgivings about the presentation by the ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter.
According to information from the Spiegel, both had informed correctly and completely against the background of the attack on the convoy.
Officially it was said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and had concealed details sensitive to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two senior officials, it transpired that they even had pointed to the ministry of defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a patrol of the area.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeiner SonntagsZeitung. "
So far it has not received a response, it was said.
The ministry has not commented on Saturday, with regard to the accusations that he made, and noted that this is in the Committee of Inquiry The Federal Parliament, which will be the next Wednesday.
Worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
It happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can without hindrance to the most wild imaginations and creations of the fantasy.
However, WHO states similar to the dream during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, it is considered the most modern in the western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the.
The blame lies with our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make blurring the boundaries between the dream, the madness and reality.
The states of consciousness ONíRICAMENTE Modified may appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call visions, and at worst madness.
Although it can distinguish the triggers and the effects, it can refer to processes visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, experiences psicodélicas of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, states of possession chamánica, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when it has descarrillado the balance of the neural of communication in the brain especially the dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and Acetilcolina and is disrupted the interaction between different parts of the same.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often appear hallucinations complex and thoughts.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors from the former era.
Aristotle the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, in 1861 a "great resemblance to the state of madness with states oníricos," to Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the absurdities, alocadas formations, and mirages of it".
It is the autumn of 2001, when T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, deformed, rechinando teeth.
We are pursuing, with heavy boots and Flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain in the body.
Voices shrill and malignant resonate from the walls and the radio.
Can no longer, the voices that insult and offend.
T. two cables from the stereo, the Amarra to form a knot of hanged, and fixed in a hook on the ceiling.
You climb in a Bocina and put the noose around the neck.
Jumps.
The rope was.
What you will serve as a lesson!, the voices in a chorus that the eardrums, sees the clinic and do you! "
Now, T. is 40 years old and has undergone six psychosis acute, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of death was the LSD.
His diagnosis is esquizo---paranoid psychosis, is also maniaco-depresivo, takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with the disease, three years ago is married.
In the psychosis experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics are as the second most common disease after the Depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of anxiety that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disruptions in the relationship, or mania.
Especially widespread is the Hearing voices: voices that give orders, or talk.
They are also frequent the hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deep layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the Hospital of General Psychiatry Hospital of the university.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time enters a passive role, as in a dream, is overwhelmed by events and cannot organise actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel reality, the impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial structure and sensory of reality in the psychosis remain in principle as it."
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still unknown why our brains unfortunate mishaps.
According to the states of exception can lead to any person to lose touch with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that in addition to the genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage.
We suspect that the maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains.
But it remains to be seen how this alteration of the neural system, which is not at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role stress or a traumatic experience can be a psychosis when there is already a provision.
In the same way, the hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the system of the brain.
When the brain warms up
The What of all this is that the people suffer with their hallucinations and take medicines very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor in Psychology Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
The perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten collects from ten years ago reports of hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the book Die Welt in unserem (the world unreal in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of the psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, together with mental disorders such as of borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and injuries.
So surprising and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that normally are repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain are processed sensory perceptions are hiperactivas or are little; when our brains hot, but also when there are incentives.
The drugs can cause this state in the same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, the stress, the evil of brain or other states of exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal IM Leben Halluzination Erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and to a college of higher education.
A girl.
If it were not for these images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recess, it happens that a boy clumsy with long hair and dark he runs the floor.
When she replied, the other pupils the soprendidos; no one, part of it, hears or sees the boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoñadora a little odd, but Sarah K. knows that he is not dreaming.
It is surprising and sees and hears that boy, in the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank.
Can feel even their presence, at least a few moments.
It is a feeling, like the boy.
Sometimes wonders whether it is insane.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
The evenings, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When it is in class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because professor in their eyes and ears is introducing a new colleague, while for the rest explains so visible and audible in the mathematical equations.
The evenings, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often arrives late and is scarce, not able to tell whether it is alive or dreaming, if the images we see, the nose or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of their eyes open or closed.
Leave me in peace, shouts to the figures.
Their parents and friends told nothing, that is insane.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. has 20 years.
Approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since he has come in contact through the Internet with the psychologist, knows that he is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that after a time begins to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is YSE charged the same of entertainment.
Sarah K., daughter only, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, he learned that the man he called father since has use of the reason is not his biological father.
Since the noise and visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that process real impressions and noise, those affected as Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, takes place in the brain, the reality is there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, that seem so real. "
Kasten also classifies the Night Fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their views as unrealistic.
Kasten recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation between dream and hallucination
In this world too focused on what is aware, the experiences tend to generally Patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and medical chief of the Hospital Psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic of Florence-Nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful but that also involves something positive and creative the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneirismo, a special form of awareness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The hallucinations are almost dreams are very complex and detailed that the person who the feels real and subsequently cannot differentiate of being awake.
The states aware oníricos arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or disease, as for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropatía, experiencing a paralysis remain completely aware. Die EIB vollem bewusstsein motorische lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a total and permanent disability, it replaces a real situation very dangerous for a world and that is decoupled from reality.
A form of situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in that our own capacity allows us not to sink in nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, of Zurich, described their experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a rescue action of the soul.
Had 49 years, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after an operation of the heart valves with transplant of heart included, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the intensive care.
Claussen descended in a world created by the same and visited places in other times: was lying in a bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot for their health.
It was in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by that produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike was kidnapped in their country of origin, made on his hospital bed in the Alps with firn and encountered a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these facts imaginary, is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these journeys fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the trips are mental, many years later, much more clear, even in the details.
Even more clear and intensive that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience the horizon of the rest of our life experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the Oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile the internal reproduction of reality outside, even when we are awake.
Every amendment of the state of conscience, sums up the psychologist, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Crude
The children will take charge of the editorial with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert crude wants to leave your company in the future in the hands of his two sons, commented to Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
HAMBURG - The publisher Hubert sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and have committed to joining the company, confirmed Gross, 69 years, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are able to do so.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not trained for this.
That would end with the children, and also with the company.
Crude revealed on Thursday that he will retire from January the presidency of the board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed as his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, 52 is since 1999 member of the direction of crude.
A start was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the treasury and with that the responsibility on the heritage of the company. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of the Direct Marketing, the abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family at the top of the editorial.
The children of crude have 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently would have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "bridge the gap of 10, 15 years," according to Gross.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases Schickedanz and schaeffle, Gross said that family businesses are not immune to the decline: "This has always affected families are by the lure of search for capital, which have wrong and thought that they could rise as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur," says Gross.
I do not see it as a politician in this country, as it was, and I do not want to play with the time "in the World League; these businesses have become too big.
The promise of
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail, without even seeing some kind of Deputy or surf the Net.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
See it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a monthly very low, less than half of what is paid by, for example, the data plan for the iPhone.
Given the success the company has brought two new devices: one exclusively designed to Twitter, the other with a free service of data for life in exchange for paying six times more for the peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, about 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or desperately for a bar with WiFi (or a connection of FON) to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming a fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago that would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated of ears of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming charges for the Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
A aparatito as fonpeek (ceases to be curious that bear the name of FON when lacks WiFi) This type of tariffs means that operators are starting to think differently and to study different proposals with which to pay off its network of data.
Kindle is another good example, includes the trafficking of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and bagpipes.
It is a device connected and paid for it to buy it, not month to month.
And that is what I hope to see some day with Fonpeek, an option to purchase with access for life as peek already has in the US.
Not because it to buy it.
I watch my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I believe that it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The colour fetish of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the tone of the first lady.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president with a dress and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has led a model very similar in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar colour - yellow verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress was composed of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same-, and adornaba with a large embroidery or shackles.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the trail of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat vestaurio.
But the question which are the two suits them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fit fat, in Oslo is a velvet with.
The supplements have also changed: Shoes green half the last time, and a similar model, but in Golden, now.
And also different is the hair: A included on this occasion, throwing the previous one.
75% of working mothers has had problems for maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study' fertility and work history of women in Spain', produced by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers saw limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of living in couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they perform.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, working part-time, or have a stable, initiated before the coexistence, in the first pregnancy, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delaying the coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged between 35 and 49 years with permanent work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time of life to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed wields much influence on motherhood although less on the timing of the pairing, "explains the researcher of the Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that distinguishes the age for women to marry and to have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the greater the age at marriage and have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, which have elementary and high school have been mothers for the first time in the middle of 1 and media respectively.
"is also another division between women depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary school, marry and have their first child before getting a stable, the levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to ensuring a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "detailed Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is
L'orÃ©al Paris has just added a new name to its list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become image of various products of the brand, the universal slogan of' because I.
The protagonist of "Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, joins other famous recruits of L'Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before that, the last to join a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto (' Slumdog Millonaire').
In paragraph male, the cosmetics brand also has ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (' Anatomy of grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline colleague in' Lost').
The British Fashion
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their awards, held in London, at the Royal Court justice.
No one to quote.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen best model of the year.
The poker
Manuel away in' Poker of ACeS' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a X-rays of writers who have passed through his literary life (and, in some cases, also on the other).
It does not in the foreseeable and fearsome (biographical, life and work), but looking for something similar to the heart of ignition of the character creator.
The trip has its excitaciones and not save scares or iluminaciones.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and Relecturas.
Here I leave some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without giving name: The Pleasure against the destination, the moral without guilt and innocence without any God."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilistic, Christian, wrote what was in the blood, not the intellect, between the powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic mood, pointless, as the road of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducido by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years, whose meat combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach the sky through the path of doom."
On James Joyce: "The' Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand metres of the universal literature, to be climbed over the wall north, from which it played over and over again the best alpinistas."
On William Faulkner: "It was a rare.
In itself, sometimes said that it was the heir of a landowner in the county and others who was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both were dreams of greatness. "
On Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line: "this writer took up the cry insane thrown from a bridge in Munich to carry its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and did so in a trip away itself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day to its knees and rezÃ³:' God, you do to stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser:' The Dream after the effort, / After the storm the port, / The rest after the war, / After the Life extremely pleased to death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage also their depression.
The husband accepted quite normal that she told that Eduardo VII the among the azaleas or that the birds sing in Greek.
It has never been the case of a man so patient and love of a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness. "
ON PIUS Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos but try to inoculate to Joyce in Baroja?
What tried to benet but move to Baroja by weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela but abducir the reputation of that man to serve as own pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent with her and our dog, a copy of race, rescued the Perrera and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, two kicks that left the dog injured.
Our indignation is because we find the fun in a an aggression to a small animal and helpless, which incidentally, was tied.
To this add the suffocating that led to a lady who was quietly and that, when these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a energúmeno attacks an animal, it is able to do so with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday by a traditionally quiet.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we made a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that serve much and not to generate sensitivities, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider free of charge to a helpless animal that we give love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where they have been good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the hull
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (FESVIAL), has launched a campaign to promote the use of Hull, mainly among the young motorcyclists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection capable of the head injuries or even death in the case of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond design and manufacture products every day" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of Hull in the motorcycle, under the slogan' To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops on motorcycles, with the goal of achieving the maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern "for the company, as being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe.
The sale of Light Commercial
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that were enrolled in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of ANFAC manufacturers and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, not, it should be put in quarantine for the reference to the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a drop of 60% over the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the surge of the last month, the accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the hotchpotch of the light commercial: derived from cars, pick up, light trucks, vans and trucks light / chassis.
Also, have not gone away the clouds that affect their demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
So the restrictions that closed the spigot for bank loans, is in addition to other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Against this background, and unlike cars, have been of little help aid to the purchase of 2000.
To qualify, in addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that go to acquire a commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been.
Yesterday, since Ganvam returned to recall the need to devote special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (lorries and buses).
The Association of Sellers predicts a similar to the year 2010, for which estimates a fall in sales (cars and 4 x4s) of 19%.
The emergency brake is already mandatory
As happened with the blockade of ABS brakes and will proceed with the ESP stability control, brake assist systems of the emergency will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles new registration, while the rest is set for a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians while on his way to work, it can also help prevent many collisions by scope.
The assistant to the emergency brake what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detects the pisotón that gives the driver.
But this does not always maintains that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to slam on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use any force.
To 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum the system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided year to 1.1 fatal accidents in which involved pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one of every four would be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called Intelligent Emergency System.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a house) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it fails to react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises maximum effort to the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that of the new production will begin in the first week of April - the day 8 - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What to Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may make the final document that will be put to workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, delayed until the beginning of 2010.
However, since GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM ADMITS having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but gains strength the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to China BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For desarrolar his last, and expensive jewel, engineers of Porsche took the Boxster S as basis and that adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the báscula in only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to dispense with, first, automatic the ceiling that has been for one with manual, save 21 kilos; using doors of aluminum as the GT3,' fall' other 15; taking away the Climatizador, 13; reducing the fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres, won 7 kilograms more; sports bacquets other 12 and with the light of 19 inches, five.
Finally, to renounce the audio system CDR-30 other six kilograms and changing the of the doors for a question, the remaining kilo.
Although it also offers with the double, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual box of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads in California, in sections of mountain with routes really revirados
Their behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
The reduction of weight does not mean that the car is not the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: that testÃ¡bamos not a model so small and light that, in turn, so security in the curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the time, until I that esprinte, which slow, recover and return to squeeze its engine ...
What I ask. Thanks to his leadership, as forthcoming as accurate, what we share with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
The engine will
The sound of V6, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the option' sport' and through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already started earlier in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads that we are experiencing with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car well the potholes.
The electronic aid barely of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves are ice at dawn and, well into the morning.
In short, a car, the more fun to drive that you can in the market, and that is something more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

The team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, vegetable or micov with large doses of involvement and collective work but had to suffer until the end to secure the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 Triple had much to do in the final triumph.
The party began looking for the azulgranas, which were made from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorianos were from the perimeter was presage that had come to the Israeli court with the hot.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavés opted for the game Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pitos and applause in the return to that outside his home, to continue to expand its advantage the rest (34-43).
Teletovic already started to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points, while the' least six' assessment of splitter already presage that this was not going to be the best night of Brazilian.
But the party, despite being on track to rest, was not decided far less and the Macabeos wanted to remind the vitorianos that in its scope does not win anyone, and with' the hand of' tightening managed to get in the party.
Eidson and PNINI contributed decisively to the' yellow' return to the (50-49).
MORE
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed a couple of right to breath, and in these came the machine gun of Teletovic, with three consecutive almost triple and the help of English and Ribas returned the scoreboard to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaveses out to be skin in the latest partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take them what had been received during the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of his team not resigned and tried to keep alive his team from the line of three points (70-77).

The Unicaja lost miserably in Greece before the Olympiacos and gave him the lead in Group B of the Euroliga, in a match marked by the casualties of the cajistas, especially in the game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team malagueño not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship and not by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed to dream of the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three consecutive triple, two of the base Omar Cook and one of Guillem, to the 12-18 minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the premises in the game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him a return to the scoreboard 22-20 minute 13, at which, an action, of wrangling between the two American bases and Williams, was the disqualification of both players.
The Greek whole began to show their superiority in both areas, where the low injury of the English Joel Freeland and the three personal misconduct of Carlos Jiménez, were the Cajistas.
Among the players and the Lithuanian Kleizas, with its triple, increased the advantage 44-32 minute 19.
AN IMPOSSIBLE

The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and to the last of the Scottish Pívot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the disadvantages the Unicaja by the management and the triple of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when Apretaba and given their superiority in centimetres inside the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pívot Nikola Vujcic, managed to overcome the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja off, handing the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil puts date at the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has run to the permanence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic no later than 27 January 2010, when his term officially.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'Affaires of the embassy in the capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where remains a refugee from the 21 September.

Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tone in the markets, new uncertainty to reappear in the markets, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the players take decisions on the future nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions to assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually completed and, without questioning its policy of liquidity, begin to throw some sand in the wheels How did the ECB with its auction-year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain the economic recovery without measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have returned to, although still far from the levels that reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalise risk private and public debt returns to be affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an extension of the in the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had been affected by this episode of instability but in that Standard &amp; Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some of uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of the moral hazard that tried to create of awareness on those responsible for global economic policy for having stopped the destructive effects arising from the credit crunch on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is to order a new day of thanks.
However, of Dubai in a tribal fight between the emirs to reshape the power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new government that is pulling the wraps.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin to Hungary in a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a member country of the euro on its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and responsibility to their citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expected.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt extended like the European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European differentials falling and our continued to expand, then it would be of Spanish.
The Standard &amp; Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate their scenarios of recovery and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to his warning.
Again, the pint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver."

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in the debate these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.

For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and other 60 million between that date and 2030, provided they kept open nuclear power plants in operation today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be of 60 billion, but of up to 95 million.
Yes, believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in a generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue is changing and we will have to increase the power.
Its bid focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture and, above all, of renewable energy.
In this case, believes that we need new MW, albeit with other "of support."
Galán, who considers that the draft law of sustainable economy that has just adopted by the government is in line with what his company has been calling for, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear commitment to long-term" In this sense, despite the "measures", as the president of Iberdrola.
Be that as it may, believes that investment decisions, they are in the long term, it must begin to take because it takes to mature and a stable framework is needed to address them.

The leader of the list is Manchester United.
