The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers 
Bare slopes don't worry about just krkonošským vlekařům. 
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and boarding houses. 
It is Therefore in the Giant Mountains still can get free rooms for all winter dates, including the Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
We have an Attendance at our website. 
People pass through supply record prices, but not afraid to order. 
And if we call, so I ask if we will be this year's Christmas in the snow or mud, "said the operator information portal Spindl. Info Martin Jandura. 
Who wants to stay in the New Year Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your wishes, I the order did not hesitate. 
Those Who prefer saving money and quality of accommodation is for him to take second place, he may try to wait a couple of days. 
Špindlerovští hoteliers still offer on New Year's Eve mostly weekly stays. 
I think they will be a try to give, but then they, too, and they go for a shorter period. 
And then will be free rooms quickly disappear, "he estimated Jandura. 
Free beds in all winter dates still offers and vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours. 
Now, most interested in Christmas week, which is not yet vyprodán. 
So half of jobs in our offer remains free. 
Therefore, we have nachystali some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute, "said director Peter INGTOURS Schiefert. 
New Year's Eve in Giant vrchlabská travel agent can not offer, too, but there are fewer vacancies. 
Well i sold it the first two days in February, the other winter dates are sold on average. 
This year, interest in the winter stays adversely affects that in the Giant Mountains is still not snow. 
People wait, if you wish. 
No one wants to spend the end of the year without the snow. 
If during the week ski slopes, vyprodají even Christmas, "says Schiefert. 
On the contrary, slightly better than last year, the hotel rooms boast Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou. 
We're about five percent better. 
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we have the last couple of places. 
The big concern is about the Polish holidays in January and sells well in February, "said the director of the best hotel Karel Rada. 
Of the Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays occupied by the hotel Omnia for central parking in Janské spa. 
On the contrary, at Christmas remains in the latest janskolázeňském hotel even half the beds available. 
Pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we already have at this moment of about 60 percent. 
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the snow, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains must still rises, said the hotel manager Omnia Eric Sporysch. 
The snow, however, presents krkonošští hoteliers still have the to go. 
On Thursday, be cool, if there are any deductions, and the mountains should be snow. 
But then has once again come warming, informed Jiří Jakubský of Hradec workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. 
The US: Repetition is the mother of wisdom 
It's funny, with a schoolgirl snaživostí Barack Obama, president with a reputation as the smartest, repeated in Afghanistan's the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered It. 
When he finally vypotil its expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that her over kopírák of Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago. 
Not only in the text several times uses the word turnover as in Iraq, "but did not hesitate even to use the name of Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration:" new way forward ". 
He was three years ago, criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq beset by civil war as "irresponsible and in the aftermath of catastrophic decision ". 
The subsequent months have shown, however, that the Bush strategy based on a recommendation from the field commanders was the only possible and veleúspěšnou so that today in the intelligence on Iraq at all. 
Bush's reputation improvement, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful default situation than expected. 
In Afghanistan he hopes Barack Obama In that miracle again. 
The increase in military contingent asked him again field commanders, in particular the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, which even despite subordinačním harshly criticized the practice hesitant shooter in the White House. 
He asked 40 thousand men in order to break the situation for the better. 
The president of the three months hesitated, but nothing better, and so at least ošidil general 10 thousand soldiers. 
From Europe could squeeze out the promise of a further 5 thousands, even though he initially counted at least 10. 
On the whole Nejproblematičtějším Obama "s strategy appears to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan for 18 months and end this process within three years. The Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers. 
Many doubt that the increase in the same fruit as in Iraq. 
Despite the internecine wars of recent years is the Iraqi society relatively well ordered, its leaders to honor the agreement. 
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - the one can not count and no agreement have not been honored. 
Wrong, under these conditions, prepare the Afghan security forces accustomed to what day change master, as it suits them. 
Political institutions, even though they are formally based, will remain just Potěmkinovou village, for which will continue to spread patriarchal tribal relations. 
The balance of interests of the various ethnic groups is extremely difficult, given the nepřehlednosti ratios, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences. 
Neither the establishment of a "akceschopného state ", which is a minimalist objective of the operation, it doesn't look like all too real. 
The time horizon of Obama's strategy strikes his voluntarismem. 
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated and is now on the verge of explosion. 
To believe that sending soldiers into war turmoil in order to "an early return home" will cause here made a miracle, can only truly romantic soul, the fact untouched. 
From a political point of view, is set a date for withdrawal sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban, it will be seen as an implicit declaration of American defeat. 
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing minus. 
European politicians can't and don't want to explain to voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush. 
Another factor capable of radically to intervene in the situation is developments around Iran. 
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions on the Iranians do not produce arises from the United States přetěžká question of whether to try to solve the problem of military force. 
To reply to it will be in a time when under Obama's America to the vítěznému withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
Any such solution, however, will mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation. 
The only náplastí for Barack Obama is the fact that in the presidential election three years, and therefore there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop. 
The managers of Goldman Sachs has won "t pay in cash 
Senior managers of U. S. banks Goldman Sachs get this year rewards in cash. 
The company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its labor practices. 
A group of 30 leading managers will receive cash instead of shares that will be sold as soon as possible in five years. 
In addition, managers shares may be taken in the event that will be excessively risk. 
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency to take the lead in efforts to unite rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance. 
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction, it needs to issue, a former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott. 
The problem is in the details, he said. 
Goldman Sachs has become a target of criticism after the first three quarters of this year, the aside almost 17 billion dollars (almost 300 billion USD) in rewards. 
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year, according to the agency Reuters probably despite today ohlášenému measures exceeds 20 billion dollars. 
High remuneration in the banking sector, with the arrival of the financial crisis in a number of countries have become a hot political issue. 
Britain on Wednesday announced that it intends to bankers bonuses in excess of 25, 000 pounds (about $712.000 USD) in a lump sum to a 50 taxes. 
Similar steps preparing and France.

Janota minister is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle 
President Václav Klaus will take on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which is considering staying in the government, because it does not agree with the center of the state budget for next year, as it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies. 
It is expected that the budget, and perhaps even Janotovo remain in the cabinet will topics of their Friday meeting. 
The budget criticizes and Klaus. 
According to him, the deficit is too high, further deepening the crisis of public finances. 
The meeting of the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat. 
About his next term of office wants to act on Monday with Prime Minister John Fischer. 
According to the budget, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns. 
But the House on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left on movements of money and raise money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers. 
The government vytýkala proposals for social democracy that secretly inflate the budget deficit. 
Between left on one, and the government, Klaus and his right hand on the other hand, because of a sharp dispute, which begins to raise a question mark over the additional exposure Fischer bureaucratic cabinet, which was agreed in the spring the ODS, the Social Democrats and the Green. 
Critics argue that the budget, as the House has adopted, in a package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has imposed in the fall, and which to stop the state debt. 
Klaus, the law on the state budget may or may not sign on today's discussion breakfast with business, said that politicians a longer period of time zanedbávali "serious problem," which is "unsustainable deficitnost" of public finances. 
Today, he said he no longer has a good solution. 
Improvements could bring only strong government, which, moreover, could rely on broad consensus of political parties, said the president. 
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary, and the government should consider the further existence. 
Deputy ODS Peter Nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Greens, clearly not working. 
Prime Minister Fischer in response, called similar words for "strong statements ". 
The head of the Jiří Paroubek on Topolánek responded that the budget deficit, which the former Topolánek government prepares for this year, which exceeds 200 billion crowns. 
On Wednesday identified the approval of the state budget for next year a success. 
Satisfied were also lidovci. 
Mandela in the novelty of Clint Eastwood played Morgan Freeman 
South Africans argue that the new Hollywood film Invictus: undefeated world a lot of the country, about her struggle and victories, despite some critiques that the main role ztvárňují American actors. 
The story of The sport, racial proportions and Nelson Mandela. 
The indefatigable warrior against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story represents oscarový American actor Morgan Freeman. 
Freeman said that he jednadevadesátiletý Mandela asked whether, in the film could reproduce. 
Another important role it plays Matt Damon. 
I told him: "If I play, I will have to have access. 
72 - year-old actor, who won the prize for his role in Eastwoodově drama of the environment of boxing million Dollar Baby, for example, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from which eventually became a slave, a fictional U.S. president and even god in the divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and for many people as important as Mandela. 
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work for the end of apartheid in South Africa. 
The freedom of the was in 1990, and for four years, then became president of the country. 
In 1993, he received the Nobel Prize for Peace. 
Invictus is Latin word for the undefeated, and is the name of the English author William ernesto Henleyho issued in 1875. 
The challenge was to speak as he 
It is a true story about how Nelson Mandela has joined forces with the captain of the South African team to help unite the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after apartheid still racially and economically divided. 
He believes that He can unite his people through sport, so decided to unify rugby players who belong on a global scale between the outsiders.

Freeman worked for several years to Mandela's story on the screen. 
I had no other goal than to play this role, so I approached it the most realistic, "said Freeman. 
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him. 
The actor said that if he and the world policies were in the same area, he would've tried to meet with him, to have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech. 
The most important was that he wanted to shake hands. 
I found that when you tisknu hand assume your energy, transfers, and I felt that I know how you feel, he said. 
It's important for me to try to become a different person. 
Matt Damon acts out in the film François Pienaara, the captain of the national rugby team, in which převažovali white players. 
The actor said he had six months to prepare for his role in the tough world of football. 
The big surprise for him, it was when they first met Pienaarem in his house. 
I remember how I rang the doorbell, he opened the door and the first thing I François Pienaarovi in his life, he said was: "in the film look much more ". 
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors in comparison with their real masters under the direction Eastwood won Invictus: undefeated positive reviews, and speak as well as ambitions for an Oscar. 
Film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up by the words: "It was a very good story, very well-made film."

The secret glow over Norway rozluštěno: the Russians tested a missile 
Over Norway to observe a special light effect of unknown origin. 
Russian Defense Ministry yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
It was Start but again failed and shot known as type "Bulava ", which was originally the pride of the Russian army is slowly becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. 
Even his repeated the presence of the success of the missile tests test flights serious effect. 
Bulava majority at all nevzlétla or damaged in the air. 
The Russian newspaper was the "Bulavě" writes as a "rocket, which can not fly." 
The rocket, which can not fly but shines 
This in order for the 13th experiment was initially normally. 
Until the end of the flight was again to technical apparatus. 
The engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket. 
This time, "Bulava" taking off from a nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went below the surface of the White Sea. 
This type of missiles, allows the firing of the vessel is in motion, and at the same time submerged. 
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by the unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava ". 
Indeed, the Norwegians from the first time they had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket. 
The generals this time, and that we cannot speak clearly about failure. 
The first two degrees of missiles, and an accident to the third. 
In previous cases, porouchaly engines in the first instance. 
Although completely flawless or may not one test start, the failed leadership of the ministry of defence only six out of thirteen. 
Almost 50 success therefore generals filled with optimism and so still argue that the "Bulava" one day fly without problems and that even carry up to ten hypersonických nuclear blocks of a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.

Hyundai unions upheld. Cancels all overtime 
Management Nosovice Hyundai with the unions agreed to cancel all overtime. 
It is because of the often nařizovaným přesčasům declared unions on Monday strike emergency. 
Confirmed car Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek. 
Management, however, wants to trade union leaders to agree even on one this year's Saturday shift. 
We can not waver in our production schedule, it is essential, therefore, was designed voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December, with the result that would have made two shifts, said Vaněk. 
Server Sedmička. Cz wrote that company employees who work Saturday shift, offered a bonus of CZK 400. 
That will get people back to work Saturday, 28 November. 
The company, according to Vanek decided to change the way to motivate employees in the proposed overtime. 
Either you leave to pay for overtime or can choose alternative off 28 December, and thus have a day to extend the Christmas holidays, said Vaněk. 
In addition, all employees Saturday shift will get paid for the fare and lunch. 
Whereas the overtime were nejurgentnějším and the point of view of the comments and complaints trade unionists, even protesters employees, last week živelně stopped production, the lead yesterday afternoon decided with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk. 
Staff car companies were last week forced to virtually every day after an eight-hour shift work, even two-hour overtime. 
After the signing of the union strike alert recall 
Further negotiations between the management and the union is to take place on Friday morning. 
The union boss Peter Cook on Wednesday said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the emergency room. 
The situation came to a head last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously stávkovalo because of the constant overtime. 
Also protesting against poor pay conditions and the alleged bullying. 
Management opposed that overtime workers must do for the sake of the requirements for the supply of cars. 
The union, in its Monday's publication picket alert also requested that they are not any sanctions postihováni employees who last Wednesday cut production. 
In the field of overtime unions after the company required in order to stem the overtime work to a minimum. 
In addition, the for this year to pay a reward of 5, 000 crowns. 
Nosovice carmaker Hyundai now employs 2, 000 people. 
Series production company rode last November. 
In September this year produced roughly 80, 000 cars, its current production capacity is 200, 000 cars a year. 
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hardy" viruses HIV 
A team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body. 
The main advantage of improved substance is that it works and viruses that have acquired immunity against drugs. 
This fact in some cases outweigh the compound on a normal variant of the virus is as strongly as some already available medicines. 
AIDS still cannot be cured. 
However, patients can greatly extend the life of a mixture of drugs that inhibit reproduction of HIV in the body. 
Their use, however, is accompanied by a series of side effects. 
Incomplete suppression of propagation of the virus has resulted in the development of the so-called resistentních viruses against which are already drugs ineffective. 
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Chemical Technology Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus. 
Have shown that a substance called metalokarborany operating on a protein responsible for the reproduction of HIV. 
Metalokarborany are compounds boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt. 
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus otherwise than all today used drugs, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance. 
In his work, scientists have come with the new "improved" compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein. 
Metalokarborany have an unique three-dimensional structure: two mnohostěnné cage of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked metal, in this case kobaltem. 
Treacherous and resistant virus 
HIV protease is a protein HIV, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus. 
Without HIV proteázou caused by the HIV virus would not ripe infectious viral particles. 
When we stop HIV proteázu, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences. 
In the work published in the scientific journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which they are two pairs of cages (see table) linked short organic chain, which is also systematically pozměňován. 
A slightly weaker, but more reliable 
The effect of this series of substances against HIV proteáze was tested in vitro and also against its sturdy (rezistentním) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV. 
The effect on the normal metalokarboranů variant of the enzyme is not as strong as the clinically used drugs, but its effect does not waste for resistant variants against which are used drugs often ineffective. 
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications of metalokarboranů makes interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pauline Řezáčová, head of the lab Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics Academy of Sciences. 
The argument for the budget. ODS embarked on Fischer, he resists 
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek described the approved budget for next year as "awesome" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, he should consider the further existence. 
The Expression of ODS called prime minister for strong statements. 
He said that the time for analysis. 
ODS deputy chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly not working. 
Prime Minister, according to Minister Nečas must decide whether it intends to rely on the minority in the House, which is the struggle with rising deficits, or for him to remain in office with the help of parliamentary left. 
Access ODS and social democracy on the issue of public deficits is vastly different, "said Nečas. 
The House on Wednesday adopted a budget for 2010, but with leftist amendments for more than 12 billion crowns. 
The House increase the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers. 
Criticism of the government's proposals to address social democracy, while that secretly inflate the budget deficit. 
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns. 
ODS before the vote, left the hall, meet the wishes of the government, that the amended budget is less bad variant than the budget. 
Disappointment and frustration 
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation even more. 
Nečas is convinced that, if Janota seriously threatened departure from office in the case of the amendments, the situation could be different. 
According to the Czech television Janota ordered on Monday after the government of Prime Minister. 
He suggested that is considering further remain in office. 
The reason is his disappointment of the negotiations on the budget. 
If Fischer is willing to continue the fight the budget deficit, the Nečas in government what to do nominanti Social Democrats, who pushed through changes in the budget. 
Prime Minister should also clearly say that he would resign if the House approves further legislation increasing the deficit, such as those relating to the sick, pensions, or amendments to the Staff of the law. 
Topolánek: Ministers nominated ODS guilty 
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government. 
Ministers nominated ODS done nothing wrong, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the U. S. 
He reminded that on several ministries are náměstkovských features people hlásící to TOP 09, who voted against the budget. 
Nečas stressed that if the Fischer decides to abandon the principle of the fight with the amount of deficit, "is perfectly logical and correct that, on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the House of Commons. 
Then, but can not count on support from and tolerance of Civic Democrats. 
I hadn't thought about it, and when it is the current, so it will take, told reporters in the House Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated by the government of the Civic Democrats. 
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon left for the European Council in Brussels. 
At the request of Prime Minister withdrew ODS 
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would be in the House on Wednesday voted against an amended budget, if the Prime Minister of the Civic Democrats explicitly requested that the adoption of the budget allowed. 
Nepřipadáme as orphans, we are not small children, then responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget netížila absence of the parties in parliament and the Czech Republic. 
I have not noticed that my voice was missing. 
Even When I was giving up the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months will be bolševizaci House and destruction of all positive, he said. 
According to the new procedure will be less trains for almost the same fares 
Czech railways from 13 December will cancel or reduce some less vytížené rychlíky and lokálky, other connections, on the contrary,. 
The total range of transport from the date of application of the new timetable reduced in comparison with today by two percentage points. 
Most of the tariffs, including the basic and customer fare will not change. 
More options related to the capital gain, for example, the people Ostrava, on this route add one set of Pendolino. 
On the contrary, the high-speed train ride to Bratislava. 
Less rychlíků vyjede also along the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, significantly reduces the direct connections Praha - Letohrad. 
The regions are planning to track the largest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové region, a total of eight percent increase, on the other hand, can look forward to Prague and. 
Aborting also two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and operation of several trains on the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to certain days of the week. 
The biggest changes include the introduction of new direct flights to Prague, today must switch in Lysá nad Labem. 
This is the fifteenth line of peri-urban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification lines of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice. 
Long-haul flights to the capital will go at the destination Station Prague Main Railway Station. 
Čd introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka / Jeseník will go at two-hourly intervals. 
Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December passengers. 
This year's account for regional rail: about 200 million more 
Rychlíky objednává and the ministry of transport, total of the so-called demonstrable losses next year, four billion crowns, as well as this year. Lokálky anyway pay for them, the next eight billion crowns, with less than three billion regions will become. 
This year are regional trains about 200 million more expensive. 
I have the newly concluded a ten-year contract, has always the contract for one year. 
The runway system, and therefore likely to increase the of the overwhelming majority of tickets. 
Changes will occur only in The network tickets čd Net and cheap internet ticket Eliska. 
For passengers without the customer card, the price of čd Net increase of 450 crowns to 600 crowns. 
Price Elišky will newly based on the distance travelled, was for the journey between any regional cities uniform and was 160 crowns. 
Filipino militants still holds more than 50 people, including the freedom 
Gunmen Today in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including some primary school pupils and their teachers. 
It said the agency AFP, which was initially reported only about 65 hijacked.

Approximately 19 militants apparently used hostages as a living shield to escape from the police. 
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining hostages. 
According to the agency AFP militants belongs to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). 
According to the AP police originally kidnapper pursued because of the violence, which has cost a settling of accounts between two local family clans. 
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was due to the recent massacre, in which were killed 57 people, declared martial law.

On suspicion of involvement in the massacre was arrested the governor of this jihofilipínské provinces and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch influential of the House Ampatuanů. 
On the island of Mindanao are engaged also Muslim separatists. 
But on Tuesday renewed peace talks with the Philippine government. 
The story of JAR applies to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela 
In the next few days in American cinema a new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech sounds Invictus: undefeated), which is part of the story of former South African President Nelson Mandela. 
The role of the world-famous warrior against apartheid has been undertaken by Morgan Freeman, which he said for his portrayal of years ago chose Mandela. 
The male role of the legendary South African champion in rugby Francoise Pienaara assuming Matt Damon. 
With the film in cinemas arise from critics and the public feedback 
Nelson Mandela 
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa Mvezu. 
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993, together with de Klerk Nobel Peace Prize. 
The President of South Africa was in 1994 - 1999. 
Great expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in South Africa, on the first of the preparations for the world Cup, at the same time, the media are crying disturbing reports of increasing racial hatred and discrimination against the ruling majority.

About the role I've dreamed for many years and for it. 
Many times I have also personally met with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - načerpal his energy, said in an interview after the gala premiere of the film in Los Angeles.

All three hejtmani attacks against us and talk about the fact that we choose the raisins, while we brought the offer only on what they wanted. 
He says that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the price of Czech Railways, which were concluded last week. 
So we have to defend myself. 
It is a slander against the company Student Agency, he said radiožurnálu Jančura. 
It also said that there is evidence from all regions failing their steps in accordance with the European law. 
Therefore, the initiative for the European Commission. 
Hasek filing criminal notification is the continuation of the media show Mr Jančury, which serves as an unpaid advertising his company and his own people.

Vaccination against pneumokokům will be free and optional 
Vaccination against pneumococcal January rooted habits. 
To be the first family for free, and at the same time. 
We do not reverberating voices, it would be compulsory vaccination more effective. 
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peak. 
Pharmaceutical institute has set a maximum price of vaccines, which pays health insurance companies. 
Experts have also have clear procedures for vaccination. 
New vaccine 
Free vaccines for children in August 
From January may be free of charge vaccinated against pneumokokům children born last 2 August and later. 
The condition is that it did not even one dose of vaccine. 
Who began to vaccinate last year or earlier, he must pay for himself and other booster. 
The first dose of vaccination must be made between 3 and 5 months of age. 
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against pneumokokům a quarter of families. 
Parents while paying 1600 crowns per dose of even more. 
The vaccination, the youngest children are the need for four doses. 
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies to get on the vaccine doses of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year. 
Saves But treatment that children without vaccination needed. 
Not worth all the vaccination of children was roughly 500 thousand a year. 
Vaccination was introduced so-called Janotovým package. 
Pneumococcal causing middle ear, but also serious infections including zánětů brain fever and blood poisoning. 
The pneumococcal infection in for the year will die under investigation in hospitals to 28 children under 10 years. 
In addition to the Czech Republic introduced by the vaccination of children against pneumokokům around in 40 countries. 
The vaccination will be compulsory? 
At the same time, but there are views that in the future could be the vaccination compulsory. 
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional. 
It would be compulsory vaccination better suggested, for example, the head of the civic association Unmute Rudolf Kalovský. 
The association promotes pneumococcal vaccine in the long term. 
Experts at the international conference, which our associations participated in, they were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination. 
It is not exactly ideal. 
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to push through at least this. 
I think that's the way that we have to get in, said Kalovský. 
The Ministry of Health but the vaccination against pneumococcal want to change. 
At the moment about it At all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Hornet. 
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors 
The President of the practical children's doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages. 
If they were vaccinated all children, could be considered to reduce the number of booster "in a situation where this vaccine is so high amount, quite understand the political decision that vaccination was started as a voluntary," says, of course, Cabrnochová. 
Experts expect that their infants to vaccinate against pneumokokům from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents. 
Vaccination against pneumokokům is a breakthrough even that it was the first area vaccination of children borne by the health insurance companies, not the state. 
Insurance companies should make money on prevention, save it for further treatment, explains Cabrnochová. 
Doctors will have to buy yourself substance 
It is about practical children's doctors, which relate to the shopping vaccines. 
According to the original intention should buy insurance companies and doctors would receive just as they become available to the rest of the vaccine. 
Some members, however, feared that could insurance companies "transfer the money from health insurance. 
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substance and wait for them to reimburse insurance companies. 
According to estimates, the practical child doctors to invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a significant sum. 
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.

It may be a Muslim Frenchman? 
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. 
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on building minarets and is generally spread scare stories about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed, and thought about the fact that Muslims integrate Muslims - and whether to integrate - into one of the open secular societies of the continent. 
Some of the readers, after reading this book became admirers artist's last works, "Why the French do not like scarves on his head" (2006), this elegant and diskutovanou study on the issues that divide and employ the country for a period of 15 years and whose effects are pociťovány still today. 
The last book Mr. Bowen has a broader and much more ambitious scope. 
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the base. 
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now taking care of 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen called "Islamic areas'. 
It is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues, which is most worried about. 
Should a Muslim enter into matrimony in the mosque or at the hall (or in both places)? 
It should be young Muslim vyučován about development and the rights of gay? 
It may be a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim? 
He has the right to use zájmově oriented banking system, if it wants to get a mortgage? 
It is these seemingly mundane issues, which are discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than the political drama, which employ media. 
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known people, including Tarika Ramadana, Arab, Muslim explorer and academic, born in Switzerland. 
This new generation is trying to open a debate about how it can also be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society. 
They have arguments for all their custom. 
The Conservatives are suspicious of the actual idei French or European Islam. 
Philosophers and activists that Mr. Bowen conducted interviews, to doměnce that this is a counterpart Selafiho - supporters puristy Sunni Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia - this group is small, but affects the European Muslims. 
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible. 
But the adaptation requires compromises on both sides. 
It wonders how far they are French politicians (and intellectual elite that so obstinately defends the general public) actually committed to the idea of pluralism. 
It is of the opinion that Muslims are in matters of faith may have less experience than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromise with secular republikánstvím. 
Rather than the development of pragmatism found "tightening the screws values." 
It can be a Muslim Frenchman? After reading this book may have a tendency to say "yes, but not now."

U. S. government contractor jailed Cuban government officials 
The Cuban government has enveloped the American government supplier, which imported mobile phones and laptops to the country, according to officials of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday. 
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for the Development Alternatives, Inc., based in Bethesda. 
The company is working on projects for the U. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. 
Consular officials, together with the U. S. interest section in Havana looking for access to the boarded, who was arrested 5 December. 
Certain charges has not been made public, but according to the Cuban rights may be a Cuban citizen or a stranger imprisoned for almost anything, what labeled as "dangerous ". 
All the so-called kontrarevolucionářské activities, which include mild protests and critical Stati, raise the risk of imprisonment. 
Anti-graffiti and speech are considered serious offenses. 
In Cuba, there is a young blogující community, led by a popular commentator Yoani Sánchezovou, who often writes about how she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents. 
Mrs. Sánchezová repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country, in order to take the prices, but it was denied. 
The detention of American suppliers may be the result of growing tensions between the communist Castro's brother, the ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was monitored as a "delaying tactics" in improving relations with the island. 
The first report on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night. 
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government will take concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, the United States take reciprocal steps. 
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodity in a country where the average wage of state employees is $15 per month. 
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones in this year; these are used mostly prpo textovýchg send messages textovýchg 15 - minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage. 
The use of the Internet on the island is mimořádn limited. 
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and some government přípojkách, such as universities. 
The Cubans, who often want to log on, must notify their names to the government. 
Access to many web site is prohibited. 
Detention of American in Cuba is rare. 
Most of the handful of U. S. citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for tresné actions, such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbenová, press officer for the American interests section in Havana. 
Mrs. Berbenová said that cannot provide more information about the prison. 
His arrest and detention were clearly immoral. 
Such activities, which would in any other open society were legal - say, free mobile phones - are in Cuba a criminal offence, Miguel said Vivanco, director of the U. S. program group for human rights, which recently published a negative report on freedoms in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and compensation for the ailing older brother Fidel. 
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day. 
He said that any solution would be more political, and that the Cuban government often provoke a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are heading for extensive dialogue. 
Pakistani civil servants rozkrývají conspiracy, concerning the broadcasting of men in Afghanistan. 
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of the conspiracy, concerning the deployment of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the American troops, and said they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists, which he's on the Internet and finds radicalized young men. 
Investigators said they searched the gray rebel personality, known as Saifulláh, who invited the men to Pakistan after it first appeared, when one of these men published a commentary officer terristické attacks Ma internet videostránce YouTube. 
Saifilláh assumed leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes Pakistan, which is home to Al Qaeda and its training camps for training of terrorists. 
But Pakistani intelligence official who submitted a report on the case, said on Saturday that Saifulláh was unsuccessful in usvědčování commanders, and that the men were part of the CIA infiltration into the terrorist network. 
As a result, they were dropped off for a few days in the eastern district Sarghody, far from the mountains in the northwest, which has become a haven for terrorists. 
They were seen as an unit. 
That is why they were dropped, said the official, who spoke on anonymity given the sensitivity of the case. 
The official said that the men were scared away and still trying to obtain approval to gain access to the camps of al Qaeda, when they were arrested by the law. 
The case of the five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned FBI - underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, determine who is trusted. 
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U. S. intelligence service attaches the highest priority attempts at the location of the human resources to al Qaeda. 
Recruiters organizations function as guards, vyřazující those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to a holy war and those who might be spies. 
American mock recruits were subjected to Al Qaeda special scrutiny, analysts said. 
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because due to their potential access to U. S. targets, and their promotional value. 
But Evan Kohlmann, older analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said that terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years, in order to allow that up to them, because the American intelligence agencies received experts on their recruitment methods. 
If you are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which was already so much monitored? Said Mr. Kohlmann. 
This model is one of those, which is far more based on the web. 
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanded a climate "action" 
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday and pressed for stronger action on climate from negotiators in the city center of Bella. 
The protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police odnaduje that the number was closer to 25, 000. 
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists put several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center. 
On the day when the minor incident occurred in the talks On climate change, which by the UN, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried banners with English inscriptions, "This is not a planet B" (i. e., secondary) and one in španěltštině that proclaimed "Land says" enough ". 
Protest participated in several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensenové, which stated that to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and provide me information about the dismal state of the country, which has the impact of climate change, which still occurs. 
This is part of the reason why we decided to connect to this great march - through the world and to appeal to the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said. 
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, it can not be avoided. 
Police prevented the protesters to converge toward the center of Bella and said that it arrested 19 persons, primarily because they either deployed or masks or carry a pocket knife. 
These activities are under Danish law during demonstrations banned. 
According to one of the spectators, who did not wish to be identified, because it is involved in rohovorů about climate, activists maskovaní as athletes and in black suits placed several bombs near the main channel, which is located near several ministries. 
Agitovali buildings, he said, zahajivali flares, but followed by "several large explosions." 
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon. 
But the protest is likely to into the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, the Chinese negotiator on climate change. 
When he was asked whether demonstrations should constructive impact on international negotiations, said the English "actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (actually it's something you neuvědomuji). 
Then continued čínčtině and said, "because the scene is extensive, I can not hear what's going on out there. 
He was the march of pain or helpful depending on the outlook for everyone. 
You can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said. 
In other words: "We can also say that it is a distortion of the negotiations or the freedom of others. 
The date of the test revealed the persistent racial disparities 
Federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public education district of Columbia. 
Although the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate showed greater progress for pupils in fourth and osmých classes for the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York. 
But what remains hidden behind the last of the numbers of national atestačního centre for progress in teaching are persistent differences in the knowledge between afroameričany and white students and the page after page local and national. 
The average result of white students čtvrtých classes District of Columbia for the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their african-american peers nrůstu occurred only by three points from 209 to 212. 
The difference in the knowledge is actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points. 
Progress on the African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point of 245 to 245. 
The average result for white students was not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough. 
The Image in term of six years is not very encouraging. 
The difference between white and black students čtvrtých classes in 2003, when the first NAEP was in the district was 60 points scale (262 to 202). 
Even if the result in children from oboiu groups during this period, the difference is closer to 58. 
Some advocates of education in the district in the last week expressed that the results, oslavované tajemnicí Michelle A. Rheeovou and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were for white students extensively stimulated where there were already high results. 
That would be hinting that we have increased the amount of support at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality vdělávání in the district. 
Neskáču up and down because of the diffusion of two or three points, said a member of the committee D. C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade elementary school in Eatonu. 
Often kritizujíce style of management of Mrs Rheeové, Mrs Brown said that the report on the results of the test means secondary education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention. 
It is clear that always want to see the virtues and I respect that. 
But what is horrible, that we are not pay almost no time and energy, which was the need to pursue our middle education. 
Mrs. Rheeová said that the district is continuing in search of better ways of addressing the needs of students with low results. 
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, Wilson reading system, aimed at students in higher grades of primary schools and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading before in his kolní kariéřea significantly lag behind their peers. 
Everyday Mathematics curriculum and teaching math to sixth grade, emphasizing the games and experience of real life that in the district in the former director Clifford Janeyiho is attributable to the progress NAEP, which has been the subject of a report last week. 
And just think that we should continue to work and implement the best possible interventions for those students who remain below class, "said Mrs. Rheeová. 
Others said that the results NAEP clarify the question of whether Mrs. Rheeová can continue in svyšování overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary for the difference. 
It's a definite dilemma Mrs Michell Rheeové, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley where studying the results of the tests in urban areas. 
The procedure remedy is to focus resources and administrative reforms at the school, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia. 
This can focus bring political repercussions, which is directed against the relevant agenda. 
But, however, the other city managers who are trying to keep the central prúměr between white and black. 
We must focus on building a system of large schools. 
We must utužit affinity of our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be provided an excellent public schooling. 
Mr. Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, he said in an interview this week that an essential element of the reduction in the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to place the validity of schools. 
You must get up to 200 days, You can push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded an agreement with the teachers last school year in the length of 185 days, which is considered to be a "flag" to search for a greater increase in the next year. 
To make higher education part of a better future 
Tour bus pulled into Gettysburgské tracks with a loud oddychováním. 
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, and for a moment on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns. 
Gracielini Parents barely completed high school in El Salvador. 
Yet Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the house. 
Now she and other pupils eighth grade in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition was 38690 dollars a year, their position was rather than ustrašení visitors enthusiasm potential students. 
Yes! that's it! Graciela, which would like to study medicine, when the wizard offered to enter into the building of knowledge. 
Wow, really? She said thoughtfully, as they betrayed low ratio of professors to students. 
Pennsylvánská track was one of the seven, which visited on its three-day trip, and now they were completely preoccupied with the future message: the question is not whether you enter the house. 
The question is where. 
But this is a problem concerning the high number of children born in the US, Spanish immigrants who are excluded from the universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get the college education and enter into the middle class. 
In fact, a fifth of this "duhé generation" of Spanish students from college - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central America, they came to the United States, without finished high school. 
Their story of success is important, researchers, because it underlines the point the way forward for the generation that has played a marginal role in the field of the labor force. 
Those who have achieved higher education say that they have a natural náklonpost to school and congenital assertiveness and desire to succeed. 
Many also had parents who set their children high goals and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the American education. 
But school programs also play a special role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to have track - especially if these efforts in time persists. 
If you to ensure that children come from groups with low incomes, whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them norientovat in the system, free from any interference in each individual point is resolved, says Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area. 
We have to think about it, to provide these children záchytnou network in preschool age in all ways to pročšly high school. 
The federal program that funded the trip graciela on rails, is an useful example. 
Known as gear UP (připtravit), provides more than 300 million dollars a year for the local school systems for starting college preparatory programs, which used for students from groups with small income to secondary schools and continue until these students quit high school. 
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the tracks, according to the U. S. Department of Education. 
The Iraqi oil Ministry has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies 
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get the major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure during the two auctions, which took place on Saturday. 
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of oil industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, ochromeného decades of war and sanctions. 
American companies go with capital participation on two of 10 vydražených fields. 
Seven U.S. companies pay for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday. 
Only one has lost. 
Two U. S. companies have reached agreements on the field, which was auctioned in June. 
The paltry participation of American oil giants in an open Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts. 
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and American companies here in the first place on the way Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news. 
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for sale. 
Concerns about safety, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U. S. army is likely to discourage U. S. companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has the third largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say. 
American companies have been in some cases at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk, because they are not accountable to shareholders. 
Society Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U. S. companies, which have concluded an agreement with the Ministry. 
Leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil industry and to offer technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed. 
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts that have been committed at the end of this week. 
The China National Petroleum Corp. Contributed to the menus at more contracts than any other companies and left with large stakes in contracts to two main fields. 
We all know that China seeks to become the main economic, as well as technological power, said a spokesman for the ministry of oil industry Assam Jihad. 
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and to meet its commitments to Iraq. 
The company, which have been provisionally selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the price of a barrel and the ministry is willing to pay for the output above the current level in each field. 
A top al Qaeda was probably killed in Pakistan. 
When the impact of American missiles at the border between Pakistan and Afganistánem this week was probably killed peak planner operations al Qaeda, as the U. S. officials announced on Friday counter-terrorism Department. 
As confirmed, it could be the second fatal attack on one of the highest leaders of the terrorists. 
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several missiles fell in čtvrtrek on their car near the town of Miran Śáh in the province of Sevverní Vaziristan, according to American resources and pakisttánských officials in the area. 
Local authorities ounámily that rockets were launched from an airplane type, which operates the CIA in the Gaza illegal indigenous tribes. 
They were directed to a white car, which was heading to the Afghan border, when he was hit, said the official, together with pakistánskou cicilní intelligence agency, who was on the phone from Miran Shah. 
The official said that local militants the approach to a point, and quickly zabavilito, what was left of "totally destroyed bodies. 
Local authorities have not been able to verify the identity of the victims, but two U. S. officials NYPD nespecifikovaného department had cited a witness who said that the Somali was poi death. 
Somali has been cited as a senior planner military operations Al Qaeda, who directed the terrorist groups outside the area of Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
He was involved in zosnovávání throughout the world, said a senior official, who did not wish to be named, which claimed the sensitive nature of American air strikes on the territory of Pakistan. 
If he held a central position, was probably involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe. 
He received instructions from Al Qaeda's top leadership and on the basis of them planned possible terrorist attacks. 
Another American official said that the Somali advanced rapidly in the hierarchy of Al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region. 
Not to be widely known person for some Americans, but that in no way neponižoval in front of us and our allies posed, said another official. 
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second, a senior leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban which should be killed since September, when in a similar attack was killed Najmudin Jalolov, leader of the militant factions in the Gaza indigenous tribes and three other top poperativní leaders. 
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft decreased since the summer from an average of approximately six transactions per month to two, according to the Long War, Web sites, managed by the nonprofit group. 
Reduction may be the reason in improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by the also ruthlessly kill people, which should have suspected that are informers, said Page. 
Senior delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned. 
Senior delegate the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he wanted to resign from his post in March and end a stormy term, which was mařeno allegations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations. 
The Eide departure occurs because the Obama administration decided to send 30, 000 additional U. S. troops to Afghanistan. 
The U.N. delegate said that he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the timetable for the U. S. state, which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO nations to withdraw their forces. 
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal Afgáncům that they have confidence in the international community, he said in a telephone interview from Kabul. 
The commitment must be long-term. 
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting the political transformation of Afghanistan. 
The increase of the armed forces must be copied on the civilians, he said. 
Eide said that nerezignuje, but that simply fulfills the promise he gave his family in March 2008, in Kabul spends only two years. 
He said that he wanted to report to the UN. 
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now said that he needed time to find a replacement. 
As I said, it is high time to look after the dauphin, he said. 
When I came here, there was a vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival. 
According to officials of the U.N. Ban began searching for refunds. 
Officials said that will be decided between Staffanem di Misturou, which has a Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhennem, a Frenchman, who led the U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
Eideho position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraithovi, who was accused in September President Hamidem Karzáím, who won the presidential election of camouflage the presence of massive electoral machinations. 
Eide denied those allegations, but said that the allegations Galgraitha - which was released - "certainly damage the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election. 
Eide said that the proposed meeting with the chief representative of citizens for the coordination of relief efforts for the leadership of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 
Also urgoval the leadership of the U.N. to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries, which would be for the Afghan mission, because, he says, wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is utilized properly. 
Eide expressed disappointment over the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan and said that the heavy-handed regulation to hire undermine its ability to use. 
The U.N. rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain since May, only one person, he said. 
This is a disaster, and I can not continue. 
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions 
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose on Iran "significant additional sanctions" because of a lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions. 
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a weekly trip to areas where the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the prospects of military action against the Islamic Republic. 
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to the question of a soldier on the likely evolution. ¨ 
One of the things that depend on me, is that if I learnt about something from Iraq over the past six years, (it) is neodmyslitelná unpredictability in the war. 
The Obama administration decided on a package of sanctions, which could hit iránskou military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the ordinary Iránce. 
He said that "a package of incentives and barriers" would require "to persuade the government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will be extremely suffer" sanctions. 
According to Friday's opinion, issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration engaged European leader in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the Committee for nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Iran insists it wants to develop their expertise only for peaceful purposes. 
In talks in Geneva 1 October indicated that he wants to return to talks on reducing their nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of its stocks enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to the implementation of medical research. 
The administration has done for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations. 
But since then, it seems, Iran withdraws from the interim agreements - partly because the expert, because irámské leadership is divided views on whether to engage in the United States. 
Frankly, if the Iranian obstinacy to the international community, in the case of certain proposals, which was agreed at the beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on the path that is not on the terminology of additional sanctions against Iráncům, said the Gates. 
President Obama made on 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before the returns to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "degradujícími sanctions. 
In its opinion, issued in New York, Iranian mission at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what she called "groundless and unsubstantiated allegations" against some members of the Security Committee on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that he wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solutions. 
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met this morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuku and Kurdish leaders in Irbilu. 
There remains high tension between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, mainly because of the border, property rights and the distribution of income. 
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to zabránlo delay the U.S. plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115000 to 50, 000 by the end of August. 
Gates also tried to dampen concerns about Kurdish persistent depression. Official U. S. site quoted Gates, he told Massoudu Barzáanímu, President kurdistánské regional governments: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomiji in an united Iraq. 
We do not want to leave you. " 
In an ageing China, change course 
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which read that "Mother Earth is too tired to fund more children" and "one child," means one grave. 
Then they got a lesson that when the official government jobs in Shanghai, alarmována low birth rate and ageing population in their city, suddenly changed course in this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never. 
We have always spent all their time and energy to just one child. 
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31 years, the human resources, which has 8měsíčního son. 
More than 30 years of China's policy of China have only one child was introduced and thereby created only two generations of the notoriously boubelatých and zhýčkaných children affectedly dubbed "little emperors ", the country's population crisis. 
The average fertility rates declined to 1.8 children per couple compared with six than vpolitika vsoupila in force, according to The UN. 
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years and above, predicts that will grow from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31, 1 percent in 2050. That's far above the overall average of around 20 percent. 
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example, in Shanghai. 
Last year, people aged 60 years and above were almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple. 
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai municipal committee on population and family planning said, many couples have children, "to help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and reduce the staff of the workforce in the future." 
He says it's about "being old, it does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden." 
The gradual uklidňování 
As has been inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party. 
The pair, which violated the policy, face great fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work. 
China's official positions advocated policies that helped the country avoid critical of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned to enforce policy. 
In rural areas, some officials forcing pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions. 
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexisticky selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women. 
In recent years, population officials were progressively milder in its opinion on the one-child policy. 
In 2004, as a rule, povolovali výce exceptions - including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and in cases where a man and woman were only child - and in 2007 to mitigate their passwords, the hard line. 
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of population research Beijing university, said that officials of the central government has previously debated the more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, if one of the partners was an only child. 
In June, Šanghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign for incitement to more. 
Almost overnight, the posters, nabádající parents to have only one child, replaced with a copy of the regulation, describing in detail how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for a permit. 
The city administration has sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under the door. 
Also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child. 
The response was cool, said officials for planning families. 
Zarmucující response 
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai experienced an increase in the interest of couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban precincts reported changes. 
Urban district Huinan with populations 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month. 
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165 000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008. 
Feng Juying, head of the Committee for family planning in Shanghai čtvti Caolu said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children. 
They want to provide the best first child, he said. 
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, she said she would like to have two children, and being legally allowed. 
But like many Chinese, who have only a lack of health and life insurance provided by the government. 
Without dociální záchytné network could be the choice of irresponsible. 
People in the West on the one child policy is wrong as a matter of legal question, says Yang, a structural engineer, whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in volume with the first child. 
Yes, we have been deprived of the chance to have more than one child. 
But the problem is not only in politics. 
It is about money. 
Other couples cite psychological reasons hesitation. 
Wang, manager of human resources, says that they want only one child, because she also was an only child: "We focus our families and all of us cared. 
We were not used for the provision of care and, in fact, we did not want to take care of the other. 
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who vlatní translation company, has put it much nepokrytěji. 
For dvoukariérové middle-class parents, who lowered birth rates, he said, be successful means to be selfish. 
Today's 20 and 30letí dorůstající nahlížejí on parents as a, the first days číského experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of živita for himself, he says. 
Just one child places enormous demands on time parents, he says. 
The mother must sacrifice for at least two years of his social life. 
Then there are disputed issues propstoru - "You have to rebuild your apartment" - and strategy - "You must have a summary prepared at a time when the child is 9 months for a good pre-school education. 
Most of his friends wants to be content with one child, says Che, but not two. 
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says. 
We do not want to make too many victims. 
The U.N. group outlined a plan to cut emissions. 
The U.N. sponzorovaná conference on climate change - largely characterized neukázněnými position and mutual osočováním - again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the immediate term. 
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, stresses the remaining obstacles as well as the way forward. 
But it was important progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week. 
Created the U.N. ad hoc Working Group, the text subtly indicates how much money rich countries should provide the poor for dealing with global warming in the short term and long term. 
A provides the full range of options for the key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to reduce their output of carbon and what should be the upper limit the increase in global temperature, which will be able to tolerate. 
It dodábá process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the high representative of the Sierra Club. 
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested šestistránkový document zestručnění from 180 pages of text from the negotiations to focus on what a top official on the issues at the U.N. climate, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture ". 
Outlines the contours of a possible agreement, in which could industrial nations together to reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 percent. 
Together, the country to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent. 
The European Union urgently discussed on Friday promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change - from managing floods and droughts to prevent deforestation. 
Still but Friday said the same sort of verbal fireworks which prevailed in talks in the last week. 
The U.S. special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with dobrovolností among the major emerging economies, if not be financed by the developed world. 
The shift signaled that the Obama administration nastolila harder line against China go Bush administration officials just two years ago. 
The United States accedes to the treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of actions, "said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to cover the limitations and should be examined by external observers. 
Stern made this comment a hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the U. S. climate negotiators on issues that either a lack of "common sense" or "exceptional irresponsibility" led earlier in the week to the statement that the United States would help financially China to deal with global warming. 
With the future economic track of the world "s major powers at stake, both within the developing world, and between the industrial world and emerging economies. 
The current fight is mostly on the conservation of individual economies, rather than on the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States on the performance of their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that two of the most influential countries in the world to ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of the action. 
Ricardo Ulate, delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of omezováníí greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in seeking Order to prevent large issuers responsibly in their actions. 
This is clearly a game that new economic hegemony is developing, he said Ulate, which also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation. 
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné effects of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue enforce legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants, said that the best result of the talks will be the political agreement. 
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, has created a 24stránkový draft agreement last Friday morning. 
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international negotiations on climate change in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations "has caused a political tlkak on the polirtický process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies, such as China and India. 
Negotiations led to a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that must resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of governments compete agreement. 
High-ranking officials, such as, for example, the Indian minister of environmental protection and Chinese deputy minister stepped out of the aircraft and the halls Bella Center to the closed door meetings and conferences so they could chart a new claims, which will be assessed next week. 
Total rozsáhlost Assembly - where 13, 000 people every day to and from the convention center, the guitar playing activists inscenovali night ironizující spectacle of countries, which are considered to be sent, and for the transmission of proposals from hand to hand on paper rather than by electronic mail - controlled challenge. 
The intensity is only an extension: in Copenhagen were present almost all of the key ministers and earlier in the center of the 60 heads of state. 
We got into the high category, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for global policy for international nature conservation. 
Come heavyweights. 
British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday feelings 
At 5:13 Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the train, which meant a revolution transport in Britain. 
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches the speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras and beyond the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes. 
Lord Adonis, minister of transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmesové and got into the first high-speed passenger trains outside lLndýn. 
He hopes that the new service, where the UK with an international network of fast, reliable, trains and connects large agglomerations Midland, North and Scotland with London. 
Disregarded stagnant water should reduce transport times in passenger traffic and trade routes and the transition from aircraft and cars on the rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate the congestion on the roads. 
In theory, the three main political parties to get to this vision. 
But dozens of bilinů pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental insults now přibrzdily building British high-speed lines. 
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a government study, submitted its report to Lord Adonisovi 30 December, as stated Times. 
She gave him a detailed route map for the further stages planned high-speed network. 
The new trace links London with the West Midlandem was designed to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where dopat on the propstředí could be problematic. 
In open country was scheduled to 25 m final routes. 
HS2 also expected to identify three options for extensive high-speed network leading to the north. 
Lord Adonis reply in the spring. 
The preferred option is konfikurace Y-shaped, with one high-speed line should lead to the West Midland. 
The track should share with one near the Birmingham branch, through the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and the other, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne. 
One track should lead to Scotland. 
"It seems that It was the most effective choice," he said, and expert railways. 
This is done, driving times between London and Edinburgh shall be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes. 
The first stage, which will not be opened before the year 2025, could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the present. 
Proposals should allow trains to travel at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe. 
The initial route has been proposed to hold the trains in the length of 400 m, which would have been able to carry 1100 people. 
To 18 trains would operate every hour on the route London - Birmingham. 
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve the needs of up to 20 000 passengers per hour. 
Due to capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded so that pojmula high-speed network. 
Experts from železničníhoprůmyslu argues that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential. 
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not to implement this scheme, but the extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that keč final decision will not before the general election. 
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should build after parts. 
Trains should first be put into service on the high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours. 
This is regarded as a crucial contact point for the transition from aircraft on trains, reference point for the revolution to rail. 
Taxpayers pay the mortgage of £75, 000 pounds on oranžérii Tories 
Alan Duncan, the holder of the front benches in the House of Commons taxpayers pay taxpayers thousands of pounds costs last year, which has built in his House in the electoral district.

He was allowed to charge special interest, overall, hundreds of pounds a month to taxpayers. 
Local authorities have approved claims in a timely and was questioned by Sir Thomasen Leggem, who carried out the member výdajlů. Last night, Mr Duncan said their requirements "menohlo be cleaner and simpler."

The last document municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds a month in May this year.

And I could claim the whole bloody share, but I will not. " 
Rep., a millionaire from the former career as a businessman with oil, was first asked to explain their issue in May, when it turned out that claimed thousands of pounds for your garden, before approving the tax office that it "May be regarded as excessive ". 
One of the activists dig a hole in the shape of a pound sign in the lawn of Mr. Duncan in protest after revealed that claimed 4, 000 pounds for a period of three years. 
When he was last night dotazován to increase mortgages, Mr Duncan said: "It was because of an increase in capital, which was approved by both the tax authority and subsequently Leggem." 
He added: "It is not a question of hiding and or violations of rules or something different. 
It's absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, and that's all. 
It would nenohlo be many other spůsoby cleaner or simpler. "

Secretary of defense, whose party is a partner UMP, had planned this strategy to confirm the Saturday before the National Council movement Nouveau Centre (NC). 
This step has the support of the MEP Hervé de Charetta (former za-UMP now for NC), who assigns ownership of the UDF, because it was the first left in 2004 to register in the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut National de la propriété industrielle). 
But on Friday evening, the committee of the Association of UDF directed friends François Bayrou, who do not intend to let expropriate, stepped out of his silence and gave a formal request to the Minister to stop using the shortcut and handed back the ownership of the trade mark, under the threat of criminal prosecution. 
In the last few days, concern about the statement that its political movement + to take the abbreviation of the UDF, writes in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the committee, of which, for example, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the modem or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance centriste. 
At the same time, you are considered appropriate to place on their promotional materials and on the website of the name of your name + Nouveau centre +, with the slogan + UDF today +, state also signatories to the letter. 
As you are aware, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the committee UDF, which asks the NC "immediately remove all references the names of all promotional materials including (their) website. 
At the same time asking Hervé de Charettea "to gave ownership of legitimate trade mark ". 
If not, turn to the courts to be respected the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories. 
In his letter indicates that the UDF "is a fully-fledged political hnutíod 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" departure in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish the UMP. 
The Nouveau centre has, therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française). 
At the same time point out that the last Congress UDF voted in 2007 to connect to a modem for three years and for the creation of a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" associations based Valery Giscard d'Estaing. 
As regards Hervé de Charettea, continues the committee, "when the registered trade mark ", not" for three years a member of the UDF ", but the UMP. 
Skandálním and fraudulently used the non-existent registration akronyma to do so on its own account. 
This indiscretion is beginning to convert to a criminal offense, they contend, and then with irony expressed on the strategy of NC: "It seems to us that both in politics, in everyday life is more valuable to create a name for himself, than to withdraw from the anonymity of fraudulent adoption names which we have no right." 
Case Liliane Bettencourtové: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of state weakness. 
The court in Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Baniera and bring judgment whether he used state weakness osmdesátileté miliardářky to prepare it for a part of its assets, of which it blames her daughter Liliane Bettencourtová. 
A photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of famous will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for misuse of state weakness, which is a criminal offence for which a sentence in a maximum of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000. 
This decision confirms that the process actually takes place in a case that can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter challenge each other and the management of L'Oreal cosmetics empire. 
But 15 criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 leté Liliany Bettencourtové, which should make the College of three doctors. 
Heiress and the main akcionářka L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not on the terms offered prosecutors in Nanterre during the investigation. 
Doctors, who will be elected on Friday, should draw up a report on 10 March 2010 and at the same time to comment whether Liliane Bettencourtová could be in a state of weakness, and in which the period. 
I think that it will. 
I talk to her, said after the hearing Mrs Bettencourtové lawyer, Georges Kiejman. 
As the lawyer Francois Bettencourtové-Meyersové, Olivier Metznera, welcomed the court's decision. 
It's great news (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier) confirmed. 
Two years ago, the only daughter Liliany Bettencourtové launched criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, whom they blame for years of the weakness of her mother, in order to gain the gift of one billion euros in the form of cheques, contracts for life insurance or images masters. 
But Liliane Bettencourtová always refused, it would be a photographer, which considers long-term friend, manipulated. 
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of an action brought by Mrs Bettencourtovou-Meyersovou, Friday's the speech of lawyers are sometimes changed in the family hour of truth. 
Attorney Liliane Bettencourtové submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent his notaries, and in which expressed their distrust of her husband Françoisy Bettencourtové-Meyersové. 
In a letter from 2003, according to an attorney Liliane Bettencourtová adds: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote Banierovi for a period of 15 years, once or twice a day. 
Ever since you got married, I never talk ". 
The state prosecutor in Nanterre again found that negotiations stěžovatelky is justified, the more that, in these days of the judge rejected her request for the initiation of a proceeding to the issue of legal protection for her mother. 
Liliane Bettencourtová "is quite able to participate in the court, is not under the protection or in custody. 
No one else will act for her, "confirmed representative prosecutor, marie - christine Daubigneyová. 
Finally, the court decided that the validity of Mrs Bettencourtové-Meyersové expressed at the time of the opening of the process. 
Managerial revolution or the end of the economic intelligence? 
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence was unnecessary... 
For more than ten years of the behaviour of the management of large companies to the employees access business-to-consumer marketing before the revolution: it is about to co-identify themselves with the "values" identified from the mountain, as before, when it was necessary to impose the consumer products which the ideas of heads of factory technicians. 
The fact that the customer has become a centre of entrepreneurial companies marketing strategy, the conquest of the market in the right direction... Even if the authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, regularly returning! 
Passive approach employees can lead to fatal demoralization. 
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only visible part of a much rozšířenějšího general phenomenon, which affects mostly managerial cadres. 
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence. 
And, indeed, EI "requires all interested parties (...) active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires from the staff of the that are inconsistent with the revenue authoritarian management. 
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to include workers at the center of the interest of the company as well as a client. 
The relative usefulness of internal surveys. 
Internal polls - as the questionnaire submitted by the employees of the company Orange - will contribute to the revolution in management practices? 
Unfortunately I'm afraid not. 
Mainly because I convinced myself that in the face of the new situation, the structure of the various turning back primarily to the... What always did! 
Furthermore, because that authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, increases proportionately with the severity of their own failures. 
Finally, because most of the workers has simplified view of human behavior. 
Because they are graduates for engineers have mechanical interpretation of psychology. 
For the sake of convenience take the old behavioristickou theory, currently again highlighted "neurovědami" from the U.S. and widely disseminated without too much knowledge of the scientific institutes and the media. 
In fact, it is possible to move "levers" (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey agency Ipsos Figaro. Fr, which only strengthens the case management staff in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world. 
To identify and measure the factors mobilization. 
On the contrary, manažerská revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, for the final vision of human behavior. 
Lies in the integration of the basic insight into all projects and practice management: for the staff of the firm commitments will be possible only if they seem like a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects. 
Currently, this concept of the motivation of staff involved in the only study motivačně functional analysis. 
These studies have shown that evaluates their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxy, which will allow them to the images, which the company says, assess what offers them to implement their life goals. 
Thanks to identify and measure of these factors can mobilize to control, and on their "social performance" and its management of human resources "on the right path ". 
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence. 
The Oslo Accords: "just war" Obama praised by the right. 
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States. 
Conservatives, who initially ridiculed the award Obama 9 October, this time a presidential speech applauded, including Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in elections in 2008. 
I liked what he said, said Palin, muse right-wing Republican wings, for the USA Today, and added that she herself on the subject, "sometimes necessary" war expressed in his memoirs, which are based. 
The war is, of course, the last thing the Americans would like to have to, but it is necessary. 
There is a need to All the terrorists, he said. 
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its předchůdciGeorge W. Bush on Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send another 30, 000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before. 
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, said that the president did in Oslo, "a very good job ". 
I think that speech was very good, congratulated the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which particularly appreciate the president's mention of "the existence of evil in the world. 
In a way, I felt that the speech as fully historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio "the Takeaway ". 
The former member, whom some as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012, was delighted to see "leftist president," recalled to the members of the committee for the Nobel Prize, "that they would not be free and could transmit the price for peace, if the use of force exist. 
According to Michael Gerson, a former author of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama made "very American speech ". 
Not only is presented as a "cosmopolitan" as always, but "speaking as the American President" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble, which was created themselves, and that they don't do too much for it to her," said Gerson's. 
Among the few malcontents from the right belongs to the hawk Bush era, a former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, who has described as "dull, pompous and without inspiration ", as stated on the website of the National Review Online. 
The left of the president, for example, the democratic reprezentant Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama, justifies the use of force. 
"When the war packed into a container of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned. 
However, the press of the opinion of the President. 
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to be the Peace Prize Obama premature reviewed his output as "nadvýkon" and the speaker known for his talent. 
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decision in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression ", a California newspaper avidly. 
Obama "speech what was to be ", said the New York Times, and speech marked" for the simple and instructive. " 
Road carriers: three marathons to the agreement, which will save the supply of stocks at Christmas. 
After three negotiating maratónech ran out of road transport departments TLF, the only employers' organizations, which remained until the end, on Friday evening to the agreement, which ended the call to strike and the threat that hung over the supply of stocks at Christmas. 
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau at Friday's signing of the agreement expressed "joy" and that after several negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning. 
After the second night of discussions, negotiators on Friday morning broke with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning. 
And even though the three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) from the negotiations odstoupily. 
But it was the need for more than six hours of meetings, which began at 11 hours, all agreed and in 18 hours podepsaliznění agreement. 
This conflict "would be very hurt" and "threatened by the danger that will be narušeny holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau. 
The text includes wage increases of 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport). 
Hourly wage for the lowest salary increases from €8.72 to 9.06. 
It's not much, but it is a lot of effort, he explained Patrice Clos (FO). 
Tonight we'll give our members, in order to avoid blockades, no blockade of supply centres. 
But it can occur for a few opponents, who are not satisfied, "he said. 
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "good agreement ", although it was hard to admit to an increase of high salaries due to the international competition ". 
According to him, an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and about 100 to 120 euros for the highest. 
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement ". 
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT) is a "acceptable compromise ". 
The agreement also implies revalorizaci travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of the state road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the question of 13. salary and modernisation of collective agreements. 
Bussereau said "a reduction of 100 million in taxes on wages undertakings" which was the subject of the government on the draft law on the budget for the year 2009, which participated in the night from Thursday to Friday the National Assembly. 
The government will ask the Senate to "identical" vote. 
Signature allows that this agreement will apply soon as possible to businesses, which are members of the organization, and later in the field, in the case of the Ministry of Labor. 
Take place "as soon as possible," assured Bussereau. 
The whole process may impede only opposition employers' organisations. 
Organization FNTR speaks of "bad business" for 100 million euros "has already been offered in the sector, compensation part of the carbon tax." 
Secretary of State for Transport forced us to emergency meeting not as a result of mutual analysis, but the Super nerozhněval jedlíky turkeys at the time of the Christmas holidays, she complained Unostra. 
For the organization Otre threatens the agreement in the next 12 months "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field. 
RER commuter trains A: interruption of traffic on the weekend, trade unions with the proposals of the transport firm RATP. 
Interruption of transport on the line of suburban RER trains, which is the largest urban public transport in France, will continue over the weekend, because Friday's meeting between unions and management RATP second day of the strike did not lead to any specific results in the premium. 
On Saturday and Sunday, on the important purchasing the weekend before Christmas, trains run between 10 and 20 hour, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will run every second train, outside of this section only one train of four. 
The connection SNCF will be přerušeno in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train. 
Commercial houses Galeries Lafayette, which expect every day over 200, 000 customers welcomed the fact that "the RATP tried zajištěníspojení with large trade houses. 
Line RER and leads from the west to east of Paris agglomeration. 
The managed RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-Vallée. 
On Friday was in the peak operating one train of two, and virtually no souprava nejezdila during off-peak hours, as planned. 
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France and arranged for other platforms nevládl confusion. 
So early in the morning was in the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) far fewer people than usual, inter alia, also because it was lacking pupils and students. 
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he stood for "a hour and a half before, to be sure they arrive in time. 
The station was crowded, announced the state railway SNCF, predicted with a large number of ushers and guards. 
RER commuter trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or Cergy model-Le-Haut came or departed from the Saint-Lazare railway station with connection to the subway. 
Another striking General Assembly will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will evaluate the results of Friday afternoon meeting with management, trade unions, which rank as "weak ". 
The RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER trains and in all respects, the organization of working time, the career, etc. 
That is not, However, drivers who require a well-earned premium, according to Thierry Garona (OdboryJih). 
RATP even extended proposals about bonuses, which offend CGT, with the leadership "was not able to solve the problem, while travel carriers and SNCF it ". 
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "closer to review the conditions of the profession," stated RATP transport businesses. 
Which was the reason why trade unionists believe that the company "makes fun weekend travelers. 
In the morning hours about 150 drivers obsadilo Enterprise Committee In his Paris headquarters. 
Leadership, which until now rejected any discussion during the strike, therefore, in order to "comfort" opted for the meeting. 
The danger is that the conflict on Tuesday extend to line RER B, then what Unsa and independent shall notify stávkovou emergency. 
The unions call premium in value from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), indépendants (Independent)) and make it difficult to the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers. 
The Driver peri-urban trains RER earn in more advanced time career 2200 to 2700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros bonus for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and public holidays. 
The Turkish justice dismissed for the Kurdish side and this decision carries heavy consequences. 
Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday decided to cancel the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered a protest demonstration in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul. 
This decision could greatly complicate the task of government, which is trying to bring the Kurdish community a friendly hand to attempt to end 25 years of conflict.

The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (500). 
Party leadership has indicated before the verdict that members of Parliament rather than leave it served as members of without political affiliation. 
The decision is a continuation of a process initiated in 2007, the Court of Cassation prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkayem, which accuses the DTP of obedience to the "orders" Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries as a terrorist organization. 
Many observers believe that the DTP is legal political vitrínou rebels from the PKK. 
Page assures that the PKK has no "essential link ", but refuses to designate a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiating with it. 
The court's verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights and attempting to limit the support of Kurds against the PKK and end the conflict. 
DTP executives confirmed that the dissolution of the parties could lead to a renewal of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where degenerated in recent weeks, many demonstrations against the conditions under which the detained PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in clashes with the police. 
From the notification of the decision of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakiru, a big city in the southeast, which populated largely by the Kurds. 
The police used tear grenades and water cannon, the demonstrators threw again Molotovovy cocktails or fired stones from slings.

After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of justice "will deepen despair ". 
Turkey is not this question (Kurds, note. Red.) to resolve the ban, said in the press. 
The government, consisting of a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision. 
We are against the interference of the parties. 
It does not solve anything, said Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz. 
This decision is completely odstřelem Democratic proposals, which the government, said political scientist Ahmet Insel. 
Of course, we can wait reaction from the PKK, he said. 
On Thursday, the PKK alluded to one of the nejvražednějších attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed three days before seven soldiers. 
The new Silicon-Valley 
For years, as a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West. 
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was strictly guarded location, where there is a secret weapons research. 
Today, it is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, remote 37 miles from Moscow center, the "Russian Silicon Valley ". 
There are significant micro - and nanoelektronická research and manufacturing centers. 
Since September 2008 established zelenogradští contacts with representatives zelenogradští scientific Centre Riedberg - with university institutions and firms frankfurtského Innovation centres (FIZ). 
There has been a number of mutual visits and signed on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on close cooperation ". 
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow vícestarosta Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, head of the Frankfurt signed planning officer Edwin Schwarz. 
In 2010, they'll go FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research at a seminar in Zelenogradu. 
Scientific exchange 
This is an ongoing scientific exchange. 
But it is also about economic relations. 
FIZu companies will be allowed to implant in the growing Russian market. 
On the contrary, russia's scientific companies want to get the contract in Germany. 
Zelenograd is the major Russian research institutes and companies. 
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, large groups Sitronics and Rossijskaja electronics. 
District was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research. 
Zelenograd (literal translation of "Green City ") gained its name from the wooded hilly landscape, which are integrated research facilities. 
Stuttgartská brake 
Dimension Stuttgart 21 can not adequately prepare. 
For fans of the project is quite simply a "new heart of Europe ". 
Well. S21 is more than run the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital of Baden-Württemberg on one decade in a desperate building chaos. 
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the years. 
Hlavové station with the rails, which ended in the city center, was then considered to be technical fossils 19th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, because it was the need for enormously much time to přepřáhnutí locomotives back to the front. 
Go, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work. 
Therefore disappearing hlavová station: in Frankfurt and Munich. 
And in Stuttgart: transit station, which is roughly in the middle of the route of the trans-European rail magistrály between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe ". 
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 80 years are no longer compatible with reality. 
Themselves very ambitious designers know that the Hessen and Bavarian city's start construction of almost neufinancovatelné. 
Since then, as there are modern shuttle trains and motor vehicles at both ends, they don't have problems with zajížděním and vyjížděním. 
Yet: starts with Stuttgart 21, including a new track ICE to Ulm. 
It and local politicians. 
Working together, because of the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic by the taxpayer and no public concern. 
The project is still some way to apologize. 
A new urban space, which - if we believe the computer images projektantů - will contain many green. 
For rail transport system is S21 harmful. 
The station, and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980's - attributed the huge increase. 
Then there was no competition from cheap flights. 
Modern transport policy must go but primarily on the strengthening of freight transport, because rail transport is more environmentally friendly than freight car on the road. 
But the new line is not due to a sharp stoupáním suitable for freight trains. 
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects. 
In Švábsku should bury good six billion euros. 
This is the official number. 
Experts consider to be the real ten to 15 billion. 
It is clear that in the next decade will miss the finances for the next uzlové points and narrow space on the network. 
On the list of the ministry of transport is sixty larger projects. 
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 kilometers long route through the valley of the Rhine. 
Since 1987, on this route puts slow pace. 
There would need for a push. 
But S21 will be as a brake. 
The track Rhine valley will become hrdlem bottle international freight transport: Directly in the heart of Europe. 
The government is studying the judgment on the airport 
The provincial government left in the earth Wiesbadenském open, if he goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice (VGH administrative) regarding the ban on night flights and allow him to reconsider.

It is a difficult, if you can keep their word, "said the head of the green Tarek al-Wazir, referring to the election slogan FDP" We word We ". 
The minister rejected the criticism schäfer - gümbela, the provincial government tries to through "distortions rights and tricks" to get to their night flights. 
The precise legal control needs time. 
The coalition wants to work on the basis of "quick first impression." 
We need a realistic decision, he said Stefan Müller (FDP). 
Comments by his faction to ban night flights were never such as the opposition.

Speed Dial 
It was a faster than expected. 
Station introduced successor just two weeks after the administrative Board ZDF supplant from the office of the editor Nikolaus Brender. 
Last night to agree on that person. 
For the favorite was called Peter Frey, head of the studio in the capital city in Berlin. 
Station, but it has not been proven - officially to nepředbíhala process. 
But could also play a role that they would not harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schächtera, if this proposal for the board failed. 
Frey, Schächterův candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the. 
The result of the vote was not known before the close of this issue. 
Two weeks ago, foundered on the Administrative Board Schächter with its proposal to extend the Nikolaus Brenderem contract for another five years. 
For Brendera voted only seven members, seven were against him. Brenderova loss of mandate was for Schächtera bitter defeat, although she expected. 
Union's majority in the administrative Board of the signal for several weeks before the election, he does not want in office to confirm Brendera. 
Resistance to the editor organized hesenský Premier Roland Koch. 
He refused to remain in office highly weighted editor arguing that the Brendera fell quota monitoring news broadcasters ZDF. 
Until shortly before the election were therefore protests, in which was sharply criticized by political influence on ZDF. 
The last time in the debate vmísilo even 35 státoprávních lawyers who Kochův process heralded as unconstitutional. 
To no avail. 
The person 
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen. 
He studied politics, education and romanistiku. 
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau. 
1983 crossed Frey ZDF, first to "heute-journal ". 
Next stop: 1988 to 1990 personal referent, editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; in 1998, the head of the "Morgenmagazins "; in 2001, the head of foreign policy ZDF; since then, the head of the main study ZDF. 
After being Brender, who was on Wednesday elected a professional periodical Medium magazin journalist of the year, deposed, the Greens announced that the constitutional claim. 
Kochův opponent in the Administrative Board, rýnsko-falcký Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the Land would change the state contract with ZDF so that the staffing proposals could not be blocked by politically motivated majority. 
Beck but also refused to the exclusion of party politicians of supervisory boards ZDF. 
Brenderův presumed successor, Peter Frey, the Administrative Board ordered clever chess move - immediately after the toppling Brender panel criticized for it. 
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence could be nominated for the post of editor without losing face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the Administrative Board, without coming into the suspicion that he would be straník protlačen into office. 
In the of the party anyway Frey classified left-wing liberals.

In addition, should check the workload of learners, and should ensure "fair and obhajitelná rate ". 
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition tests between universities in Germany and abroad. 
The Federal countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural award for undergraduate and graduate study. 
The derogations should cease to exist. 
Less tests 
Since the beginning of the student protests in the worm had ministers of culture and university rectors winged words in the mouth of a better education. 
Now they are the first time filled with specific content. 
The so-called Accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests partly drastically zredukuje: "Each module will be only one test," writes in 30 - page report, which is partly regulate the approval of academic disciplines. 
"significantly lower examination burden," said the chairman of the Accreditation council Reinhold Grimm, is to be "stopped bad development that significantly limited the performance of the studio." 
The study should be "performance" in the future, "the decisive criterion" in the implementation of. 
Modules and content "must hard check" to "unnecessarily restrict student in the selection 
Seminars ". 
Students should "entitled to the space, which allows and encourages its own initiative ". 
The rules are to apply for approval of the new study, after a review, but also for the study. 
You need to be "přeakreditovat" every five years - which, however, means that it will take until 2015 before they checked all fields of study. 
Is responsible for around ten accreditation agencies, which are subject to accreditation councils established by the. 
The Ministers of Culture in October called "strongly" Land to the agency, so that the material was too large and the system was strict. 
In the individual countries have universities and colleges have agreed with terrestrial ministries on appropriate measures. 
As the only country Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process. 
The money should pay for the consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen the test and foreign offices. 
They want the country and high school to spend ten million euros. 
At the beginning of the year 2010 wants to submit to parliament amendments to the higher education law. 
According to the study by the end of the module should be required only a single test. 
The study should be more flexible, to be guaranteed recognition of tests from other universities and to facilitate the master's degree. 
By the end of next year should be inspected performance of all study subjects in the country. 
The government and opposition on Thursday again about the study conditions in the country. 
In addition to praise the fallen criticism of resolution. 
The Federal Board of directors Juso groups called for the creation of education policy neodehrávala in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university presidents. 
At the latest strike would "go to talk at least speak a word" students as of the person concerned. 
Future scholars also gained support from the president of the Conference of presidents of higher education (HRK), Margrety Wintermantelové: "We need the experience of students," said Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with which HRK advice on the common reform report. 
According to the trade unions Education and Science (GEW Bonn resolution) did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that everyone Absolventovi with bakalářským nástavbové title to allow access to a study. 
Second, to ensure that the Land for today's generation of students for undergraduate courses were tomorrow available enough jobs in the fields of study, with what the best conditions, said a member of the board of directors GEW Andreas Keller. 
The land must employ more speakers. 
Ministers of Culture, however, have free access to the Master's programs outlay. 
More than a footnote to Hertě Müllerové 
To get into and out of Germany's nice, almost no control... "is the opening line of a poem poet Werner Söllnera, which in this torn piece of with experience with přicestováním one dissident, who gained freedom, at the same time, but their language environment. 
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 v rumunském Banátu, he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as the one of the children's book publishing, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt am Main. 
He was awarded various literary prices, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 head of the Hesse forums literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt. 
The great commotion took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was a "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a cracked mirror its security act ". 
Obviously znejistělý and subdued Söllner left declaration in front of fellow writers Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Helmuthem Frauendorferem, admits to working as a secret informant Romanian secret service of the Securitate. 
Together with some of the present Söllner in 1989 German language prize. 
Attempts at recruiting apparently began quietly, first in 1971. 
I went Söllner, "so someone who did not sufficiently attempts to intimidation by the Securitate." 
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter. 
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize Hertě Müllerové and its bezpříkladným literary settlement mechanisms of dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly a community of German authors originating in Romania, shaken case that indicates the depths and appalling political system, which is based on control and špicování. 
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said, according to the state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but it is also a victim. 
In the acts Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after the award Söllnerově Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence on a secret agent Walter. 
"Vysekával" me in all the essential points for him, says Markel. 
Has a moral obligation to make this note. 
Söllnerovo statement was in this form and before this audience unexpected, but very surprising return of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not. 
Herta Müllerová wrote in July, when reading their own akta, 914 parties that Germany was a pleasant reservations for snoopers Securitate. 
Concerned, it can be assumed, will be to speculate, and in some cases, I know that name behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter. 
Otherwise than in the domestic, meanwhile, has become a some components of the Stazi is handling the estate checking Securitate very diffuse. 
In recent years, systematic education and punk restricted. 
One of the Birthlerových offices, which corresponds to the National Council for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded in 1999, the issue of the act was done since more lengthy. 
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of folders. 
That former members of the Securitate in Romania have still a big influence, showed after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hertu Müllerovou one conversation in which one of the former Securitate from Timisoara, commented on nositelce awards hostile. 
Has a psychosis, after all, was questioned only once. 
Potupení here quite openly expressed in the form of freedom of expression. 
Of course, that the case Söllner, as in the context of zamlčeným guilt, the inevitable questions. 
Why now? Who uškodilo? Specific responses to Söllnerovo return leaves to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than přiřknutí guilt and shame. 
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote. 
Saturated deposit Champions League 
It looked as if he came clean clothes sales representative from a Christmas party, the sporting goods sweets, when a quarter of a hour after midnight přivolaného Mercedes Class C new coach VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by orange-colored bag sponsor. ¨ 
The man with the bald spot for him after he left, even in a foreign city. 
Otherwise he could drive itself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with happiness was 55letý man also little. 
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow will continue to work. 
Or is it just begins. 
In the words of only three days committed Swiss messenger: "we have reached osmifinále ", in the Champions League thanks výhře3:1 over Unirea Urziceni in Romania," but we mustn't get oslnit success: It will be brutally tough fight against sestoupení. " 
"Far more important task" is in front of us on Sunday. 
It is important to repeat in Mainz performance of the royal class and in ordinary league date. 
And to avoid the obvious weaknesses after three quick gólech Maricy (5.), Träsche (8) and Pogrebnyaka (11). 
Sortition 
Osmifinále Champions League (match 16/17. + 23/24 February / retaliation match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will draw lots of 18 December in Nyon. 
The joy of třeskavého Babbelova successor will therefore maintained. 
Not only for the alleged healer, which uncertain stuttgartským professionals added during a short period of time, the willingness to deploy and joy of the game. 
I went to the players and told them that they focus on its strengths and I told them to be more daring, explained the healer souls Gross so simply denominated successful recipe, but for the presence of a therapist Babbela but no longer had any effect. 
Spurred some magic, he admitted Babbelův adherent Jens Lehmann, "when in football there's momentum, they are sometimes things that you did not as possible." 
A Sami Khedira, who after mnohatýdenní break caused by zraněním, became, thanks to its dynamism as the best player on the field, he tried to describe the "phenomenon" proverbial "fresh wind" and working procedures of the new manager: "He's a man who is a radical and requires discipline. 
This is what we need in the current situation. " 
For Babbela obviously missing. 
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports the President Horst Heldt 
VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability. 
As gross want neither players and managers overestimate the victory against weakened replacement and completely congested defense of the Romanian guest. 
I would have won in Glasgow than ugly awakening came after the defeat, 0:4 in Leverkusenu, consider Khedira. 
A sports President Horst Heldt reminded that they have achieved one objective in the season, but the other is still far away. 
We're not for water. 
That Heldt on its 40th birthday neslavil even after the first domestic victory after three months, was due to víkendovými events, which recently revived in the form of a television interview with goalie Jensem Lehmannem just before the start of the game. 
Decisions, which active others and not Jens, replied Heldt on hard Lehmannovu criticism. 
The board of directors of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure pubertálních fans. 
And that was canceled his day off after the game, Lehmann described as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy. 
Lehmannovy statements "formulates pure egoism," said Heldt and announced konsekvence for brankáře. 
Both forties will have probably no joy of life. 
In any case, the one with the other, that without work sesazeného trenérského team would not be so strong and combative players' performances. 
Babbel and his assistants were "a large share of success," says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with a plastic bag agrees.

Case Kundúz 
Frontal attack from opposition: the head of the green Jürgen Trittin called because of bad information about the affair Kundúz secretary of Defense Guttenberga a liar. 
The SPD and Linke (left) Chancellor invited to submit an explanation. 
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge to raid on the opposition Kundúz believes that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) made of deliberate deception. 
The Minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "knowingly false ", said the head of the Greens Jürgen Trittin in Saturday's news show ARD" Tagesschau ". 
Call it the usual expression: He lied. 
The order to the killing was issued in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF). 
This is the essence of the report, which was NATO, which had read Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin. 
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not only On the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban. 
In the American raid, which claimed the German commander Kundúzu Colonel Klein, according to NATO to kill or injury to 142 people. 
Green, the SPD and Linke called on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately expressed before the Federal and also clarify what he really knew Guttenberg about this event. 
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killings part of the Afghan policy - and, if the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and intelligence this new strategy, called Jürgen Trittin and colleague from the Green Party Renate Künastová. 
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism. 
The Office of Chancellor has no effect on the deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said. 
On Saturday, also loud doubts about the makeup of the Ministry of the background of the release of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhana and the Secretary of State Peter Wicherta. 
According to the information spiegelu informed both Guttenberg correctly and completely on the background of the attack on the tanker. 
It was said that they had to deny the existence of the reports of NATO and the Minister of sensitive details. 
From the vicinity of both top officials, however, that the Department of Defense even on several reports, among them the two-page document commanding Colonel Klein and one report of the military police. 
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" shall report that Wichert had meanwhile requested in a letter to clarify the situation. 
It is noted that has not yet received any response. 
Ministry on Saturday did not comment on complaints and pointed out that this will be addressed at the investigative committee of the council, which will be appointed next Wednesday. 
Worlds dreams 
Some see the images and voices that others see and hear. 
Not only mentally ill or drug intoxication merge the boundaries between imagination and reality. 
Until this occurs during sleep, everything is fine. 
If we lie to shut our eyes in a dark room, we surround the wildest imagination and fantazijními delusions. 
But who is experiencing a dream-like states, hear and see things that others see and hear, in today's the Western world majority for a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as eccentric. 
But such images and voices not only the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication. 
Blame is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there to take care of it, that the border between the dream and reality. 
Dreams altered state of consciousness may be present in various forms, at best, we call them a vision in the worst delusions. 
Even if the initiator and effect may vary, however, vision mystičky Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet new-age Carlos Castanedy, shamanic states of delirium, psychoses and hallucinations derived from similar processes. 
Hallucinations or visions arise when the derailment balance neuronálních brain - particularly dopamine, noradrenalinu, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed. 
A comprehensive hallucinations and wandering thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis. 
Gravity has no power over him 
The link between dreams and delusions of employed doctors and philosophers since antiquity. 
Aristotle understood as a form of a dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, said in 1861 "great similarity ravings with dream states, the Sigmund Freud was a dream even" psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusions, the senses. ". 
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. is amended in comic figure. 
His body is 2 - d and brightly colored. 
Gravity has no power over him, floating near the ceiling of the room. 
Feels the kick. 
Behind him the winged figures with blood red, cenící teeth. 
Chasing him, the heavy, fiery shoes, throwing him on the wall, feel pain throughout the body. 
Loud, evil voices from the walls and on the radio. 
We can not tolerate voices that curse and insult him. 
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, zauzlí into the loop and consolidate it on a hook on the ceiling. 
Stand up to one speaker and you can loop around the neck. 
Jumping. 
Loop permits. 
A chorus of voices tearing his eardrums, "go to the clinic and let yourself!" 
Today's Henning T. 40 years, has seen six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago. 
They were running LSD. 
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoická psychosis, it is also, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia. 
He learned to live with their disease, three years is married. 
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, he says. 
The ghosts are a reality 
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is of the second most commonly treated illnesses. 
In acute disability usually schizophrenic psychosis can not distinguish between internal and external world, into přebuzeného condition, which can lead to halucinacím, velikostním, vztahovým or the illusion of persecution. 
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that Command, comment or maintain dialogue. 
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon. 
The affected is unable to distinguish important from nedůležitého, the brain can not filter out spurious signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions. 
Like a dream opens the floodgates flooding psychosis of ideas and fantasies, which come from the deepest layers of consciousness. 
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief veterinarian Clinic general psychiatry University Clinic in Heidelberg. 
A schizophrenic is located in the center of the stage, everything is important směřovaný at him. 
At the same time, into a passive role, it becomes, like a dream, overwhelmed by events and can actively shape. 
It is therefore often feel threatened, and manipulated. 
Comparison with reality is not usually possible with them, they are a terrible reality, awakening is out of the question. 
Once in a lifetime experience hallucination 
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but still sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, fundamentally zachovaná." 
Wandering thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to alienation experience in real framework. 
Scientists are still a puzzle as to why our brain is doing exactly the sort of stuff. 
The exceptional conditions for each person can lead to lose in the short-term relationship to reality, says Fuchs. 
Not everyone, however, develops into psychosis. 
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor. 
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have minimal brain damage. 
We believe that in the early stage of development of the damage to the brain, such as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs. 
But it remains a puzzle, as there is a malfunction neuronálního system, which in the long years does not materialize. 
The role of the effects of the neighborhood - stress or traumatic experiences can be iniciátorem psychózy, if it is to her disposition. 
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because the transmission system. 
When our brains zavař 
Crazy is that psychotronici suffers hallucinations, and to get rid of them, and swallowed expensive, others give money for drugs to be obtained, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck. 
If the images we perceive as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of attitude. 
Kasten collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and, in the last year interpreted their results in the book "Die Welt irreale in unserem Kopf" (unreal world in our head). 
Although hallucinations belongs to a typical accompanying phenomena psychoses, but also to the surprisingly many other diseases. 
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression also often diseases like a migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma. 
Surprisingly, under certain conditions halucinuje himself healthy person's brain. 
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, of the contents of ideas, which are normally suppressed. 
When part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are too active or little repressed; if our brains, or when there is a lack of stimulation. 
Drugs can run this state as well as brain damage or psychosis. 
But also the withdrawal of incentives, stress, worry about love or other more exceptional states. 
In the most recent studies gave up to one-third of respondents that at least once in your life experienced hallucination. 
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the grammar school. 
In fact, completely normal girl. 
If there were not those shapes and voices. 
The breaks may be that it will appeal kolohnát with long, dark hair. 
When he replies, looking at her classmates with surprise - no one except her see and hear this boy. 
This shy girl as stiff dreamer, but Sarah K. nesní, knows it. 
He's awake, hears and sees the boy, just as they hear and see the girl sitting next to the bench. 
Even can feel his presence, at least for a few moments. 
It's a nice feeling, has the boy. 
I'm crazy?, asks. 
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears. 
In the night are rather depressing. 
They are often Delusions burden. 
When sitting in class, can not how many times monitor teaching, because a teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains all other audible and visible on the board of the mathematical equation. 
In the night of phenomena rather depressing. 
While waiting in a dark room to sleep, which is rarely and too late, often can not, if he's awake or asleep, if the, that he sees, or a girl with bleeding wounds on from the hands and feet are open or closed. 
Leave me alone, shouting at the figures. 
Parents and friends say anything about it, thought it about her, that's crazy. 
The autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old. 
Last year did high school graduation and lives with her boyfriend. 
A year ago, hallucinations stopped. 
Since she contacted on the internet psychologist Kasten knows exactly that crazy. 
Delusions are also the art of despair 
If someone is socially isolated or he is removed incentives will likely hallucinations, says Kasten. 
I believe that the brain then does not have enough employment and old himself for his own amusement. 
Sarah K., an only child, she was a little girl fear of other children, often play itself. 
Her hallucinations began when in 13, she learned that the man who says dad since she thinks is her own father. 
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that process also real images and sounds, is for the disabled as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from delusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality is there shows. 
Hallucinations are also the images that will the brain, therefore work so real. " 
Also The dreams evaluates Kasten as a form of hallucinations. 
Hallucinations healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucinations in acute psychosis. 
Unlike schizofrenikům are mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic. 
Kasten advises therefore patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability. 
Border state between dreams and hallucinations 
In our world concentrated too much on the consciousness is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, the majority patologizován, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief Psychiatric and psychotherapy Clinic-Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf. 
Psychosis is heavy, útrpná disease, but it also provides the positives, creativity - a mirage is also the art of despair. 
The so-called oneiroidní form of experiences, a special form of the Amended consciousness to dream. 
Oneiroidní states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which is considered to be the real and can not be distinguished from waking. 
Oneiroidní state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as hepatitis polyradikulárním patients who experience fully conscious motor paralysis. 
When one is threatened by the loss of the world and herself, to be continued, the complete inability to move, replaced by the real situation of their own, an imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard. 
The type of border state between dreams and hallucinations. 
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change in the worlds, the real situation but zpřítomní the idea. 
Intensive form of aid senses and the transfer of the senses in an intolerable situation, which allows people to their own ability to shape, in an instant loss of consciousness. 
Everything is real, and later in memory 
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen oneiroidní describes his experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Replacing heart) as a rescue souls. 
He was 49 years, when, after the heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation published his consciousness on a few days, with his body lay motionless in intensive care. 
Claussen plunged into a world that he created, visited foreign time and place: the old man upoutaným on the bed, in the train the sanatorium, the robot guarding his health. 
He lives in the early Middle Ages between, which produces the narcotic substances from the blood. 
On the bike he kidnaps Řek to their homeland, in a hospital bed in the Alps, and meets the Korean mobster. 
Completely immersed in an imaginary wrong, everything is real, and later in memory. 
These internal path for Claussena fundamentally different from any dream. 
The dream is a different status, describes his experience. 
In contrast to dreams are memories of those mental pathways across the years and In nepodstatných details clearly obvious. 
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience. 
The intensity of this experience is smashing the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard. 
After all, show oneiroidní states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also awake our internal images of external reality. 
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, "may lead to distortion of what we call reality." 
The fact that may also be enriching. 
Snow may come 
Burda 
In the 27 to take over the children. 
The new head of publishing Kallen is a temporary solution: long-term wants to Hubert Burda to his business into the hands of their two children, said der Spiegel. 
Holding has also in the future include 100 percent family. 
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the long term in the hands of their children. 
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the company, says the man 69letý Spiegel. 
Details are to solve carefully. 
The question of whether they are also active in the company, is considered later. 
The question of whether to have the skills. 
It is not possible to take the lead in 7500 employees their children if they are not sufficiently capable of. 
That would be killed as children and business. 
Burda on Thursday announced that from January withdraws from the presidency of the Board of directors, and appointed as his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen. 
52 years a Member of the board of directors since 1999. 
First, he was in charge of technology. 
Later, with the Cashier section added responsibility for the company's assets and the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera also direct marketing, Foreigners, printing and Finance. 
For the first time in publishing, none of the members of the family. 
Burdovým children is 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, which today was 42 years old, died a few years ago. 
The appointment of kallena also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," said Burda. 
Holding should in future include 100 percent family, says Burda. 
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler With Burda expressed that neither family businesses do not have confidence in the run-off: "it has always companies that have been infected by the desire of capital, which have speculated and thought that they could become big players. 
It has never been my strategy. 
He never had "dreams of a world power," says Burda. 
As a political preceptor of the country, as was Springer, and I do not want to play the World League with "Time ", these shops are too big. 
Promise FonPeek 
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to explore the mail, without the ability to view a type of attachments or surfing in the network. 
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US, when Time magazine as one of the products of the year. 
It is difficult to see him out there, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people. 
Unlike smartphonů Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount payable, for example, the data plan iPhone. 
After his success, the company has started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, second on the basis of permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay for Peek six changes amount. 
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday to try Le Web, is the European version of the invention, and at the same time, his third transformation. 
Is limited, as well as his American counterpart, but brings a surprise. 
Monthly cost for maintenance is around 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe. 
The People passengers smartphonem already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently search café with WiFi (or Fon), so they can see the mail. 
The idea of roomingem at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be introduced a long time ago. 
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics in order to understand them, and also very good glasses to read a miniature letters. 
The European Commission has requested to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect. 
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state. 
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (interestingly, still has the name Fon when there is no WiFi) accomplishes this type of fare, means that operators are beginning to think differently, and considering the various offers, kterýmiby kompenzovali your data network. 
Kindle is another nice example, offers downloads of books and other searches on the Internet. 
No contract, no complications. 
This device is connected and paid for the purchase, rather than for months. 
And that's exactly what I expect that one is in případěFonPeek, it is a possibility to purchase permanent access as the Peak has already established in the US.

Color, kterouzbožňuje Michelle 
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color First Lady. 
For Barack Obama for the emergence of U. S. president chose a dress and coat in this colour, the same color can also be chosen when accompanying him on the second most important moment of his life: the transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. 
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition, it is a similar color - lime with třpytivými efekty-, in both cases, it was a three-piece ensemble - clothes, jacket and coat from the same látky- garnished with a large embroidery or a collar.

75% of working mothers to work problems associated with maternity. 
Discrimination in employment in recent years has increased, especially in younger women, which they intend to buy a child. 
This is the result of the study "fertility and working career Spanish women" by the CSIC, in cooperation with the Institute of women. 
The study surveyed 9737 women aged 15 to 75 years, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited options in the labour market because of motherhood. 
The study points out that at the beginning of the partner co-existence are many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment. 
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, starting with a partner to live before, previously gave birth to their first child and generally have more children. 
From the other side, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector partner coexistence and motherhood delay, and have fewer offspring. 
"women from 35 to 49 years with stable jobs have their first child at an average of 3.7 years from the beginning of living with a partner. This number is 4.1 in the case of women, kterédosažení his stable job, the greater part of his life, and thus have had to postpone the partner cohabitation and the arrival of children. 
The type of the profession has also a strong influence on maternity, although less influence on the opening of living with a partner, "explains Margarita Delgado, which is devoted to research in the CSIC. 
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of the marriage anarození child is the degree of education. 
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child. 
The differences are also among the women of the same generation. 
For example, in the age group 35 to 49 years of women with the basic and higher education given birth of her first child at the age of 25, 1. 
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education. 
Women with basic schooling to marry and gave birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with a medium or high education act opposite prefer to obtain a stable employment, before marriage and the birth of the first child, "says Delgado.

Cowardly aggression 
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother through our neighborhoods, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed kolemní and our dog, crosses saved from the shelter weighing more than six pounds, without a word it twice and kicked severely wounded. 
Our indignation is all the more that we do not see anything funny in such aggression against small and helpless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash. 
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when he encountered on a walk with these individuals began to worry about his own safety, since such a devil man who think of animal is able to do the same as a woman, child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself. 
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood. 
Dog all day. 
Of course, we have lodged a complaint to the nearest police station, but that it was, and to a delicate issues, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationality. 
Outrage forced us to this fact announced. 
We don't understand what is happening with today's youth, when they talk that troubled defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship. 
We do not understand, where's the proper manners, respect for animals and people.

The company Michelin indicates that this campaign is part of their obligations regarding the transport safety, which "means more than design and produce even safer products ", and confirmed that trying to fulfil this purpose and otherwise, i. e. in the form of training and information campaigns. 
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan "to be or not to be" is the first phase, when to more than 500 motorcycles will be deployed fixed boards to get to the awareness of the general public.

The sale of light commercial vehicles 
After nearly two years, the market is starting to light commercial vehicles. 
All 9.425 vehicles registered in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what's more, this is the first increase after 22 months of decline, according to figures patronátní Anfac Ganvam organization of producers and retailers Ganvam. 
The positive data, however, is better to put in quarantine since November 2008 is very bad period for comparison and a 60% reduction compared with the previous year. 
The consequence is that, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months are 40% less than in the previous financial year. 
Since January was prodáno95.853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick upy, supply, less freight cars and light trucks / bogies. 
Even the gloom which the most damaging demand, even if it is bought by private persons, most of the purchases were made smaller and medium-sized firms and almost 100% of cases, the financing through third parties. 
The limitations arising from the conclusion of bank credit is to be added and other factors such as the cessation or continuation of bad economic situation. 
In this situation, unlike coaches, support for the purchase of 2000E too. 
In addition to private individuals, it is to be noted iosoby business to business license small and medium-sized businesses, which they intend to buy a light utility vehicle to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed. 
Just yesterday from Ganvamu again, that is the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles and also and industrial vehicles (trucks and buses). 
The vendors assumes that in 2010 will be to a similar as last year, according to calculations, the sale of passenger cars and 4x4 falls on 19%. 
Support system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment. 
As in the case of antiblokovacího ABS system, that the ESP stability control, auxiliary systems manual brake, it all becomes compulsory fitting of European cars. 
In fact, already form part of the compulsory equipment all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is determined by the deadline for the removal of the lack of, which is February 2011. 
The measures introduced in the EU aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians, while it works so that it can help to avoid the many collisions. 
The hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency case, the system detects when the driver presses. 
But not always able to keep the pressure until the end. 
According to a study carried out by an automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident, nesešlápli brake before the collision, and half of them did not exercise the full power brakes. 
When 1.100 accidents 
On the contrary, this assistance requires brzdicího system maximum, reducing the stopping distance of the vehicle. 
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, it could prevent up to 1 100 fatalities per year related to pedestrians. 
Reducing this number will be even more marked-from calculations in order to prevent one of the four accidents with the person-after the introduction of so-called intelligent systems handbrake. 
In this case, the vehicle fitted with a system that (using radar or cameras) captures the obstacles and reports that the driver, except for light braking. 
If the driver responds, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if it is needed. 
If the driver does not react, even If the collision can not be avoided, what impresses most intense installations on the brakes and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.

GM, on the contrary, assures that the decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in these days.

It also offers with dvouspojkovou PDK gearbox, It was tested a vehicle with manual řazenou šestistupňovou speed, mainly on the second class in California, the mountain areas with many complex curves. 
His behavior may be regarded only as inviolable. 
Reduction in weight does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt. 
Rather, on the contrary: we no longer netestovali so small and light model, which is at the same time a safety in the movement in the bend, even at high speeds. 
It's a little athlete able to warm up the muscles in the short run, for a period of time until he nenařídíme sprint, braking, and the use of the engine. 
Whatever we want. Thanks to the procedure, which is so communicative as accurate, Whatever naznačíme hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do. 
And it with surgical precision. 
The sound of the engine according to the will of 
Sound V6 boxer, 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is a master-and it is possible to exaggerate the option "sport" and the system, which modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used for Panamery. 
Capacity acceleration is brutal, whether in the suction or recovery. 
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable. 
Asphalt roads, which we pass with Boxster Spyderem, was quite damaged, but the car well teach potholes. 
Electronic support was during the journey almost useless; and while we are in some corners came at dawn on námrazu gravel and even in the late afternoon. 
This ultra-light car is one of the funniest on the market, since it was something more than a mere modification Boxster S. 
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010 for cenu70.831 euros.

Thank you 
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, again on the market uncertainty, which should come as no surprise, because it is already natural state in an environment where managers take a decision on the future, which itself is uncertain. 
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was the liquidation of debt by direct purchase of assets and indirect release liquidity at a rate close to zero, the financial institutions could buy assets to the deduction. 
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets, has virtually ended, and without doubt its disparate policy of liquidity, are beginning to throw some sand into the gears, as it has made the Spanish central bank, with its auctions last year. 
Investors therefore challenge the ability of the world economy to keep the economic recovery without the heterodox measures, and we participate in the return of the risk reduction benefits. 
The stock exchanges and differences dluhopisůspolečností regain points, although they are still very remote abnormal levels, which reached at the beginning of the year. 
States were forced to socialize private risk, which has re-offended public debt. 
Again, the pressure on the quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the selected investors, thereby expanding differentiation of the euro countries to Germany. 
Spain this instability almost was affected, but at that time came, Standard Poor's and threatened a new revision of the reduction skills Kingdom of Spain. 
On the other hand, some uncertainty is useless for mute supporters of moral hazard, who again tried to pose to the conscience of the persons responsible for the world's economic policy because of the devastating consequences of reducing the loan on employment, when in fact it would be to declare a new. 
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the Emir to restore power in Emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen before. 
The government, which covers the deficit, the election and the new government is. 
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso. 
It Does not make sense to Ecofin saving Hungary from failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow member countries of the euro has its obligations. 
But what makes sense, is that the Ecofin forced the Greek government to transparency and of its own citizens to a shared responsibility for the necessary emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances. 
If, as we expect, we are before the normalization of the transitional risks, after some of the positions would be in anticipation. 
In the Spanish case, while our differences in the public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry about. 
If the European differences will be reduced and our further expand, it would be a typically Spanish risk. 
The Standard Poor's is an anecdote. When our leading indicators of forcing the majority of to anticipate the renewal of its scenarios and revise its scenario 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, for the Spanish economy it foretells a great chance to the survival of the with this warning. 
Once Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the being "careful, pal drivers.
