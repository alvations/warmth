Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners 
Scneelose Pisten Sorgenn make not only the giant mountains-local residents. 
The lack of snow discourages people from appointment of Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions. 
It can Therefore in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
Our pages are often visited. 
The People go through the offers, the prices, but now they have fear, binding. 
And if they call us immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "Matsch" will be the operator of the information portal Spindl. Info, Martin Jandura. 
Who the New Year's Eve-stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the appointment. 
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days. 
The Spindelmühle hotel owners offer now for the Silvestertag mostly only Wochenaufenthalte. 
I think that they are still for a while will seek to sell it, but then you also have to give in, and for shorter periods. 
And then the free room quickly dwindling, Jandura. 
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi. 
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out. 
In our offer is about half the seats are still free. 
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas visits to the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert. 
The Silvestertag in Giant can offer The Vrchlabi-travel agency, but there are fewer free seats. 
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average. 
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by that in Giant always no snow. 
The People are waiting to see whether snow falls. 
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow. 
Should the runways within a week verschneit, will also be sold out this Christmas, says Schiefert. 
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, manages the rooms in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou. 
We are about five percent better than in the previous year. 
On Silvestertag and Christmas we only have a few free rooms. 
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February, the business also run well, the director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada. 
About 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays is also the Omnia Hotel in central parking in Janske Lazne occupied. 
Remains to Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds free. 
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60 percent occupied. 
A little weaker is now the February, but at the moment, when the snow comes, is the interest in the periods spent in Giant, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch. 
On a more snow mess the Giant hotel owners now. 
On Thursday it should cool and if it comes to rainfall, should be snow On the mountains. 
But then again, a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove. 
United States: repetition is mother of wisdom 
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself for the most stupid. 
When he finally his anxiously awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it emerged that he abschrieb this on the Kopierpapier from the Bush-Iraq Szenariovor three years ago. 
Not only that, in the text itself, used the phrase "as in Iraq ", he has even used the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration:" New Vorwärtsweg "without the fence. 
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in Iraq troubled by the civil war - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision ". 
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military outgoing Bush strategy is the only possible and was very successful, that we in the news about Iraq no longer speaks. 
The Bush's reputation has not improved by objectively, because he has his successor a much dankbarere starting position as it was to be expected. 
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly. 
In order to increase the contingent have asked the military, especially the Oberkommandeur the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten vacillating harshly criticized in the White House. 
He called for 40, 000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better. 
The President postponed three months, but with no better idea and he has betrayed The General wenistens about 10, 000 soldiers. 
From Europe, he has the promise of another 5, 000 pressed, even though he himself, at least. 
Highly problematic about the whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama Doctrine leaves more questions than answers. 
Some doubt that the cut increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq. 
Despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society relatively well structured, their leaders pay tribute to the values. 
The Afghan situation is characterised by the cons indication - can rely on no one and there are no agreements. 
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their mind. 
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, that leaves only bogus construction, behind which the patriarchal Stammbeziehungen will make further out. 
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex. 
The building of a "strong state ", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic. 
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism 
Over the last eight years has worsened the situation in Afghanistan and now it is on the verge of explosion. 
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cries on the "Frühheimkehr" broke out here is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, is not influenced by facts. 
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of troops sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat. 
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out. 
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to their constituents, in which the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush gebirgsvorland. 
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran. 
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops. 
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation. 
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, fallls would prove to be a total loss. 
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses more in cash 
The chief executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs this year received no bonuses more in cash. 
The company has announced that the to the sharp criticism of its pay practices. 
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, but they can sell in five years. 
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn in the case, if they act too risky. 
Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the premium bonuses of Wall Street with long-term performance. 
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction is aware, in which she has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott. 
The problem is in the details, he added. 
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she had for the first three quarters of this year, almost 17 billion dollars for Prämienboni had set aside. 
The total amount of bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency also, despite the measure exceed $20 billion. 
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue. 
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of bankers who exceed the 25, 000 pounds, unique with a tax of 50 percent. 
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

The last Laureatin the Nobel Prize for economics, the American, Elinor Ostrom and her fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report. 
The only specialist category, in which no woman in this year, received a Nobel Prize in physics. 
This prize today, the scientists Charles Kao for research in the glass fibre-area and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl for the CCD-chip-invention, which is the basis of all Digitalkammeras, fax machines or astronomical Fernrohre. 
Each prize has the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certificate on the acquisition of the prize money. 
The totals in each category of ten million Swedish kronor.

Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him into the castle 
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning at the finance minister, Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form of this by the Assembly on Wednesday was released, does not agree. 
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the themes of the Friday meeting. 
The budget will also criticised by Klaus. 
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which deepened the crisis in public finances. 
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat. 
On its future remain in his role Janota on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate. 
After the Budget bill, which is now receiving Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor. 
In Parliament, but on Wednesday on the Left for monetary upheaval and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers. 
The government has concealed the proposals of social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit. 
Between the Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal Party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the cabinet, on which the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring. 
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures practically liquidated by the Fischer- government have been imposed in the autumn, and the public debt. 
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances have neglected, a longer period of time. 
In his opinion, there is no good solution. 
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties could build. 
The ODS, Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence. 
The deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK said that the concept of official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works. 
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a "strong worry ". 
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek-words that the budget deficit is that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kronor. 
On Wednesday, the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success. 
The People's Party was satisfied. 
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman 
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene" of the world, much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was filled by an American actor. 
The story tells of sport, Rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela. 
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar-actor, Morgan Freeman. 
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could represent him in Eastwood- film. 
A further important role Matt Damon. 
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you. 
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the Eastwood-drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby ", was already the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from the slave owners, a fictional U.S. president, and God in" Evan omnipotent ", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela. 
The former South African statesman was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison. 
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was president of the country. 
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen ", and at the same time, is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875. 
The requirement was to speak, as he 
The film recounts a real moment, the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically divided. 
He believes that he can agree people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players in the world, the outsiders. 
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995. 
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela-history on the cinema screen. 
He had no objective other than to play this role so this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, said Freeman. 
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he. 
The actor said, if he and the world leaders in the same country would be, he would try to meet with Mandela, with him to eat and, in his speech to be behind the scenes. 
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand. 
I have noticed that when I say the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said. 
For me, it is important to become a different person. 
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed. 
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world. 
It was a great surprise for him, as he Pienaar met for the first time in his house. 
I remember when I rang the door bell rang that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: "in the film, I see a lot more from ". 
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has headed by director East Wood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar. 
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "this was a very good story, very well ausgeführter film." 
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes. Com, has Invictus 76 percent positive evaluations. 
Light secret on Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a missile 
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin. 
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested. 
The launch was not successful and as a type "Bulava missile, which was originally the pride of the Russian army should be, is becoming a nightmare of Russian Generalität and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. 
Even His repeated presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights. 
Bulava is usually not at all or damaged in the air. 
In Russian newspapers already on "Bulava" than a "missile, which flies." 
A missile, which flies, but not 
This already 13th attempt at the beginning of normal. 
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the rocket. 
Presumably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage. 
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which under the water of the White Sea. 
This Raketentyp allows the shooting down of the submarine. 
It is therefore likely that the caused by an unspecified fliegendes object mysterious light on North because actually damaged "Bulava" was. 
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket. 
The Generalität has diesesmal challenged and claims that it cannot speak clearly from a failure. 
The first two stages of the rocket fell, and the accident was only the third stage. 
In the previous cases were damaged the engines in the first stage. 
Even if no test launch without error, the head of the Defense Department considers only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful. 
The nearly 50% success met with optimism and so the generals will continue to claim that the "Bulava" even without problems will fly and even to ten hyper-noise-nuclear warheads with a total weight of Max. 1.15 tonnes.

Because of frequent overtime, the union announced the strike on Monday. 
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek. 
The board wants but with the trade unionists still on a Saturday classes this week.

Czech discovery: a substance that also tempered like steel 'HIV viruses works 
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds, which the spread of HIV virus in the body to prevent. 
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses that are resistant to drugs. 
This fact against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong as one of the existing medicines. 
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured. 
The patients, the drug combination but can prolong the lives and prevent the propagation of the HIV virus in the body. 
But their income will be accompanied by a whole series of side effects. 
Incomplete suppression of the virus reproduction also has the development. Resistentviren sg, against the no medicines more effective. 
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences, CR from the VSCHT (chemically-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way how to deal with the virus-resistant. 
They have proven that the substances known as Metalokarborane on the protein substance, which is responsible for the of HIV Viruses. 
The Metalokarborane are links of boron and hydrogen, carbon and cobalt. 
These compounds block the virus reproduction in other ways than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem. 
In their work, the scientists to new 'improved' compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the Molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viral protein substance. 
The Metalokarborane have an unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor, hydrogen and carbon atoms and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked. 
Heinous and constant virus 
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, for the life cycle of the virus is essential. 
Without the HIV caused by the HIV Protease division would not mature infectious virus particles. 
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the scientists in the press report, the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR. 
In the work in the Science newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe whole rows of compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then systematically further. 
A little weaker, but reliable 
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne tested in place, even against their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV-infected patients. 
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten, against the medicines are often ineffective. 
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective drugs against HIV research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences. 
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the Fights Back 
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider their continued existence. 
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong worry ". 
It is time for the analysis. 
The deputy ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works. 
After Necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order to remain in office through the Parliament left. 
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas pointed out. 
Parliament has on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party-amendments on more than 12 billion kronor. 
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers. 
The government has concealed the proposals of social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit. 
The Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor. 
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of Budgetprovisoriums Frase not clear. 
Frustration and futility 
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation. 
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different. 
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier. 
He has indicated that he will remain in office. 
Reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of budgets. 
To what extent for the fight with the budget deficit, Necas, according to the Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget had prevailed in the government to do nothing. 
The Premier should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit-boosting laws, for example, sick pay and pensions or the service. 
Topolanek: The ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not 
This is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the entire government. 
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek in a text message from the United States. 
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people sit on top 09 who voted against the budget. 
Necas stressed that, if fishermen in favour decides to the fight against the deficit-level of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in Parliament ". 
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens of Democrats. 
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said of the citizens of Democrats nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak the journalists in Parliament. 
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels. 
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister. 
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the citizens of Democrats explicitly ask that they allow the adoption of the budget. 
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic has been pushed back. 
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking. 
As I withdrew to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of everything would be positive, Topolanek itself.

The railway praises the system, it is not to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets. 
To changes, it is only in one-day closed-door Netzfahrscheinen CD Net and favourable Internetfahrscheinen eLiska. 
For passengers without the customer card will be the price CD Net of 450 kroner to 600 kroner. 
The price eLiska will depend on the frozen Stecke, until now, he was for travel between any Bezirkstädten uniform and cost 160 kroner. 
Philippine milli aunt take more than 50 people, the children have been released. 
Millitante kidnapped today in the south of the Philippines 75 people, including some primary school pupils and their teachers.

Jancura collects complaint for libel against three head of the CSSD. 
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura today for libel cases against three social-democratic leaders. 
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik. 
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal. 
The complaint is linked to the efforts of the company, the regional trains in some districts. 
All regions, but ultimately the long-term contracts signed with the Czech railways. 
All three heads are attacking us and say that we take the cherries, we have the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them. 
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways, because we know the prices of the Czech railways, were completed last week. 
So we have no choice but to defend us. 
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said Jancura radio Journal. 
At the same time he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law. 
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission. 
Hasek, the collection of the complaint for further continuation of the Medialshow of Jancura him as free advertising for his company and for his own person. 
Of course, I am prepared my good name and reputation in my district to defend, and I would urge other head on.

The campaign has launched Jancura after the districts at the behest of the regional rail transport agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a High at 150 billion kronor no invitations to tender. 
After Vancura such behaviour is illegal and incompatible with the requirements of the European Court of Justice. 
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a member of the CSSD. 
The only threat was, if we do not that we can lose the Buslizenzen. 
He was a Member of the CSSD before, I know who they are, I am not saying his name, said the radio Journal Jancura today. 
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily 
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual. 
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary. 
But now voices that the mandatory-vaccination would be more effective. 
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate. 
The medicinal institute already set the maximum price of vaccines, which have to pay for health insurance. 
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure. 
New vaccination 
Free vaccines for August-children 
From January children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born. 
The condition st that they have not received a vaccine dose. 
Anyone with the vaccination in the last year or earlier has begun, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself. 
The first dose of vaccine should be between 3 and 5 month of life of the child. 
Already last year, a quarter of the families against Pneumokokken vaccinate their children. 
The parents paid 1, 600 crowns and more for a dose. 
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required. 
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses of 300, 000 to 450, 000 kroner per year. 
They save but in the treatment, the children without vaccination would need. 
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around 500, 000 per year. 
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package. 
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning. 
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years. 
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty-vaccination of children against Pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries. 
Will the vaccine be mandatory? 
At the same time, said that this vaccine could be in the future. 
From January this by insurance paid and voluntary. 
The compulsory vaccination would be better mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky. 
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination. 
The experts at the international conference, which was involved in our association, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination. 
This is not ideal. 
On the other hand, we are pleased that we succeeded, at least. 
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky. 
The Ministry of Health wants but The vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken not change. 
In this moment, we are considering not At all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen. 
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say The doctors. 
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks. 
If all children were vaccinated, it could be on the reduction of Wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine launched a voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova. 
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents their infants against Pneumokokken inoculated from next year. 
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is groundbreaking, that the first to land Vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not by the state. 
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova. 
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves. 
This is a concern of the practical children doctors, the purchase of vaccines. 
After the initial project vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and doctors then in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state. 
Some Members feared that the insurance so "the money from the health insurance could ". 
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and must wait until the insurance companies pay for them. 
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners to invest 40, 000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum. 
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.

Islam Can be French? 
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. 
At a time when the Swiss voters for a ban on building minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe can be integrated and. 
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French no Headscarves love" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves ") (2006) read, an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue, which divided the country one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still visible. 
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum. 
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening on the field. 
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free" offer. 
He is a good listener, He gives debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most. 
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall (or both)? 
Should young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals? 
A Muslim woman Can marry a non-Muslim man? 
Is It permissible for a Muslim to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage? 
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media. 
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholars and academics. 
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the other hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society. 
They do not have all the arguments on their side. 
The Conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam. 
The thinkers and activists, Bowen, are at odds with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia - which is a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims. 
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible. 
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides. 
He queries whether French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) really committed to pluralism. 
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who make their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism had to make. 
He sees a "tightening of the screws" as a growing pragmatism. 
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet ". 
The trostloseste outlook of the world 
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth. 
The ice is melting at an alarming rate and takes life that can survive anywhere else. 
Oil, gas, Schifffahrts and fishing interests have in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake. 
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, paints in "on thin ice" (original title: "on thin ice "), a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bears. 
In the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiserforscher who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears. 
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as brave 14 - year-old Fähnrich sea, only with his rifle butt Muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true. 
Young bears, as they have been caught behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were recently killed in zoos and circuses. 
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision. 
Even today Zooanlagen still typically a millionth of the life of wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: the Eisbär in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his skin.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often to the threat, the hunters for the survival of the species. 
Although in Norway, America and Russia, the Erlegen in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and engine sleigh-travelling Inuit powerful assault rifles, in order to bring their prey on the route. 
Ironically, in the waters in the north of this two hunting nations the ice longest remain. 
In his new book "after the ice" (original title "after the ice ") offers Alun Anderson, a former editor of science magazine new Scientist," a clear and disturbing description of the science of Arctic and a packenden insight as to how the future could develop. 
Not that scientists have all the answers. 
Neither atmospheres scientists still Ozeanografen can adequately explain the speed of change. 
But that is not from a lack of explanation testing.

Marines were among the 6, 000 in Arlington placed wreaths laid down 
The Obergefreite De "Angello Robinson went seven hours by bus to a single wreath at the grave of a soldier, whom he had never met. 
For him and the other marines, what the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they are entered. 
In a few months, from where we are returned, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers. 
If we were, I would hope that someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect. 
He was one of more than 6, 000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery. 
Morrill Worcester, holder of the Trauerkranzherstellers Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded in 1992 this tradition, as he and some others decided to several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington to dekorieren. 
It is now a 18 - year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, this trip each year, in various cities along the road to organize events, the people in the military and are paid to victims of terrorism. 
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (placed Wreaths Across America), the event has also extended to other states. 
This year, more than 16, 000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, at the Pentagon, on the graves of National cemetery Fayette Ville in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time more than 150, 000 dollars for purchase and transport of placed wreaths. 
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers. 
Although her husband is buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their way to give something back to the victims. 
She said that this is a small contribution, how we can support our soldiers. 
It is like the visit of a family tomb. 
Wrapped in warmer clothes the volunteers across the vast lawn land and hills of the cemetery. 
The volunteers were older graves from 1 and 2 World War and the Vietnam War as an objective, since these are not as often as the newer graves, the organisers. 
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held in the hand, while the fresh pine branches on the grey increasingly grave stones. 
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, the upper. 
The section 60, which is in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm. 
The United Service Organizations placed wreaths 1, 000 to this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars met this area. 
Some wept openly, others prayed and families and friends kept each other in the icy air. 
Some read aloud the names in stone, while others are too small black-white place cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet completed. 
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who was crying before the grave of her son bitter tears. 
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marineinfranterie-Corporal David Shane Spicer, to visit in July in the fight. 
No one should ever forget why we are free... That my son has paid for it, she said. 
"If I am no longer, I would like to see someone reminded of it." 
The U.S. government contractors by Cuban authorities arrested 
The Cuban government has a contractor to the U.S. government, mobile phones and Notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday. 
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, working for Development alternative, Inc. with headquarters in Bethesda. 
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. 
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December. 
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, on charges of "risk" can be arrested. 
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest. 
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime. 
Cuba has a growing blogger community, by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband persecuted and attacked by government representatives. 
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected. 
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island had sought. 
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by the New York Times reported. 
The new U.S. policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more space for opposition. 
Mobile phones and notebooks are legally in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees $15 per month. 
The Cuban government allows ordinary citizens only since this year the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for the sending of text messages, since a 15 - minütiges phone call would cost a daily wage. 
The Internet use is restricted on the island. 
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible. 
Cubans who want to connect, often the government must notify their names. 
Too many websites is restricted access. 
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare. 
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison, sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, press spokesman for the U.S. interests representation in Havana. 
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest. 
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong. 
An activity that in any other free society legally - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on freedom in Cuba, with the title "new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the sick older brother Fidel. 
Vivanco said that the defendants very often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned. 
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries move closer together for greater willingness to engage in dialogue. 
Pakistani government officials meet plan to send men to Afghanistan. 
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope this case could help to uncover a vast network of terrorist recruitment agencies, the Internet after radicalised young men. 
Investigators said that a shadowy insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks. 
Saifullah was after her arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps. 
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, which was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah was the Al Qaeda not convinced that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network. 
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist haven. 
They were seen as part of a covert operation. 
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who, because of the sensitivity of the matter, wanted to remain anonymous. 
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities. 
The case of five men - which remains in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruitment agencies in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy. 
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. secret service to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda. 
The Anwerber the organisation as Pförtner, those not let, whose commitment to the holy war not seriously enough and those that might be spies. 
American would-be recruits from a Qaeda a specific test, analysts said. 
Because of their potential access to U.S. objectives and its propaganda value, but also as hugely attractive to the group. 
Evan Kohlmann, of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years become much more cautious about whom they allow access, because the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods. 
If you try to get someone in these groups, what better way could go, as the recruitment model to follow, which so many have followed?, said Kohl man. 
The model is based much more on the Internet. 
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action" 
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the centre of the city kühneres action on climate change. 
Demonstrators said that 100, 000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25, 000. 
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city zündete. 
On a day when the promoted by the U.N. climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners through the city, which was in English, "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "the Earth says" enough ". 
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the native country of their mother, their awareness of what herzzerreißenden problems the country because of the already significant effects of climate change. 
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - on the floor pass and the world leader to appeal to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said. 
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way that the results. 
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either disguise or pocket knife. 
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations are banned. 
According to a viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators burned in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main canal, near where several ministries. 
They threw them in the vicinity of the buildings, he said and added that it began, but then followed by "a few large explosions" were followed. 
On the inside of the Congress Centre people on television screens to watch the whole afternoon the demonstration. 
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su as China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not. 
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive effect on the international considerations, he replied in English: "this is something that I was not even aware of." 
He then drove in Mandarin and said: "Because the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there." 
He noted that from the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would help or harm. 
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said. 
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people ". 
Test data show persistent racial divide 
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C. 
Although the District Washington still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, show the evidence that the Viert- and Achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made. 
But what in the latest figures from the National Assessment of educational Progress (National Assessment of educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and National level. 
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which increased its African-American peers but only three points from 209 to 212. 
In reality, The performance gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points. 
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he fell a statistically significant point of 245 to 244. 
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough. 
The picture over a six-year period is not encouraging. 
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202). 
And although the item number, the children of both groups have grown in that time, the difference with now 58 points. 
Some education advocates of the District last week expressed its concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children. 
This suggests that the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D. C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D. C. 
I springe not for a span of two or three points and Lower, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school. 
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the message is that the secondary schools the city need urgent attention. 
Of course, you would always see the positive signs, I respect. 
What frightens me, is that we are not nearly the time and energy that we need to use for our middle school. 
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils. 
In This autumn, for example, some teachers trained a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their young counterparts classmates. 
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth class games and real life experience to the fore, was under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum are some of the NAEP progress reported last week, which were attributed to that. 
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit below the central level, Rhee said. 
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue to improve the additional money and resources for the current weak schools can provide, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap. 
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results. 
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D. C. 
The objective could create political fallout working against this important agenda item. 
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class. 
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools. 
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education. 
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap is the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to extend, in order to compete with charter schools. 
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a greater increase in the next treaty. 
Higher education for more people than a future 
The coach reached the Gettysburg-College with a loud pipes. 
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is rising and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and smaragdgrünen lawn. 
Gracielas parents have completed the High School in El Salvador. 
Until recently, had also Graciela in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus. 
Their attitude and the other Achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, a reverence full visitor, rather than an enthusiastic future students. 
"Yes, I will be here soon!" Cried Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they are entering the building for natural sciences. 
"Wow, really?" she said food for thought, as the low teacher-to-student ratio of school reported. 
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children on their three-day tour visited and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's college. 
The question is where. 
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, what the High School or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands of what the college education is in the middle class. 
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the college - which is a remarkable achievement, given that many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, In the United States, to have concluded without the High School. 
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward. 
Those who study powerful children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent propulsion to success. 
Many of them also have parents who give their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools. 
But advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to college, especially if these efforts over a longer period of time. 
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them Wegsuche through the system, then a single measure at any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, who hispanoamerikanische students. 
We have to think about it, for these children a supporting network of pre-school up through the High School. 
The federal program that Gracielas college tour, is an useful example. 
It is known as GEAR up - a hochschalten - and is more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems available to launch the start, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the high school. 
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program since 1999, more than 10 million pupils helped, of which more than 60% in college. 
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10 
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can get to rebuild its damaged infrastructure. 
The 10 with foreign oil companies contracts of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions. 
American companies have only shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves. 
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday. 
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn The short straw. 
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June. 
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American valued in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts. 
Iraq has finally after six years of war and opened its doors instead of U.S. companies give Asian and European leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service. 
There will be no further bids in Iraq. 
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, American oil companies have probably prevented, analysts said to be more in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves. 
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, have significantly lower labor costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders. 
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies have been able to conclude contracts with the ministry. 
Major U. S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years, with technical advice, are empty. 
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend. 
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home. 
We all know, said the spokesman for the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the road, one of the major world economy, as well as a technology power. 
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern and will meet its commitments to Iraq. 
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which then with the fee per barrel of oil were compared, the ministry was willing to pay the emission of each Felds to the current level. 
Top planners of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan 
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week, a top Al Qaeda have been killed, representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism reported on Friday. 
This would be, if it would confirm the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn. 
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities representatives of the region by a number of missiles should be killed on Tuesday her car near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan. 
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a Drohnentyp by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan. 
They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was taken, said a representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone. 
Local suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the site and quickly took everything, which completely destroyed by the "completely destroyed ". 
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led fight against terrorism led an unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead. 
Somali has been described as a leading military planners of Al Qaeda, described the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan. 
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wanted to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the U.S. air attacks on Pakistani soil. 
If his central role as a given, it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe. 
He took strategic instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and turned them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks. 
The second American authorities representative said that Somali quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and best compounds used to other extremist groups in the region. 
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second civic leaders, but this reduces the risk that He was for us and our allies.

Senior U.N. envoy in Kabul will resign 
The senior U.N. envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election, supported by the United Nations has been tarnished. 
Oath redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send 30, 000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. 
The U.N. envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, other NATO could prompt governments to withdraw its forces. 
We need to accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and will send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul. 
This commitment must be long term. 
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in the political transition. 
The troop increase on the military side must meet an increase on the civilian side, he said. 
Eide said that he does not resign his office, but only one in March 2008, his family to grant agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul. 
He said that he wanted the notification of UN 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pass now so that he had time for a replacement. 
What I have said is that it is better to seek a successor, Eide said. 
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival. 
Ban, in accordance with U.N. representatives with the search for a replacement. 
The U.N. officials say that the Swedish Italian stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the U.N. mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the U.N. peacekeeping operations, has taken into account. 
Oath position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud. 
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "the mission have undoubtedly damaged, because it is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election was ". 
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid of the American-led forces in Afghanistan. 
He also urged that the U.N. leadership allows his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly. 
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome U.N. recruitment rules have undermined its ability to introduce capable people. 
The U.N. rules are designed so that I since May, he said, only one person was able to stop. 
This is disastrous and must not continue. 
Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions 
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he has not in talks on its nuclear plans. 
Gates spoke during a 7 - day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development. 
"One of the things on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit." 
The Obama administration prefers a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians. 
He said that "a package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it with nuclear weapons in reality is less protected ", because" their people will suffer terribly "from the sanctions. 
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran with "credible" consequences if he must reckon with its nuclear programme to the demands of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won. 
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that the talks to curb its nuclear program would resume and a substantial part of its stores stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor would forgo. 
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations to win. 
Iran, but since that time the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether they should commit themselves to the United States. 
Iran the international community in relation to a number of proposals, which it had already agreed in early October, simply has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way, as they did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran were never, Gates said. 
President Obama has 31 Dez. set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue. 
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of certain members of the Security Council called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution ". 
Gates, who last Friday should return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities representatives in Irbil. 
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues. 
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays of U.S. plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August by 115 000 to 50, 000. 
Gates also sought, the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. Representative quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will your security, your well-being and your autonomy within an united Iraq. 
We will not leave you. " 
A change of direction in the ageing China 
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them lectures that "mother earth is too tired to talk to other children" and "a baby more means one more ". 
These lessons have you learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "under no circumstances ". 
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child. 
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with a 8 - month old son. 
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern who are affectionately called "little emperors ", has produced a population crisis in the country. 
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN 
Department of population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent. 
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger. 
Last year, 60 - year-old children and elderly almost 22 percent of reported residents Shang shark, while the birth rate of one child per couple. 
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning practice has said that couples get normal reproductive age babies, in order to help "to help the relationship of the ageing population and to alleviate the labour shortage in the future ". 
Shanghai will soon "as old - but not so rich - such as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said. 
A gradual easing 
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy would be the most controversial disposal, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today. 
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines - up on her triple annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination in the workplace. 
Chinese state representatives have attributed to this policy, that the critical financial pressure on the natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy have condemned. 
In rural areas have some officials pregnant women who already had a child, forced to abzutreiben. 
Many couples have had to carry out sex-selective abortions, which an unnatural high ratio of men to women. 
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their stance on the one-child policy weakened. 
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule - including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder - and 2007 has been the tone of many hard slogans. 
Qiao Xiao Chun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials recently even more radical changes, for example, to allow two children, couples in which one partner is Einzelkind. 
Shanghai in July for the first Chinese city that an aggressive campaign to promote more births has launched. 
Posters, the families belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how we can apply for approval. 
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to couples at home and information sheets under the doors. 
They also asked, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child. 
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials. 
Disappointing response 
Although officials from a rural town in the external areas of Shanghai said that a recovery in the requests from couples to recognize is that after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts reported against any change. 
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115 000, for example, still only four or five requests per month. 
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165.000 - slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008. 
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children. 
They want to give her first best, she said. 
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and this is legally allowed. 
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government. 
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible. 
People in the West to assess the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife seven months pregnant with her first child. 
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child. 
The problem is not simply a policy. 
The problem is money. 
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance. 
Wang, the personnel chief, said that they would like to just one child, because she was also an Einzelkind. "We were the focus of the family and used that each of us. 
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want to. " 
Chen Zijian, a 42 - year-old, a translation company, said it plain. 
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, is to be successful and we must be selfish. 
The age group of 20 to 39 - year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to see and they want a life not for themselves, he said. 
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents. 
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years. 
Then there is the question - "we must rebuild his home" - and the life planning - "If the child is 9 months old, we have a CV for the best nursery schools." 
Most of his friends are ready, this time, said Chen, but not twice. 
Our generation is the first, which has achieved a higher standard of living, he said. 
We do not want too many victims. 
UN group plan to reduce emissions 
By the U.N. climate conference - which until now by wild postures and mutual accusations - has set on Friday with the publication of a document, another priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future would have to the biggest burden. 
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide both the remaining obstacles, as also shown the way forward. 
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen. 
The text, which was created by a special U.N. working group, is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be short and long term, so that they can overcome the global warming. 
He also offers a range of options for the key questions, including how industry and major emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the political decision-makers. 
The process will be given a great deal of flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington. 
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six-page document, has drafted a 180 - page negotiating text, with the focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, as "the big picture ". 
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries were to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 percent would. 
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 percent. 
The European Community has the talks on Friday also given a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation. 
The Friday nonetheless expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week had intended. 
The U. S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected, the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations. 
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not even two years ago. 
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging countries stand up and take action, so Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders. 
Stern gave its opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister he Yafei, stating that the leading U.S. climate negotiator either to "lack of common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States, China would help to tackle global warming. 
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines. 
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps. 
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers, who bear the costs of the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions for their they. 
This is clearly a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America. 
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they continue to a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight, although the leading participants say that the talks in the best-case scenario will lead to a political agreement. 
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning, a 24 - page draft treaty. 
Artur Runge-Metzger, the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states, "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they now are united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India. 
The talks got a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved to reach an agreement. 
Senior representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and rest breaks through the corridors of Bella centres meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to chart claims during the next week. 
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13 people, daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows in which they are fun of the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft Treaty passed from hand to hand rather than by e-mail - is already a challenge. 
The intensity builds just: Almost all important ministers are here now and on Wednesday, 60 government leaders in Copenhagen. 
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International. 
The heavyweights. 
Britain's first 225 km/h speed train defined the Monday feeling new 
Monday morning at 5 pm 13 will penetrate a pipe penetrate the darkness to announce a zugabfahrt, a revolution in transport in Britain. 
The first high-speed commuter train in the country in his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent to London St Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes. 
To Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin-commuter services from London. 
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains ladies and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland will connect to London. 
The neglected province could become viable commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the exchange of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads. 
In theory, believe the three main parties in this vision. 
But the many billion British pounds, which for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in the British high-speed tracks still the brakes. 
High speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should submit a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December. 
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network. 
The new rail line, linking London with the West Midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial. 
The free site is the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch. 
HS2 will also have three options for a larger, northwards leading high-speed rail network. 
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring. 
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands. 
The route would share in or near Birmingham and an Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. 
A single line would lead to Scotland. 
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a railways insider. 
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes. 
The first part of the route would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over a hour to go. 
The draft would be offering the opportunity, with a speed of 400 km / h, increasing the British rail network the fastest in Europe. 
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people able to drive. 
Up to 18 trains per hour on the London Birmingham in operation. 
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed, on the 20, 000 passengers per hour could be. 
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to the high-speed network. 
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential. 
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections. 
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections. 
The trains, first of the high-speed lines on existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, thereby changing the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours. 
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be a beacon for the rail revolution. 
Taxpayers for mortgages for 75, 000 pounds-orangerie a conservative on 
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative member of the house of Commons, has asked the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an Orangerie in which he in his house in his constituency. 
The prison spokesman for the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron, because he complained that the House of Commons members' meager rations "must live, has increased its mortgage at 75, 000 pounds to a wooden-workshops to build his second home in Rutland. 
He was allowed to the taxpayer to pay the additional interest in, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month. 
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were also by Sir Thomas Legg not out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons members. Last night said Duncan that the "not even cleaner or more comprehensible ". 
Duncan, one of the richest Unterhausmitglieder, has a zweistöckiges house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton. 
In the nearby houses have a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros). 
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and Esszimmer, but the fees Office, a spending control centre of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needed more space. 
Last year, he has grown a winter garden, in the plans as "Orangerie ". 
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment ". 
Duncan was also during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges not called for increased money. 
The committee has him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules. 
In 2004, Duncan security for a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300, 000 euros) from his London house on his constituency house, which he transferred in 1991, a year before his election as Member of Parliament, had bought. 
This week published documents show that Duncan until March last year around 1, 400 pounds (1, 500 euros) per month as mortgage interest refund. 
In April, its claims to more than 1 800 pounds (2, 000 euros) per month. 
The interest rate of Duncans RBS-mortgage has not changed during this time, which suggests that the entire increase to finance the money of 75, 000 pounds (85, 000 euros). 
The normal stufenlose RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where he is still standing. 
The latest from the House of Commons published documents show that Duncan in this May continue to be entitled to 1.250 pounds (1, 400 euros) per month. 
Duncan lost his job in September as the opposition leader of the House of Commons, after an Undercover reporters filmed him, after the expenses scandal, he said that MPs "of meagre rations" would live. 
"Basically it means that if you are working for the state that you live on meager rations and must be treated as S * e." 
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and will be entitled to a tiny part. 
And I have the whole damn sum can claim, but I do not do it. " 
The Member of Parliament, millionaire from his former career as Ölgroßhändler, was the first time in May because of his spending attacked when it became clear that he thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive demand." 
An activist has dug in protest in Duncans lawn a hole in the form of a pound mark, after it became known that he over three years 4, 000 pounds (4, 500 euros).

I have with this doctor personally, who assured me that he considers this trip as entirely unproblematic, I am very surprised, because I already had two Bandscheibenoperationen behind me, he added. 
Shortly before he went in RTL announced that the singer apparently after the operation "without Drainage, without anything" to leave the hospital. 
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known. 
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, in which he practiced at this time. 
In 2007, he had the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, In a Hämatom after a brain to resorbieren. 
It is also a doctor with dubious reputation, has several times because of mishandled operations and not to forget about Steuerhinterzug and fraud, was convicted. 
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical, has him as "a man without scruples ", the" regular "before the chamber board and" anything but commendable. " 
After a few days of silence was Dr. Stéphane Delajoux on Friday on his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, a statement. 
This said that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations were "normal ". 
The operation "no bleeding and therefore requires no Drainage," he added. 
In any case, it seems that the tour of Sängers, whose health problems since letzem summer äufen called into question. 
It is quite clear that it is a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) a little too tight, said Mr Camus. 
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and calls for the party Nouveau Centre, not to use their Siegel 
The alliance of François Bayrou's party modem is monitored, on Friday on a takeover attempt by the label, once by Valéry Giscard d "Estaing party, the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and under threat of prosecution asked this stamp on any document. 
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of this political legacy to defend, after he left the hand. 
The defence minister, whose party partner the UMP is, incidentally, wanted this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC. 
On the strength of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), which received a claim On the property of the trademark UDF, because he was the first this brand 2004 in the "Institut National de la propriété industrial ". 
However, the office of François Bayrou's friends supervised parties alliance udf's silence and clearly gave to understand that they are not expropriate and set the minister and the Member under threat of prosecution a deadline, this was no longer to use and transfer the property rights of the brand. 
They have made in the last few days many statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu + +, wrote the parties alliance in a letter signed by 19 of 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party modem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance. 
It is, you have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material, as the starting side of your website. 
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the party in NC, "immediately the mention of the name UDF of sämtlichem material and (their) website." 
One of Mr Hervé de Charette, "the property rights of the brand of their legal entitlement to transfer." 
If you refuse, we will take action against you, in order to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned. 
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" since 1978 a fully-fledged political movement and remind you that Morin and his friends "the election" to this 2007 to start a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, the party "UMP ". 
The party Nouveau centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française). 
They continue to remind you that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year membership of the party modem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement, has passed. 
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name, for three years no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP. 
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent manner by the absence of deposit of Akronyms UDF to carry out this for themselves. 
You have to bear in mind that this recklessness on the best ways to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "it seems to us but in politics as in life, to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by a name that it has no legal rights." 
Affair Liliane beds Court: François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploitation of weakness 
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François Jean-Marie Banier, to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane beds Court, a weak moment of 80 - year-old has exploited in order to acquire a portion of their assets. 
The 62 - year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a criminal offence, with a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of EUR 375.000 is punished. 
This decision means that it will be a process in this case, the saga of one of the richest families of France is worthy of mother and daughter scrap and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire in the hand. 
Equally, however, ordered the 15 Criminal a medical examination of the 87 - year-old Liliane beds Court, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors. 
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the, during the investigation of the public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions. 
Friday appointed doctors before 10 March 2010 to submit a report in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times are Liliane Bettencourt found in a state of weakness. 
I think they will undergo these investigations. 
I will talk with her, said the lawyer of Mrs beds Court, Me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing. 
What the lawyer by Françoise beds Court-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court. 
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) this old lady has manipulated, which must be protected, he said. 
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane beds Court a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him, the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings. 
For its part, Liliane beds Court has always been refuted by the photographers, which she sees as a longtime friend. 
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs beds Court-Meyers initiated legal action, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle. 
The lawyer of Liliane beds court on three of his Klientin at their notary sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise beds Court-Meyers. 
According to her lawyer Liliane beds Court the following: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, until twice a day to Banier wrote. 
Françoise, I have since their marriage never more ". 
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother. 
Liliane beds Court "is full rechtsfähig, is not under protection and has no guardian. 
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney. 
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place. 
Manager-revolution or the end of the Strategic early education? 
If nothing will change in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain... 
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of companies vis-à-vis the consumer from the marketing revolution: it is for staff to join "values" determines the best, as it was earlier on the consumer-products of the technicians in work designed to impose. 
By customers in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place... Although separated the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again! 
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation. 
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees affected. 
These demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R Eund, even more importantly, to those of economic intelligence. 
In fact urges the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision "; by the staff, which the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradictory. 
That is why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would be the staff in denMittelpunkt the concerns of the company on an equal footing with the customers. 
The very-related benefits of internal polls 
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange his, has made this revolution in relation to the management practice? 
I fear that, unfortunately, not. 
- First, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation after many roundabout, finally, to do... What it has always done. 
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures. 
And finally, because most leaders a very simplified notion of human behavior. 
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic. 
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the U.S. "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching of research institutes and through the media. 
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible, the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, an aktuellein Le Figaro. Fr poll by Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world. 
The mobilisation factors identify and measure 
Instead, a for the smooth functioning of the modern companies necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior. 
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental minutes: for the wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it clearly appears as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects. 
Now take only the studies from the multifunctional analysis this conception of the motivation of staff. 
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set, Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals. 
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can predict the executives of the companies' control their "social performance" predict and anticipate and its human resource management back to the right place. 
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence. 
The speech by Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right a 
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended. 
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded this time, the speech by the President, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin. 
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs. 
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that Americans want to do it, but it is necessary. 
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says. 
Obama, the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush has inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has in Oslo on Thursday, to justify the use of force; a way his Entscheidungvon nine days to explain 30, 000 additional troops to send to Afghanistan. 
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent have in Oslo "very good work ". 
I found that the speech was really very good, frohlockte the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's acknowledged. 
In some parts of habeich this speech quite as historic, Ginrich said in the radio programme "the Takeaway" has been questioned. 
The former members by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left" to the members of the Nobel Committee noted that they "were not free and a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist ". 
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American" speech. 
In addition, that he is "how" he always does, "he had" as an American president, "as he pointed out that the Europeans," as in a security bubble, which they themselves have created for their protection, and not do, "Gerson. 
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, unfocused and inspirationslos." 
On the left of the president of the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces. 
Wrapped the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns. 
The press of the moderate left, however, remains praise on the side of the president. 
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker as him, who is known for his talent, as "Monumental ". 
The speech in Oslo "offers a running plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper enthusiastic. 
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary" at the same time. 
Drivers: Three marathon for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas 
After a three-week negotiating marathon came the unions of road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation, which until the end - on Friday evening to an agreement that the strike order and the threat of severe supply crunch puts an end to Christmas. 
The signature meeting on Friday evening "welcomed" the responsible for the transport minister Dominique Bussereau the agreement, on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations was launched. 
After a second night of negotiations parted the negotiating on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement at the end of the morning to sign quickly. 
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting. 
However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 am until the conclusion of the agreement and only about 18:00 pm the agreement was signed. 
The conflict, "the company very much harm" and "it was a fear that the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau would affect. 
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport). 
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros. 
"It is not very much, but once we start small," Patrice Clos (FO). 
The activists are now instructed not to block The supply centers. 
"it will probably always be some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added. 
The TLF-chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement ", although it was difficult to give these wage increases in The face of international competition ". 
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages. 
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) of "a historic agreement ". 
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said, "an acceptable compromise." 
The agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel by 3% and the upholding of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow it, in particular, the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of collective bargaining agreements. 
M. Bussereau recalled that "the for the employers to the tune of 100 million euro" the subject of an amendment to the bill of the government the corrected finances for 2009, which was in the night from Thursday to Friday was adopted by the National Assembly. 
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate. 
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and that they then applies in the event of an extension by the minister for the entire profession. 
This will be the case "in a very short period of time ", assured Bussereau. 
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process. 
The federation FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trading ", because the 100 million euro" were the sector to offset some of the carbon tax has already been promised. " 
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the bird-Esser in the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra. 
For the association Otre threatens the agreement "small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a great digging."

The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country known; a decision on the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.

"We oppose on principle against the closure of the parties. 
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz. 
"This decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island. 
"It is obviously a reaction from the PKK," he added. 
On Thursday, the PKK to an attack in which three days earlier, seven soldiers in the north of Turkey killed. It was one of the most brutal attacks of recent months. 
New Silicon Valley 
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible. 
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital Moscow in the Soviet Union, was a strictly bewachter location for secret defence research. 
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley ". 
Major research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here. 
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ). 
There were several mutual visits and now signed on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol on closer cooperation." 
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation for Frankfurt Planungsdezernent Edwin Black. 
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies in the science Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd travel. 
Scientific exchanges 
It is a continuous scientific exchanges. 
But it is also about economic relations. 
The FIZ firms will be on the growing Russian market. 
Conversely, want to acquire Russian science firms contracts in Germany. 
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies. 
These include the Moscow Institute for electron technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika. 
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for the defence research. 
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city ") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded. 
Stuttgart brake 
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough. 
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe ". 
Right. S21 is much more than the deeper of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in utter chaos construction sites. 
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's. 
Head stations with tracks, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, as a modern rail transport appeared, as it was a huge amount of time needed, locomotives from behind forward. 
Briefly, to go further - so 's. 
And that is why the head stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich. 
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, about half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - so the slogan of "the heart of Europe ". 
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality. 
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city almost unaffordable to implement the deeper place. 
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, since there are modern turning trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends. 
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21, beyond the ICE-building after Ulm is now being addressed. 
Regional and local politicians have it enforced. 
The train makes with, because the risks of the largest infrastructure einzelprojekts of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company. 
Is still reasonably justify the project. 
It creates new urban area, is the computer generated graphics of the planners - with a lot of green. 
For the transport system rail is S21 harmful. 
The transit station and the routes expansion are intended for passenger transport, which - typically 1980s - huge growth. 
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost carriers. 
Modern transport policy, but it must first be to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads. 
But the new route is not because of intense climbs for freight trains. 
Much more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects. 
Good six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried. 
This is the official number. 
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic. 
It is in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and Engstellen in the network. 
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Transport Ministry. 
One of the most important is the development of good 180 - kilometer route through the Rheintal. 
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion. 
Urgently needed, right here on the tube. 
But S21 will act as a brake. 
The rhine valley route is the real bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe. 
Government is considering verdict on the Airport. 
The provincial government has in the Wiesbadener land left open whether it against the judgment of the hessischen administrative Court (VGH) a night ban in review. 
The CDU / FDP coalition have asked experts to the more than 400 pages VGH judgment legally, said economy Minister, Dieter Posch (FDP). 
The VGH in Kassel on this day in writing that the country in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport the night ban new rules. 
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p. m., as the country's government, was not with the legal protection of the population against noise at night. 
The coalition until 4 January must decide whether it against the judgment in review. 
The opposition criticized the suspension and on the representatives of the government to abandon a revision to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig. 
SPD group chief Torsten Schäfer Gümbel CDU and FDP to come back to their prior to the election promises made to return to a night ban. Otherwise, this is a "breach ". 
It is hellishly difficult if you must keep his word, Green chief Tareq Al Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We hold word ". 
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel back, the provincial government, with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to their night flights. 
A precise legal examination need their time. 
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression." 
We need a legally certain Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP). 
So, as the opposition, are the statements of his group never ban on night flights. 
US banks pay back aid 
The troubled U.S. big banks Strip their government shackles. 
The Bank of America on Wednesday the aid from the Bank rescue fund TARP amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (well 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop. 
And also the Citigroup plans after a report by the U.S. channel CNBC to reimburse the state aid. 
The institutions that want to get rid of restrictions with the adoption of the money - about the reduction in the payment of Managerboni and having to pay high fees. 
The Bank of America had on convertible bonds well 19 billion dollars in fresh money investors worried. 
The rest of the money they took out of its own coffers, among other things, by sales well was filled. 
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis said on Wednesday evening to the American taxpayer: the injection was helped on a very difficult time. 
The money had at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of investment bank Merrill Lynch verhoben. 
The Citigroup wants to liberate themselves from their liabilities towards the state also money in capital markets. 
On Thursday, the U.S. bank could be around 20 billion dollars in increasing its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles. 
A Citigroup spokesman did not comment. 
In June had already Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid their aid. 
Quick election 
It was then everything faster than thought. 
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board the editor-in-chief Nicholas Brender had pushed out, the station can present a successor. 
Yesterday evening, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie. 
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studios in Berlin. 
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure. 
However, may also have played a role, the ZDF-Intendanten Markus Schächter not further damage, should this proposal to the board of directors do not get through. 
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members. 
The outcome of the vote was in print this edition. 
Two weeks ago was Schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas Brender to extend for a further five years, on the board failed. 
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders dismissal was a bitter defeat for Schächter, an erwartbare, however. 
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not want to confirm in office. 
Had organised resistance against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch. 
With the argument that under Brender had the news of the ZDF lost in ratings, he rejected another term of the highly-regarded Chefredakteurs. 
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated. 
Finally, even 35 Staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate, the chefs as unconstitutional. 
Nothing came of it. 
The person 
Peter Frey are scoring was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen. 
He studied politics, education and Romanistik. 
After that, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau. 
In 1983 Frey are scoring on ZDF, firstly on the "today ". 
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal officer's chief journalist; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "morning magazine "; by 2001, head of ZDF foreign policy; since then, head of the ZDF-Capital studios. 
The Greens announced after the dismissal Brenders on Wednesday by the industries leaf medium magazine for journalists of the year was elected to, a constitutional complaint. 
Koch's adversary in the board, the Rhineland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week, the countries should change so that staff proposals of the intendant not by a politically motivated majority can be blocked. 
An excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, however. 
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had the board with a bold move, recommended by the body immediately after the dismissal of. 
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence could elect him both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a supporters into office. 
In the party arithmetic Frey will, the left-wing liberals. 
The Study will entrümpelt 
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike drew the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday a: at a meeting of Ministers and university chancellors conference, both sides agreed to improve conditions in Bachelor and master. 
The students should be able to handle their studies. 
In detail, they agreed to reduce the testing burden: basically every modul only with a single test. 
Moreover, the workload of students reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level ". 
Politics and universities also want the recognition of audit services between the universities inside and outside Germany. 
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible. 
Different countries regulations should not be beyond. 
Less tests 
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture ministers and Uni vice-chancellors of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth. 
Now it was the first time with a specific content. 
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of audits in part: "each module includes usually with only one test," it says in a 30 - page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of courses in part. 
With the "significant reduction in the last of ", said the accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a" trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted. " 
In addition, the "Studierbarkeit" future "the decisive criterion" in the design. 
Modules as content are "strictly to examine" whether "unnecessary Einengungen of students in the choice of 
Events "would be avoided. 
The students had "entitled to maintain margins, the own initiative and promote ". 
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studies. 
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "- which means that it will take until 2015, until all the courses were reviewed. 
Responsible for federal far ten accreditation agencies, which are the by the countries. 
The Culture Minister had the countries in October "with vigour ", on the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not too stringent verification regime. 
In individual Länder, universities and technical colleges with the country's ministries have already agreed to take appropriate measures. 
The only country said in Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds. 
The money for the universities in particular Tutorenprogramme set up and studies advice and review and strengthen foreign offices. 
Country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros. 
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants an amendment of the higher education law to parliament. 
This is for the conclusion of a study model only one more test. 
The study design should be more flexible, and the recognition of performance certificates to other universities and access to the master. 
By the end of next year all courses of the country on their Studierbarkeit be reviewed. 
The government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the studies conditions in the country. 
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions. 
The Federal Bureau of Juso-university groups called for the design of future education policy should no longer "behind closed doors," the minister and university chancellors. 
After the latest educational strikes should now also the students as "have a say." 
The future graduates received support from the President of the university rectors' conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper. 
The trade union education and science (GEW) went the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal entitlement, every graduates with a Bachelor degree access to a secondary Masters Course. 
On the other hand, countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor tomorrow with the best possible conditions studies available, so GEW board member Andreas cellar. 
The countries need to hire more professors. 
At A freer access to master the culture minister, however. 
More than a footnote to Herta Müller 
In Germany and is nice almost no control... "is the first line of a Gedichts of Lyrikers Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language snatches the arrival experience of dissidents, who the freedom won, but at the same time has lost its language. 
The 1951 in romania's Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as Lektor in a children's book publishing, before he worked in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main. 
Söllner is with various literary prizes, in 1993, the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the Hessischen literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt. 
For considerable außerliterarisches stir last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, when the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files." 
Visibly confused and move Söllner read out a statement in which he before Romania German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as for the Romanian Securitate. 
Together with some of those present Söllner 1989 had received the German language prize. 
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971. 
I am, closed Söllner, "anyone who is against intimidation of the Securitate not enough." 
The lyricist Werner Söllner IM Walter. 
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of from Romania German authors, shaken by a case that the throes and the cowardice of a political system makes based on monitoring and spying. 
Werner Söllner is, so far as we can tell bisherigem knowledge, not just the perpetrators, but also victims. 
In his Securitate file IM Walter have played a role, said after the confession Söllners literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter. 
He had it in for him at the time sensitive points ", "Markel. 
It is a moral need to make this comment. 
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however. 
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time, having their own acts, 914 pages, read. 
The people concerned, we must presume, in some case may also have known what lay behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter. 
Unlike the now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi-files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague. 
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered. 
One of the Birthler agency National Council for processing the Securitate-files (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, the publication of the files, but since then has been rather slow. 
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of the files. 
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar dismissive about the Prize. 
They have a psychosis, finally did it only once interrogated. 
The infamy of power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression. 
Certainly include the case Söllner, as so often in connection with sneak guilt, inevitable questions. 
Why only now? Who was hurt? The measured response of the Zuhörenden on Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than apportioning blame and shame will be determined. 
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote. 
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League. 
It felt as if there is a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party at a sporting goods manufacturers Goodies had distributed, as the new VfB-coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of a hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class. 
The man with the distinctive Glatze was because of him chauffieren foreign city. 
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before luck was the 55 - year-old as little. 
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work is continuing. 
Or just right. 
In the words of the first three days earlier Schweizers pledged: "we have reached the eighth final ", in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 - success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania," but we must not be blinded by the success: It is a brutally tough fight against the descent. " 
The "much more important task" on Sunday. 
Then, in Mainz the royal class performance in the league. 
And the once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11). 
Lots to appoint 
The eighth final of The Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17 + 23/24 February / Rückspiele 9/10 + 16/17 March) on 18 December in Nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers. 
The joy on the fulminanten commencement of Babbel-successor remained. 
Not only the supposed saviours, of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and game. 
I am on the players and told them that they should go back to their strengths, and have urged them to be brave souls plumber Gross said that as simple-sounding recipe for success, in the Therapeut no effect but Babbel had. 
He has a certain magic, Babbel defender Jens Lehmann, "if in football, a new impetus, sometimes things happen that you do not have thought possible." 
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of violation break thanks to its dynamic equal to the best players on the place, the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man of action and discipline. 
That is what we need in the current situation. " 
Under Babbel had it obviously lacking. 
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt Board 
The VfB Stuttgart needs but especially constancy. 
As Gross, players and managers, the victory against a spare weakened and completely swamped defense of the Romanian guests completely overstated. 
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 evil awakening, Khedira. 
And sports bureau Horst Heldt reminded that a season goal has been achieved, the other is still far off. 
We are not yet on the mountain. 
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interviews before the start of gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh. 
There are decisions that other and not the Jens, Heldt the harsh criticism Lehmanns. 
The had accused the board of directors, and the change coaches to pressure pubertierender fans have decided. 
Also that his free day after games had been withdrawn, Lehmann took as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy. 
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure self-interest," keilte Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man. 
They will probably not friends for life, the two forty. 
After all, but they were with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste coach team teaching and vindictive strong idea would not have been possible. 
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag. 
In the World Cup Fight heavyweight 
Hitziges duel in Bern: repeatedly provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures. 
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy weight-title after version of the WBC. 
The verdict of The judges was unanimously. 
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains box-world champion in the heavyweight. 
The 38 - year-old champion after version of the Association of WBC defeated in the night of Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109). 
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008. 
Previously, the Ukrainians was twice world champion of associations WBO and WBC. 
Unfortunately, it has with the K. o., all expected to have not worked. 
Klitschko built his record of 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to be on the basis of breaches. 
Challenger Johnson in the first defeat in 24 fight. 
Around 17, 000 spectators in the Berne arena wanted to dictate the 2.02 metres wide Klitschko fight especially with his left hand. 
The 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, before the duel of the end of the Klitschko-era, but again the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial into the goal. 
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only on the rounds. 
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the world champion but only rarely. 
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo Hoff man in the year 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds. 
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some. 
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie "," not right ".

This year he defeated in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States. 
I have in this fight only a blow abbekommen and am physically very well in form, Klitschko had justified the rapid return to the ring. 
His dream remains, but the unification of all four major titles in the family. 
Brother Vladimir is world champion of associations WBO and IBF. 
The belt of the WBA but the Briton David Haye, after this in November the 2.13 meter Nikolai Walujew entthronen. 
Haye had cancelled earlier in the summer of one for September planned fight against Vitaly Klitschko cancelled. 
Supposedly, whose promotion society now the fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium. 
Kunduz case 
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green group chief Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar. 
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor. 
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the recent findings on air raid of Kunduz, the opposition defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception. 
The minister said the deadly bombing of two petrol burden-if trains in September "knowingly the falsehood," said Green group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD-news programme "Tagesschau ". 
It is called the landläufig: He lied. 
The order to kill was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). 
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said. 
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only a destruction of abducted vices, but also two Taliban leaders targeted to kill. 
In the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein requested U.S. air strikes, according to NATO report up to 142 people have been killed or injured. 
Green, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident. 
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the policy of the federal government - and whether Chancellery, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Renate Künast. 
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism. 
The chancellor did not on specific operations in the German army in Afghanistan, he said. 
On Saturday were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry of the background of the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert. 
According to the mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tank vice-attack. 
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and the minister sensitive details. 
The context of the two top officials said, however, that the Defence Ministry even pointed to several reports, including a two-way document of the befehlhabenden Colonel Klein and a field hunters report. 
Wichert is now in a letter for clarification of the facts, the Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper ". 
He has not yet received a reply, it says. 
The ministry said on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which will be formed next Wednesday. 
Dream worlds 
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear. 
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between imagination and reality. 
As long as it is happening in their sleep, all is well. 
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should Unbound the wildest ideas and imagination entities. 
Anyone who witnessed in the wake up, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicts, at least as Sonderling. 
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge. 
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality. 
Traumartig modified guard awareness conditions can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness. 
Although cause and effect may distinguish the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations but on similar processes. 
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various brain is disrupted. 
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic climate. 
The gravity has no power over him 
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times. 
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of misleading one with a dream conditions" for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a climate, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a ". 
It is autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comic. 
His body is developed along two dimensions and quietschbunt. 
The gravity has no power more about him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling. 
He senses a kick. 
Behind him saying vicious with blood red, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend. 
They hunt him, him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body. 
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio. 
He can no longer bear the votes to attack and insult him. 
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet it a noose and fortified them in a hole in the ceiling. 
He is rising on a loudspeaker and is tightening the noose around the neck. 
The. 
The noose resolves itself. 
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!" 
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years. 
It was triggered by LSD. 
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi-low, he takes medication to combat depression, mania, the schizophrenia. 
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years. 
In the psychosis I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says. 
The images are cruel reality 
About one percent of the population affected at least once in life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is the second most common illness after the depression. 
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are In a übererregten state, hallucinations, sizes, relationships or paranoia. 
The vote is particularly widespread hearing voices, or comment on dialogisieren. 
Also optical hallucinations are not rare. 
The question is not important to separate more trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is awash with impressions. 
As the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes. 
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt the clinic for General psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg. 
The Schizophrene finds itself in the middle of it, everything has a significance to him. 
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as the dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and it cannot be. 
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated. 
A reality is not possible, the images are cruel reality, excluded awakening. 
Once in life to have experienced a Halluzination 
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically." 
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the Verfremdung Erlebens will take place in real terms. 
Why is our brains antics, researchers still puzzle. 
Exceptional conditions can lead in every person that he loses the short term, says fox. 
But not everyone will develop a climate. 
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants. 
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage. 
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain at an early stage of development, will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained fox. 
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system is the first not manifestiere over many years. 
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the choice is there. 
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, because they are in the transmitter system. 
If our brain is overheating 
The crazy, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs, in order to get, says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich caste. 
Whether mirrors images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position. 
Caste collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen, last year, he has his results in the book "the unreal world in our head." 
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases. 
These include mental disorders, such as Border line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata. 
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people. 
Hallucinations, so castes, from memory content that would normally be withheld. 
They arise when, in which sensory processing, discouraged or too little; if our brain is overheating or even if stimulation lacking. 
Drugs can trigger this state just as brain damage or a psychosis. 
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, love grief or other mental exceptional situations. 
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in life to have experienced a hallucinations. 
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the school. 
A normal girl, really. 
If it Were not for the images and voices. 
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair it addresses. 
When he replies, at the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys. 
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it knows it. 
She is awake, She hears and sees these boys, just as the girls in the bank alongside to see. 
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments. 
A pleasant feeling is that they like the boys. 
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes. 
But she knows that this boy and the other images are not real, and then disappear again. 
At night, are the phenomena mostly frightening 
The images are Often also a burden. 
If you are sitting in the room, it can sometimes do not, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new classmates, while he explained for all other hearing-and visible on the table mathematical equations. 
At night, the phenomena mostly frightening. 
If they are in their dark room to sleep is far too little and too late, they can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures she sees, the Fratzen or the girl with the bleeding wounds of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes. 
Let me in peace to the characters. 
Parents and friends told them that would be crazy. 
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old. 
In the last year she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend. 
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped. 
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists castes, she knows that she is not crazy. 
Cow is also a work of art from despair 
If someone is socially isolated or under appeal withdrawal, he has, in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes. 
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment. 
Sarah K., an Einzelkind, had as a little girl fear of other children, often played alone. 
Their hallucinations began with 13, when they learned that the man they called dad, since they can think, is not their leiblicher father. 
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish mirrors images and reality. "Every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there. 
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. " 
Also night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations. 
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis. 
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in their mere empty words as unreal. 
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability. 
Border state between dream and Halluzination. 
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world, unfortunately mostly pathologisiert imaginary experience, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf. 
A psychosis is a heavy, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - madness is also a work of art from despair. 
Schmidt Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a particular form of traumartig modified guard awareness. 
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, the Erlebende for real and he cannot distinguish the. 
The oneiroide consciousness state in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis patients who experience in full awareness of a motor paralysis. 
If a person of self- and world loss is threatened by continued, total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality by their own imaginary world, decoupled from reality is, says Schmidt rapier hard. 
A kind of border state between dream and Halluzination. 
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, a world currency, but the real situation in the Imagination. 
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and meaning in An intolerable situation, the U.S. people own ability, not in a loss of consciousness. 
Everything is real, later in the memory 
Even the Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul. 
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant posted on travel, while his body to the intensive care unit for Bewegungslosigkeit. 
Claussen appears in a self-created world, other times and places: He is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guarding his health. 
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles manufacturing drugs from blood. 
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso. 
He is completely on the imagined happened, everything is real, later in the memory. 
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream. 
Dream is a different situation, he describes his experience. 
In contrast, I have the memories from mental travel even after years and in secondary details abundantly clear. 
More and more even than really Erlebtes. 
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other secular life experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt. 
Ultimately show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal copies of external reality in the guards. 
Any change in the condition, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality." 
An experience which may also be enriching. 
The snow fall can come 
Burda 
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years 
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda his company in the hands of his two children, he told the mirror.

My strategy was never. 
He had "never world power dreams ", so Burda. 
I am not as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it Springer was, and I do not want to the World League with 'Time ', these shops have become too great. 
The promises of FonPeek 
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which only his e-mails can read without a chance to be able to see certain annexes or to surf the Internet. 
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the magazine Time on one of the products of the year. 
On the Stra β e to see is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest. 
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone. 
After the success that the company has seen it has two new devices on the market: one, that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, in which it must pay a six times higher price. 
Fonpeek yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version. 
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise. 
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe. 
Those with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to all the data in order to be able to read his e-mails, once you cross the border, or if you are desperate for a café with WiFi (or a link with Fon). 
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time. 
It is true that some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the fine print. 
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored. 
Au β erhalb one's own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so. 
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi / WLAN) this kind of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers are slowly but surely rethink and start to consider different ways how they can use their data network. 
Kindle is another good example in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet. 
Without Vetrag and without snags. 
It is an internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month. 
And that is exactly what I do one day of FonPeek expect a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United States. 
And that is not because I want to buy it. 
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you. 
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer. 
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system. 
The fetish colour of Michelle 
Yellow is undoubtedly the favourite colour of the American First Lady. 
At the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. 
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a bright green yellow - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and it was something gro β förmig gesticktes or a neck chain. 
It even goes so far as that at first sight seemed that the first Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion. 
However, the two clothes but very much in the Stoffart, from which they are made. 
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and in Oslo one from gemusterten kid. 
The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben. 
Every time the hair was different: the hair on this occasion as hair wreath tough, with the previous, the hair. 
75% of working mothers have given their babies problems in the work 
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children. 
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for women study "fertility and career women in Spain." 
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity. 
The study makes clear that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform. 
Those of you who no other activity au β erhalb of the House, only part-time work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children. 
By contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children. 
"the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job their first child on average only 3.7 years after the draw, a figure that to 4.1 years for women with solid employment, which took longer to achieve this and their Zusammenziehen and the first child until much later. 
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the contraceptive preparedness, "explains the CSIC researcher, Margarita Delgado. 
The level of education is another factor, at the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account. 
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education. 
This difference was in the women the same age. 
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the education or higher education have, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 mother For the first time. 
There is still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women. 
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent employment and their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way around and only a permanent employment and marry later and then get their first child, Delgado says.

Au β er that this book is a köstlicher readers enjoy, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again. 
Here are a few sequences from the book. 
On Albert Camus: "Reading his sides I found out that the Mediterranean is no Sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous driving, just as I have always felt, without words: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God." 
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what it is in the blood, not in his mind, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the Messerklinge that almost killed him." 
On Graham Greene: "Our man was from this woman with a passion that lasted for 13 years, so in its ranks, in whose meat on the grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse united, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the basis of the." 
On James Joyce's "Ulysses" was in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit of world literature, you must climb on the north wall, on the wall, to the best mountaineers try. " 
On William Faulkner: "this was a comical Kauz. 
He said sometimes about himself that he would be the legacy of a Gutsbesitzers county and other times, he said that he was the son of a Black and a Krokodils. 
Both dreams of a certain Grö Β e. " 
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer, the insane cry from a bridge from those personality from Munich, so that his response until well into the night of the 20th century on his literary way out. This he made during a journey that he fled themselves and with a speech full of violence before the worms anflehte posterity. 
Dorothy Parker: "One day they kniete and bettete: My dear God, I would ask you to do everything in your power to ensure that I finally leaving, as a woman to write." 
On Joseph Conrad: "At his grave are these verses of Spencer engraved:" the sleep after the effort / after the storm of port, / the calm after the war, / after a clear life you find favor on death. " 
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she had always their depression. 
The husband took it with utter normality, when she told him that Eduard VII it between the Azaleen ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek. 
It is not one other case, where the man known as much patience and love in a Neurotikerin, whose literary talent was still much grö Β er than their craziness. " 
On Pío Baroja: "What made Martín-Santos because otherwise, than to try to instil in Joyce Baroja? 
What intended because Benet, if he Baroja not to the arms of Faulkner? 
What made Cela because, apart from the glory of that man to destroy themselves, so that he can put on this pedestal? " 
Cowardly aggression 
My 70 - year-old mother was last week by our city in the town of Fuenlabrada, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, we have taken from the animal sanctuary and just six kilos, and then out of the blue missed him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard. 
Our outrage cannot be in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which is, of course, was on the leash. 
The suffocation attack, a woman who was walking comfortable, they wanted to chastise these people as a result of the incident, they even feared for their own lives, because if a dog attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is. 
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in The afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday. 
The dog has geheult all day long. 
We have, of course, in a nahgelegenen police complaint, however, we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards. 
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident. 
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun at an animal that We love, society and friendship. 
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people. 
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms 
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today. 
This initiative will draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident can prevent. 
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the road safety, "far more than just the design and manufacture of products with every day always safer" and confirmed that they also help with other actions educational and informative nature contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer. 
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, under the slogan "to be or not to be" is, in a first phase posters to distribute 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the best possible spread. 
Michelin, stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company, and it is for precisely the reason that they are manufacturers of tyres for two rädige vehicles are obliged to see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products. 
The sale of small lorries is rising again something 
After almost two years of the car market for small trucks finally some light at the end of the dark tunnel. 
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, represent an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam figures presented. 
These good numbers, however, are currently only with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison in November 2008, which is a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year. 
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the Gesamtzulassungen this 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year. 
Since January, total 95.853 vehicles were sold in this number, but all vehicles from which the vans market is: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis. 
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the demand of the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing. 
It is to these restrictions, which are the result of the tap the credit institutions are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation. 
In this scenario, and unlike the passenger cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little help. 
This plan is intended not only for individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions, must not exceed 160 grams per mileage may want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves. 
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded that it is part of the state, including a special attention to these small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses). 
The car dealers association predicts for 2010 a similar year just as the last, for which it with a sales shortfall (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%. 
The support in Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty 
As the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is now happening with the ESP stability control ESP, must the aid systems on the brakes in emergencies a duty equipment in European cars. 
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles was a waiting period until the end of February 2011. 
The by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems because of their operation also help prevent many front-rear collisions. 
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers system, on the basis of the drivers on the brake pedal to exercise. 
However, this system is not that pressure until the end. 
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned study, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss no longer on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force. 
Up to 1 000 accidents 
The Bremshilfe against resorts with maximum force in the braking system and reduced the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the braking process. 
According to a study by the EU could each year to 1.100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to damage, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten. 
It would be even fewer accidents - It is estimated that every fourth accident involving personal injury could be prevented, as soon as the so-called intelligent seat-belt reminders popularity. 
Then there is the vehicle equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver warns, while at the same time, a slight pressure on the brakes. 
If the driver then responded, helps him the system, to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, If it would be necessary. 
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes, in the damage as low as possible. 
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January 
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel. 
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, namely that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance. 
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be put off until the beginning of 2010. 
Dementgegen GM that it will take in the next few days a decision on the sale of Saab. 
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car Bauer, so that a decision as soon as possible. 
GM is to stand with some potential new buyers in contact. 
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports cars, which the Russian group Converg backing, ever stronger. 
If it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to China's BAIC. 
The decision to close at the end of the year, if it is not sold by then, will also continue. 
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder 
For the development of its latest and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 kilogram. 
In order to create something they refrained from first on the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms; thanks to this model used aluminum doors as the GT3 disappear "another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; au β erdem one has the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that further 7 kilo; through the installation of sporting Bacquet-seats again 12 and with the slight 19 - customs saved five. 
Then we had also renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and the exchange of Türgriffe by Griffe from substance the lack of kilograms. 
Although he also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride with a vehicle with 6 - hand wheels, mainly on the smaller Landstra β en of California, on mountain routes, which were really very kurvig. 
During his driving can give him only the note perfectly. 
The reduction of its weight but has not meant that he is no longer so sure on the road. 
It is, the opposite is the case: since long, we have no longer such a small and easy model test, which is a but also a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed. 
It is a small athlete, his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders, to slow to recover and then back again everything from his engine to get out... 
He makes everything He says. The car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as precise. 
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon. 
An engine Sound for all tastes 
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and we can still raise with the "sport" -Option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which already was used for the first time. 
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutality, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration. 
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable. 
The asphalt on the Landstra β en on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was pretty damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps. 
The electronic assistants on the whole route had almost nothing to do; and that, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning. 
In summary, we can say that it is an ultra-easy car, a car, with which it has an indescribable Fahrspass, as it would otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster Ss. 
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO. 
Bag girl ' 
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco starlett Cocoon and a Gelegenheitsstarlett in the fashion look of "maison ', they presented their rude face with the same obduracy as their pockets of Chanel. 
Much more than "bad girl" or "it girl ", it is a" Bag girl ". 
The Baskonia paying themselves a victory in Israel 
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many oddball players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82 - 91 during his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and is in the first place in its group after the gro β artigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight three the best of his team was in the assessment (29). 
The team from Vitoria, the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they wait until the bitter end on their victory. 
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 valued at three times contributed significantly to their final victory. 
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Red, from the very beginning to the top of the table. 
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out from the Perimeter, it was already guess that they are on the pitch with good reheated Handgelenken. 
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18 - 20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible. 
The second quarter was little different, except that the team from Álava for an innenseitiges game of Barac, and for the game by Eliyahu, on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause was received, the home is to their advantage before the break (34 - 43). 
Teletovic began, as the best of his team with 13 points, including wennn "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not the best night of Brazilian. 
Nevertheless, the game despite the clear advantage in the recess still not decided and the Makkabäer wanted the Vitorianer once again that on their pitch not everyone wins, and thanks to the constant attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into play. 
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to that the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50 - 49). 
Even more disadvantages 
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get air and one of them was suddenly the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three almost successive triple and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the table again a reassuring distance of (54 - 67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57 - 67) could make. 
The Alavesen last quarter blo β gestellt and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) already announced that they would allow anyone to them the victory in the first drei β ig minutes honestly earned had to take away again. 
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, not the best of their team and tried to give their team by three points from the line (70 - 77) force. 
Nevertheless, and despite splitter because the place was not on the team of Ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis nor in the last minute aufholten (80 - 85), had the game already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.

The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and a lot of money. 
Thanks to their game in the first quarter were the Andalusians start to dream. An aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12 - 18 in the ninth minute. 
Olympiacos was by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a domestic game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the ads table in the 13th minute anzeigte 22 - 20 in their favour, the minute in which the result of an action almost to the between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified. 
The Greek team began at last to be warm and his superiority on both halves, while the departure of the Englishman Joel free country because of a violation and the three self-inflicted mistakes by Carlos Jiménez clear traces the Unicaja. 
Among their players in the field and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with its three times, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44 - 32. 
A race was impossible

Unicaja tried to on the many defaults and the departure of during the game injured Scots Robert Archibald. 
Despite the many disadvantages for Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three times by Cook and the use of Lewis back some hope to 66 - 57. 
Nevertheless, it was impossible, since the Olympiacos as soon as he attacked and his superiority with centimetres within the basket area showed, was not to slow down. 
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed 37 minute basket difference to rise to 81 - 62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to surrender the leadership anOlympiacos.

Brazil called Zelaya to leave a date 
The Brazilian government has the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa set a deadline. 
The office of President must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January, when his mandate expires officially 
Francisco Catunda, trade delegates of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed the TV Globo that "Mel" knows that the message before that date, in which he had found since 21 September asylum must have left. 
"he is aware that he must go on 27 January, when his mandate expires on that day and he needs to find a new shelter." 
The station also quoted the ex-president, his intention confirmed, the message before the deadline set to leave: "My position is, as soon as possible, to go with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone. 
After the elections on 29 November (where Porfirio Lobo emerged as the victor) assured Zelaya that he will stay until January in the Brazilian embassy. 
However, he tried this week to obtain refuge in Brazil. 
This, however, foundered on the refusal Zelayas, the status of an asylum seeker politician, the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose. 
Thank you! 
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future. 
The measure used to stabilize the markets, it was the debt with the direct purchase of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly free hand in interest rates, the move to zero, so that in this way the banks buy assets. 
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as finished, and without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction next week. 
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy to sustain the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums. 
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the para-normal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year. 
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt will rise again. 
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn to an increase in the differences of the eurozone countries in regard to Germany. 
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain. 
On the other hand, a some uncertainty is damaging to the defenders of moral risk to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy, an awareness of what had caused it to produce, since the devastating effects, which the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should actually a new day thanks to action should have. 
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren out to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously forecast. 
A government which conceals the public debt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction. 
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso. 
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non-compliance of its external payments saves and therefore an euro member country meet its obligations. 
It is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of au β ergewöhnlicchen Ma β nahmen with the to the stability of state money to maintain. 
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses to large sums, it would now lie within the expected. 
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses. 
However, the European differences and reduce the Spanish, dannn would be a special Spanish risk.
