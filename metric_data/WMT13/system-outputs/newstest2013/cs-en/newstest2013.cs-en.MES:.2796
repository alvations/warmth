The Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policy is a necessity of the fight against electoral fraud.
Brennan's Centre, however, such a scam known as the myth that the electoral fraud in the US is less frequent than the number of people who will die after lightning struck.
Republican lawyers for the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, part of the measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada have a responsibility for the organisation in the US federal elections individual states.
And in this spirit of most American governments since 2009, new laws that make it difficult to the process of elections, or write to the electoral list.
This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, it was only for 2011 presented 180 proposals of the restrictive electoral law in 41 states.
The new electoral law requires voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, supersede the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the elections and taking away the right to vote to citizens in a criminal record.
Before the elections in 2006, did not require the electorate půkazu identity card with a photograph of any U.S. state.
The first state, who led this requirement, it was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the law indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.
The Republican offices with the enlargement of the procedure as well as to other states.
Over the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states, with the aim of forcing voters to submit their identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that, in contrast to the Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as health insurance card.
In fact, half-11% of American citizens, i.e. the 21 million people aged to vote, no identity card with a photograph issued by a government authority of their state.
Furthermore, does not have an identity card, about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affects mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years old, therefore, does not have the required identity card with a photograph.
And that's not all.
The students, who are as voters known for their shift to Democratic candidates, are not in several States entitled to use his identity card with a photograph of his school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs, who elect more Republican candidates, the cards issued by the use of these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state in the election did not require proof of citizenship.
The first such a requirement introduced in Arizona.
From 2011 about a dozen states adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens.
The measures aim to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
Indeed, should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer Democratic Party.
Republican legislators in 2011, supported laws in eight states, which cancelled registration of voters on the day of the elections.
In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write.
Those restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register around 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after 2009 but caused the decline in registering new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in the other five states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 to Florida were African-American 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%.
It was the same for Hispanics.
They were only 11% of all voters, but the 24% of the citizens of voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of the total electorate, were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Against the approval of laws, which restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly Democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors veto blocked several bills.
With a view to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States.
Part of them have managed to limit the damage.
For example, the laws requiring the submission of identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.
The newly introduced rules, however, undeniably difficult in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics talking mainly about bias approved laws and is considered to be an obvious attempt to influence the outcome of the elections in 2012 in key states.
Brennan's Centre of 2011 report shows that the states where those laws have been approved, account for 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, part of the measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Complete examination or not?
PSA test was sometimes inaccurate results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies.
All this has increased the reluctance of the men who are no longer so reluctant to go at all.
Let's investigate or not?
We asked two experts on view.
In the studies carried out in the US has shown a high degree of contamination between the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, said different mortality rates among patients who have undergone tests, and those who didn't go to them.
The study also showed the 12letém detachment that those who don't have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.
The men are also vulnerable group with African origin.
The key is to take the right decision, as soon as the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive forms of cancer and such species, which are inert.
It is therefore necessary to explain the patient the hazard of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, do not treat prostate cancer, which is not in the long-term impact on the lives and focus in these cases, the more active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, for which she was diagnosed with cancer, not a cure, as their kind of cancer is not an aggressive and threatens to life.
Rather, they propose the implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater precision setting criteria that help in deciding which type of healing and which don't.
Therefore, I recommend testing.
It is important, but interviews with the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo tests or not.
In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created Movember movement tool, which allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite the advances in research seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease the adoption of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving, it could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.
"If they stop smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," underscores the Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for Canadian companies for cancer research.
By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancer causing heredity.
Some percentage also remains unexplained.
For the Canadian company for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
They are also risk factor for a few more.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman Andre Beaulieu shaking his head.
An encouraging indication: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, decreasing the risk of cancer deaths by half.
Mass
According to the SCC appeared and obesity are another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommended to reduce consumption of red meat.
When too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid the sausages, which is the same.
Smoked meat canning, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"May cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent days, various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer.
However, research has revealed a clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory.
Although one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies talk more about the increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer is not clearly shown.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.
"To submit to testing does not mean that you have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The notification of the likely discovery of the Higgs bosonu last summer the commotion.
There is a view that the bosons are involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
And this is the last particle whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physicists, however, so far there is no 100 percent certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
Doubts about the fact that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as is predicted the standard model.
The new data published this week during a physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm, however, there are no longer any data, so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, the Higgs boson, assume that this is because the risk of error appears to be small, and look at what's happening.
In this world is completely unambiguous law, according to which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard, otherwise you're gonna get hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" roughly speaking, creates some of their properties.
Particle physicists further divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently comply with Pauli principles.
And at the other end of the moving bosony, mean-spirited anarchists, who weighs nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they may well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratories: Mesony, here we go unnoticed, and "containment" particles, which are spreading a large natural forces and the Higgs boson, which is probably related in some way.
However, should be to say that these are not bosony so exotic pets, as it would have been possible to believe.
If you read this article, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual banality: Photon, or particle of light, "which is" a "electromagnetic force.
When the particles with an electrical charge to accelerate or to change its direction, "interrupted" by electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "distraction" electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this is nothing other than the photon - and thus one of bosonů, "holders of power."
A more stable field
Also, it is with the Higgs bosonem, with the difference that "disturb" should be another field, Higgsovo field that the boson appeared.
This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; the excitation is necessary to achieve a very high energy values, like the frozen surface of a pond, no longer moves a lot of a large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part of the accelerator CERN Hadron Collider as the accelerator in the lab - a big, friendly ties is a circle with a circumference 27 km! - in order to develop a power.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field suits us once again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and stuff.
Responding to the electromagnetic field because not all the particles and all the materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be by myself to keep on the fridge.
And the same applies to respond with the Higgs field all the particles: Those that do have some mass, while others (such as, for example, a photon, look at him) don't have it.
And Mrs. Smith asks, what all of these studies are, what they bring to us, ""?
From the point of view of science is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, more than a few physicists have literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and to close some of the loopholes in the model.
It should be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, does not provide any clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which account for about 80% of the cosmic mass (oops!).
So far, however, CERN installations such contradictions.
Response
The response of these research in everyday life, Mr. and Mrs. Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.
Behold: The early 1960s had laser pioneers in the Bell Labs no idea of the revolution, their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulse) in 1962, I've already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy in the lab."
Imagine that.
And, in addition, may be the result of all instruments that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at the optics.
The sensor, even though it Boyle initially planned, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, it does not mean that the activities around the LHC we necessarily have to change your life, but it means that, you never really know.
Palliative care - the best way to get out of life... | Le devoir
The Commission, through its for decent dying Quebek recently engaged in a delicate issues relating to the end of his life.
The debate should continue, and at the same time, the bill.
In this crucial area there is still a lot of work to do.
The magazine Le devoir tried to look at the issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years of his life, and now it's seven," he said without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: Extreme weakness makes it impossible to remove himself to go to the bathroom, or to eat alone.
Looking at the appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat.
It is a brave and even smiles, talking with strangers who stop, brings his medication, offer a bath.
The courage of a death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, the demeaning to me," she says.
A few hours later he found a team of doctors on his problem.
"In all his life and learn that the men standing in the urine," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the facility Victor-Gadbois.
Return to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the skills of the man's" whether to accept the return, says psychologist.
According to the number of people who are involved in palliative care, the crucial moments are taking place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who are stepping into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
The forecast is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage of the team of doctors and nurses caring for them, provide the so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years, is the worst fear to die of suffocation conscious. "
But the disease to their children.
"I've got good kids," he adds.
"I have no desire in my life," he says, and then says to her breathing apparatus.
Yet he still enjoys in the coming days on the last visit to the son of Italy.
The home of the Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers providing care for the body with the help of nutrition.
It looks like palliative care, which is, if you cannot do anything else.
That death was more comfortable.
In Québeku seems a bed palliative care to 11 700 people.
It's very little, if we realise that we all have to die.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the medics at home.
Whatever the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you can give him, for example, a sip of brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics are no longer required to keep an eye on the level of sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
Last night, carrying beer, Mr X, who later died in the night.
This morning, drinks beer his son in honor of the late father.
"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care services.
The home of the Victor-Gadbois coming days, one after the other, but not like each other.
In addition to the 93-year old man, who was from the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while toasting his honor, dying tragically 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children after he tried all the possibilities for it to survive.
"For half a year, there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martelová.
53% of the patients who come to the home Victor-Gadbois, coming up from their homes, 47% of hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering, as soon as it comes into the final phase of his life, whether it's at home, in a hospital or in a halfway house.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Company for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize in more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to the fact that many doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed in palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard LaPointe, in which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec health care system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to high-quality palliative care, before it will be possible to agree with the implementation of the euthanasia.
As he says, has recently experienced a patient who had spent 14 days on standby in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.
He fears that patients do not ask about the death on the grounds that they are not getting appropriate care.
And, at the same time, it is true that many oncologists care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative forecast.
The hope of survival Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, when she left intensive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce quit with the treatment, said she regrets that I'm fighting, tells us.
And he told me that it's over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martelová estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanking his treating physicians to fill their wishes, when their team palliative Javier eased the pain.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care in the Society for domestic palliative care area of Grand Montréal, patients hinders treatment of pain in the 8% of the cases.
At the very end of his life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until death, whatever fits and starts, or whether they are the sedative administered on a permanent basis.
Unable to pretend that this part of the suffering we perceive.
The patient, whom we don't get rid of pain, it will have more access to paliativním sedation.
The sick, which is not provided a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia" means, "I want you to get rid of me pain."
The implementation of this story to grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in health care.
Large-scale real estate scandal in Quebec
Officials, businessmen in the construction and public works lobbyists, political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell what they know about their amazing, "" system, in which the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia.
The "field" came in Quebec taxpayers dearly in particular between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system crumbled since we have taken serious measures," he says wryly Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It erupted in 2011, the scandal on the basis of rigorous investigation focused on the embezzlement of funds in connection with the contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, the Quebec Premier Jean Charest approved by the then-liberal after long delays.
"Duchesneauova" report confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque financing of parties and corruption of public officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "but the Ministry of Transport on procurement billion dollars," when some people keep in check his instincts to get them to share!
"The Commission Charbonneauova has already led to the resignation two mayors," he adds with the hope that she could "to uncover some of the people."
The permanent unit for fighting corruption, based in 2011
The permanent unit for fighting corruption, based in 2011 is also engaged in battle with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
The police "Marteauovy company" who, from 2009 to ensure that montrealský "cartel penězovodů" significantly reduced inflation contracts.
In recent weeks carried out a series of inspections and accused of fraud and corruption a number of local officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a municipality from the suburbs.
Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his post from the mayor of the municipality Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when it was published by the Commission explaining the mechanism, "" acquisition of public procurement system.
He gave during these years 3% of the value of the contracts, which gained Montréalu, associated with the Mafia, then transferring the money side of the Union Montréal, for which he ran the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was after the year 2000 generous on all sides, and gave more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) provincial parties, in particular, however, liberals, who were in power at the time.
He admitted to arranging illegal source of funds for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
Contracts with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal, "" corruption system worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former engineer, before the commission described in great detail: During the 10 years he received from construction companies, presents an invitation to trips, golf tournaments, the restaurants, the hockey games and pocket change in the value of a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with penězovody, in which nadsazoval price.
Other officials from the transport sector admitted that he had to pay fees for about 30% to 40% by invoices through false víceprací.
The mayor's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye from the fact that, without embarrassment squinting over the concomitant budget, which led to his Treasury dirty money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montréal into large-scale crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými Members, who issued a warning signal.
As mayor of the district Rivière-des-prairies to the east of the island since the year 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million promotérům right in the middle of the prosperous trade in real estate.
70% of the dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally opened, says that "pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants, to stop gangrene and načapalo culprits."
"The process is painful, but the positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it is to be set up in Montréalu its own investigative unit, and to ensure that these dubious practices could not return.
As a cleaning.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned, in particular the role of "members of the well-informed about this ruse," if these game-playing them!
It is estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and with the irony, he adds: "I have heard that it is only a weak brew of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it will not resolve the situation: "As long as the severely restrict election expenses, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control system of public procurement and funding of parties: "We can no longer fall; focusing boldly to the substance of things, we can build on more solid foundations and with greater control and compliance with the law."
If the story defamed image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends all those who deride him to look at his own backyard.
"PSG is FC Barcelona!"
In this season with PSG put an entirely new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into himself, or completely new dimension PSG.
They came to us the big players.
Every day, I'm getting beside them further.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day I allow these facts to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier.
In football, things are going very fast.
But don't lose my head.
From my beginnings in prep school in the INF Clairefontaine after transfer to Saint-Etienne, I was always pushed for each grade.
Using the competitive environment, which has introduced Carlo Ancelotti...
Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
We also know that every training is essential.
And it shows that a player like me, has more flavor to the game, and he wants to make the maximum power.
In addition, and gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti in connection with my position.
Claude Makelele, who played the hand's assistants, as it is in the same position as me.
And Ancelotti has the final word in the nick of time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all of technicians.
Today, it is not the first league equal and are among the best European coaches.
Has vast experience, and with the top teams won a lot of titles.
He worked with excellent players.
According to me to win more titles in Paris.
In January I graduated from the comforting conversation with him.
I was behind a series of injuries.
Trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.
How are you looking at the first part of the season, PSG?
In the first league Lyon took the position.
But staying in tow.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: Very easily, we moved in.
What is your club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a match for the quality of European teams.
First, we want to win its qualifying group before Porto, in order to be able to play in retaliation at home.
PSG may be in the short term a major European club?
The budget is already on it.
Paris to become a major European club, he must win titles and write the history.
Today, this is not yet.
PSG has the financial means to carry out this plan.
And it would be a big setback nezvítězit 1 in the league in the last season?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year, really want to win league title.
We have enough missed last season.
In May we were disappointed, because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We picked up 79 points.
Usually, it is true that with 79 points you clear the master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it will be this year.
Even though the title and the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think that we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what was invested here and what our players.
It's absolutely accept.
It is a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and still find something that we in the newspaper, so it's not very pleasant.
A man asks, what else can they want more from you guys.
It is not, of course, to win 4-0 on every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up the game-style.
You need to build a team.
We proved that we can play in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season, and they have invested large sums of money, too!
Due to invested sums you would expect that you have in front of the other 15 points ahead!
The insult the other clubs, and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in the last season, with a new PSG moved on to the next phase.
It shows how wonderful it is 1 League.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG in all relied on performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that it says that there is a "dependence on Zlatanovi."
This means that the Ibrahimovič is a very powerful, and that makes a lot of goals.
That's why he came here, and shows that the star is 1 league.
Everywhere, where he has demonstrated that he is a great player, a star in the world.
In our team we have respect for the man and player.
He also respects the people, which is around.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows the other side-by-side growth.
How did you experienced Euro 2012 with the French representation?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as well as I would have imagined.
But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.
Today, I've been doing in the entertainment to play good games.
And that's what I had hoped for from his team.
We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves, to our behavior has been exemplary.
How are you looking at the first month Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We're in a good place in the qualification.
The coach, the players around and will be able to get for the victory.
Such was the Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has reached its goal by the fact that we have qualified for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
It is a tie (1: 1) of 16 October in Spain with a solid baseline game?
This game for us added confidence.
We are all fighting for the team.
Before the shock in Spain I experienced such a game in his career.
Thanks to the Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks
All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on the central banks, and the cost of processing transactions identified among the beneficiaries.
Moreover, as it is in the context of these technologies often true, there is a clear political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro, etc.), so the secure transfer protocol BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between two pairs partners.
Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.
About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
The course bitcoinu first reached the maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, he dropped to 2 dollars, today is on the edge of about $10 (overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products it is not impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on the virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro," and "equal to the current money."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by the fact that it is a "credits" to be used for the procedure in the video game, which gets a game or that he could buy (and sometimes back to replace).
The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.
Every month but the central authority of the controls and processes the communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes network depositary of current accounts, supervisors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How the network works?
Each transaction between two users is, in fact, between the two electronic addresses through e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key lies in the minutes of this new transactions in this book.
Using a mathematical task of the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is the stage of the cutting of the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital print.
The computer "assume" the new transaction and added to the number, then the whole "cut."
The aim is to find a number, which gives the impression a lot of zeros (at the start).
As soon as you will find this number, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructible displays linked to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have to change.
If the user would have wanted for the purpose of fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
The computer, which will solve the challenge, to win 50 bitcoinů.
To avoid inflation, divided the two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is limited by the number of 21 million, can be split, however, to the part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of the task is also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The Web site, which provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked, and there has been an estrangement between imposed bitcoinů.
"Used crack does not concern itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, the company for the payment of real money, which uses a network Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering, thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem goes for cash.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like blogging platform WordPress, is adopted.
ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book current accounts, and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů revolving.
In November, "were launched a huge discounts."
"Thirty thousand dollars," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul dealing with the transformation bitcoinů to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the book on the money, he has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but used for verification system Bitcoin transactions, which are cheaper because of it.
In addition, the winner of the manages its identity and so can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set for traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to address, which can be a telephone "photograph it and recognize," upřesňuje Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to in a more horizontal systems.
"Before the Bitcoin wins, it's going to take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," predicts.
In its report, the ECB also foresees a reassessment of the various risks, which are now considered to be increased if this kind of money will be successful.
We went from Afghanistan.
And what else?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in the Kapisa and Surobi (Afghanistan).
NATO and American forces should be followed by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan Army took control of its territory and that the Afghans have chosen their own future and wait for everything from us.
The biggest injury suffered by people in the Afghan countryside, which we punished, as we consider them terrorists.
And we, too, but we lost 88 of the slain soldiers, and what about all those injuries and mutilation.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often the peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies, as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even when he joined the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekové, Tajiks.
Now experiencing tolerance and frequent help local insurgents, but if the Western forces withdraw their support for the fall.
Withdrawal of French troops from Nijrab foundations, which I watched from the tops of the mountains mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, orderly.
The convoy of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul with no escort helicopters for aerial attack.
By the end of 2014 talibánci already in Kabul will not be so active.
From their unstoppable process between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
The acquisition of control over the country was regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans had paid the price for the obscurantism of peasants, which completely dominated Organization of Al-K 'id, their situation is, however, in our time has not improved.
The former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and the current talibánci coincide in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries from the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They were hustlers, grabbed state land, which sold as building sites for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used the huge American contracts for subcontractors.
In addition, discredit; most of them had never been in a fight.
According to what I've heard in campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will not be thieves.
Many young wants to go, just as those who could take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is significant.
Young has already tired of the war and the associated ideology.
In exile in Iran or Pakistan recognized the modern world and its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul is currently 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities are full of public school, girls as well as boys.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they are no longer want to return to the obscurantism earlier parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones; and the Turkish TV series, which shows the modern world, watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities, which are built into her forehead, considered to be legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army already renewing provincial militia, which will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation along the lines of the Western states, but the US wanted to transform her into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so that the position of the prime minister, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai wants foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
The country, however, is from the 1950s and earlier years heavily dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has failed to restore, no dam doesn't work, there is no major irrigation system.
Everything is imported; nothing to produce, fruit and vegetables.
Private initiative takes precedence.
In a country destroyed three decades of war would have been necessary government control infrastructure.
Rumors flew that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that's just the feeling that Western nations, there were only to be seized.
Without power for the processing of copper or iron ore on the spot and without any means of transport of raw materials across the mountains but no minerals can be carried out.
The Chinese Mes Aynak copper almost left the mine and left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area in order to maintain the role of major employer in the whole province.
One day, he will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on a large part of imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The exit of the French combat units has been completed 20 November.
The new treaty on cooperation assumes the continuation of normal types of assistance: Girls' and boys' lyce French departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the promotion of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, worked the initiative "to get his heart and soul" of the difficult task of trying to bring aid and military activities, in which the service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but thanks to the small French non-governmental organisation a number of successes in areas of common interest and steps for agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
The work, in which the number of local workers, has helped to dampen the insurgency: Irrigation wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, protection of the soil and the expansion of arable land.
What kind of memory to leave after two billion military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the local, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2 000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for a small agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
These farmers to be liberated from the uprising led by foreign groups, according to their wish to achieve a civil assistance in their favor, which would have been properly controlled and touching them directly.
Difficult to work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohammad Mursí went to another poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history the most divided because of the publication of the Constitution, which grants him temporarily unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.
He announced on Wednesday, regardless of the opinion of all the others, that the constituent assembly approved the final text.
Less than a week ago by the head of state to this Assembly for another two months to complete the work.
For almost two years Egypt used makeshift text, which was supplemented by a number of times, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to the legal argument.
This new initiative only further strengthen the ambivalence of the country.
The opposition from the point of view of the president remains in his "autocratic" delirium, "it violates my word," and "tramples on the right."
His followers have been assured, however, that it is a means to deal with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transitional process.
For two weeks should be a referendum.
It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the Egyptians to clarify the text article by article.
For the president it is also a way of achieving national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country being rocked by protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.
In particular, therefore, that this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people with an ultimatum: "Either approve my text, or I'll unlimited powers," which would otherwise have come to an end after the approval of a new constitution.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of a constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists text approved.
Most of the Liberals in the vote was missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, bouchli door with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.
Defenders of human rights, of civil society or members of religious minorities their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 people from among the replacements.
Some of them are very close Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators have also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes the day centered around the clock for prayer, when some members of the committee were of the opinion that the clock in the conference room is not properly adjusted.
The text on which the vote yesterday evening, is composed of 234 articles.
The object of the limelight, Article 2, remains the same as with the version of the constitution of 1971 and provides that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term "the principle of" the term "rules," which would allow stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been repaired, is a sign of good will and respect for other parts of the Egyptian society.
"The hypocrisy," argued the liberals, who see it as a problem.
According to them the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
Focus in particular Article 220, which confers on the University of al-Azhar advisory role, especially on the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disturbing, because "persons called to express are chosen, and they have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. "
Liberals fear even more by the fact that the next president should be less moderate than the existing ones.
"For the time being, there was no specific religious consequence.
With this Constitution remains Egypt by the state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university workers, many of them trained in French schools, "easing fears Alexis Blouet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, agrees with the fact that "there may be differences over the interpretation of Article 220, because it used terms belongs to a religious vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, but doable].
And in the future, the question may occur, to what extent they are civilian judges have to be able to express. "
In addition to the religious site yesterday approved the text is very criticized because of the expanded powers, which grants President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction of the former regime.
Another contentious point: The powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army will be verification of the defence budget to parliament, but the National Defense Council.
In addition, he will be banned in the military court proceedings with civilians, as requested by an association for the protection of human rights.
These associations in connection with the text, which is directed against freedom of its misgivings.
The offence blasphemy is maintained, and continues to be an insult to the disabled, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially for printing.
In addition, no article is not protection of women, highlights the Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.
It is the only positive point of the prohibition on torture, as referred to in Article 36.
The word was not mentioned in the Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was last night to appear in a televised speech, are scheduled for the afternoon rally.
Supporters of the heads of state will manifest itself on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" in Moscow: Emigrants to save money on language
While the MPs and human rights defenders still debating the law on compulsory language tests, the country has already discovered fraudsters who sell "counterfeit" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities each year, 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families back home.
The law came into force on 1 December, according to which each migrant workers will be required to pass a test of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
The FMS promises, however, that the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
The test, however, will be composed not only of the language skills, but also from the Russian history and of the foundations of the law.
Knowledge of the language will also be asserted to obtain and extension of the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where the Russian the official language.
This law does not apply to people who have successfully managed to reach an exam and get an academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits, the conviction and the protection of the rights of the
The network test sites will work under the auspices of The Institute of the Russian language, of the University of friendship between peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants may consist of the test in all the cities; now it is open in Russia more than 160 such centers.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing support as well as members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, the defenders of human rights often put a question: In the press and what it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?
In the first place - are representatives of migration services - will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the "slave labor."
Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Chairman of the Board of Directors FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
The only organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise in emigrants without a job, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - he says with conviction Sebelev - is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with conceding people who help him under the pretext of ensuring "voucher" into the cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, languish for months without food and documents and work for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receive many complaints.
"They promise one thing in their homeland, but after the arrival of the lover, confiscate their passports, paid the promised wages," confirms the Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't scold!
The less that many citizens of Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only don't know the language of the country to which they want to go, but they don't have the experience or even with the work.
Of course, it's not their fault, but rather an accident: Only a very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that there is a need to be decent to wear, shoes and equipment to the school.
As children grow up in the productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.
"Do you feel humiliated and degraded."
It is true that, with regard to the law on the language tests indicate defenders of human rights on one important thing.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If you do not have him, so they won't test, nor any other official work.
In the meantime, he lives most of the migrant workers, as well as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No admission for unauthorised entry prohibited"
Many of the workers' claims that the gain official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization of costs money: From 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
But the false registration can be obtained quickly, and only one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that we are, in fact, false documents, without authorization, and there are cases of blackmail.
"Require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - he had shared with reporters about his experience citizen Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
In the first day of the validity of the law on the tongue, it was found that not only are fake registration papers of migrants.
The staff FMS already confiscated several false certificates of completion of language tests.
Falsified documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not free: Each of the migrants in the hope that they will make it easier for the problem with the tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.
It is two and a half times higher than the official test: It will be migrant workers, three thousand roubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to safeguard the system against corruption, so that workers could simply buy documents, in that match, government officials as well as defenders of human rights.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise that foreign workers who handle tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed the course the foundations of the Russian language.
For the visitors, who can't speak Russian, work in the areas in which does not require an active negotiations with the people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take into circulation illegal market for guns
The proportion of crimes with the use of legally held weapons is very low
Russia's MVD presenting a proposal for a tightening of the law in relation to the civilian gun owners.
It's a government reaction to recent events: Stimulus were cases of shootings at weddings, which are dispensed with the victims of the massacre, and ready to Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradovem, whose seven people died as a result.
The police wanted to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places, and to increase the age at which you can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years old.
The head of the committee supports this idea Duma for security and the fight against corruption Irina Jarovaja, who promised that the amendments to the Law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of "tightening of the screws."
In an open letter, whose authors - representatives of various social organisations - demanding rejection "of the tightening of the law."
The percentage of registered weapons hooliganism is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist in an interview with the Russian editorial offices of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, for the six months of the year 2012 committed crimes from the use of firearms registered authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while in the same period, there were a total of 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of an open letter are convinced tightening legislation in the area of civil weapons fail to get the perpetrator, that went to the black market, "he said."
According to their words can be found at present in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From the race after officers
"The black market in weapons is supplied by a few channels.
The main channels is five, says retired Colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years in the workplace of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot sites that receive orders weapons
The first of them, "the Army or the military path," it means the weapon, which had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"They stole weapons and Russian officers and Kavkazané themselves," says Baraněc.
The other type of "black" weapons are weapons stolen criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that these include theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the institutions involved in criminal proceedings.
"Illegal" mainly comes into sales from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses frequent outbursts.
"There is evidence that some of the fires were based on purpose - to cover the shortage," says the former soldier.
His contribution in the words of Barance weapons manufacturers.
"At the moment there are private armaments companies, which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of "the black market is smuggling."
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines comes from poor countries, such as, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is the production of weapons, sometimes there are produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which organised their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
The experts, what is the approximate share of the different sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market, "he said."
A report on this issue in 2011 Center analysis of the problems and the design of the public administration.
The specialists dismantled statements of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals aimed at weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers, comes from the military and the executive.
Half of all weapons on the black market "due to the officials, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.
According to the data, which are available to researchers, 17% of the weapons from armed conflicts, in 14% of the cases of the theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology."
The salesman-consultant to one of the shops with weapons, who asked that his name, is convinced that the weapons found in excavations black "archaeologists' long ago nobody is buying - are simply too old.
Often, he says, sellers rides for new shipments directly into the military warehouses.
Ensign candidate to buy the unit, for example, the TT pistol.
In his order, and he'll sell it over the fence.
"That will take her to the city and sell it for 900 euros for a piece of the two magazines," says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and that is why whenever they will burn the plan in the detection rate for offences, carry out the purchase of traders with illegal weapons," adds adviser.
"As in a luxury store"
The seller, the buyer typically found each other through their friends.
I visited Web sites and blogs, as long as the guy who offered me the opportunity to switch to "test" platform, where it will be the man who would have led me into a corner, "where we are going to act together.
The price I learned there
The rapporteur military Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need acquaintance, who knows the way out, telling the clerk - poradce.- like that I have known, but I fully trust him.
Dealers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell her daughter lost a tooth."
And now I'll get over a man, which I'm sure of that.
He is also the only adds to me, because he knows that I neudám him.
Beginners looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Viktor Baraněc trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when the working paper for publication on this topic.
Changed patterns, according to his words.
They gave him the album with photographs, where everything was, "what you thought."
"I felt like in the luxury market," says a soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, offer a pig in a poke - everything you can try.
I, a potential client, just buy - let's go into the woods with the seller, and build a target.
"Give me a chance to shoot, and when I became convinced that the gun shooting well, we are beginning to act," describes the procedure expert.
The magazine on the couch
You search on the Internet will bring on the Web site of the group on "Vkontaktu," where he offers to purchase weapons "for different purposes."
There is no need for any documents or personal meetings.
"You have a set amount of money," says the headline on the website "Buy a gun or a machine."
On these pages users leave their notification and ask questions.
And sales to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user, "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moskva" - briefly requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently spread the vast network of dummy Web sites and those who wish to buy military weapon may be acquiring a shovel.
The people are as hungry fish to the bait and then winning coal in Siberia.
The rapporteur military and senior military official Viktor Baraněc
I've heard about such schemes: Web sites are usually registered beyond the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will pay over the ATM.
"In response to the seller sends a photograph and description of the guidelines is a weapon hidden," says spokesman for non-governmental organisations "Right to the gun," Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that, after entering the order on the website, you can remain unarmed and put behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has recently spread the vast network of dummy Web sites and those who wish to buy military weapon may be acquiring a shovel.
"The people are as hungry fish to the bait and then winning coal in Siberia," confirmed.
Makarov pistol for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms pay according to the estimates of the amount of the usual experts from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova of non-governmental organisations "Right to" raise the Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month for up to one and a half months.
The weapon was dispatched from the stores for long-term storage depots through the middle.
According to the official statistical office declined compared with the January-October 2011 the number of such crimes in Russia a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of solved cases of theft and extortion weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US workers are on strike fastfoodů and supermarkets
Work on the premises, "McDonald's" goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, in America raised a wave of protests against low wages in the company's Wal-Mart hypermarkets and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" Taco Bell, "" Wendy's "and" Kentucky Fried Chicken. "
So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
All this share support the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries, which receive rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, the organizers of protests, the aim is to achieve the creation in them in their trade unions.
At present, it is this economic sector virtually untouched movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, millions of people and, in some cases, was accompanied by the brawls.
In this day of some workers, the company Wal-Mart, in which the world is working to 2.2 million people, left their workplaces and demonstrated, together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals commercial chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.
Wal-Mart sold throughout the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries after vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average by 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many workers with low wages in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work.
The availability and variety of goods made from the chain Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics, Wal-Mart can afford to sell their goods cheaply partly because few pay their employees.
They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic or manual scanners.
The demonstrators on the "black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies sharply increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Wal-Mart worker receives 9.5 dollars an hour, but it does not correspond to the height of the expenses, staff members say.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company 3.2 billion dollars a year.
It's an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If the company moves Wal-Mart, an increase in wages fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only about 46 cents more.
For the year as customers spend about $12, 39 more than today.
Defenders of Wal-Mart, point out that the protest was held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 o'clock in the evening Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this period, the company Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Overall, the Treasury made in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the Huffington Post, a left-oriented Web site that posts left a total of "less than five" Wal-Mart employees, and that the protest was "the next media sensation," which the unions.
"Vacant Treasury!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where the aim was not trading houses Wal-Mart (those in the progressive city is not very popular, and that is why there are almost), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurant.
McDonald's says that it sells billion servings of, and then you shall be paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York 7.25 dollars an hour.
Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and the average of their rank-and-file workers in New York City 8,90 dollars per hour.
In this expensive city no lower wages.
Well, I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.
Employment in the "McDonald's" can get away with almost a quarter of American teenagers, who are working behind the counter after school on a part-time basis, and live with their parents.
Only a few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for a long time.
At present, in an interview with the "McDonald's workers, who complain that they must live off the money, and some of them even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at McDonald's, "" Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash and cooks in the fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
Also demanded that fast-food were based in the sphere of trade unions.
U.S. laws prohibit the administration to prevent the establishment of trade unions and punish activists of the trade union movement and layoffs.
On the other side of the administration rarely makes it easier for life.
In the fast-food companies to establish trade unions, however, it is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff.
Opposition
On this day, he also held noisy protests in a number of other low-priced Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action was at noon in the Assembly, "McDonald's" near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, in particular the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's" says that sells billion servings of, and then you shall be paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work! "
The demonstrators also support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event happens to be the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is as yet unclear.
"In the meantime, the brain to deceive the average"
Among the fans of modern technology virtual reality is a popular topic of the enlarged reality; the last time it means to perceive the world through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference, Google has shown a working model of the news, and in November it was announced that the application for the patent also handed Microsoft.
In an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that, for the company's scientists are a thing of the past.
It is the prospect of tampering with virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, the creation of a virtual public space.
- Tell us, please, what is your research group?
- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time, we're trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor - it is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because it is a very interesting for all the possibility of using gestures.
- What is waiting for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the system of Kinect interaction on a physical level, very much interaction is still under way on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The flow of information to improve (the system accepts larger quantities of data), but in the meantime, particularly the flow of output.
We are trying to change it, we are working on a three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.
The computer world is to be admitted into our physical world, make it more realistic.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in far better form.
And in the first place - to hell with those silly hats virtual reality!
- What do you think about the vocal control?
It's a popular thing, but does not exaggerate?
Of course it cannot be regarded as a panacea - raises the question of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood of their activities and intentions.
In fact, all the types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, control of the device in public places, we had a project, in which we thought about gestures, but not the sweeping, only about such Tiffany, short.
Gestures nesnímala camera equipment, but bracelet, which would have watched the movements of the bone and muscle.
So far, it is great in theory, but it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
In general, however, that the future of the type of control, such as a gesture of + voice.
- A what?
- How, for example, ask me to give you this can of soda?
Can you tell it, and at the same time show.
I usually just talking.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.
- So you want to encourage users to adapt to what may or may not machine at the moment?
- It is not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can detect a human reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, which provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.
- If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands of modern cameras?
Today, it is not sufficient depth or something else?
- In the current generation - that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be a good idea to raise 8 megapixels at a speed of 1,000 f / s.
But it's not just the megapixels itself, but as the nuts and depth.
In the current view of the case are all current technology for us - it's trouble designers algorithms.
So we have to bear in mind not only the resolution of the axes X and Y, and Z, too.
So speed is also very important, and the number of frames per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for the gesture.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects human interaction with the machine.
For me, the work was very useful equivalent of such equipment, but I don't need much touching, but I need some frames per second.
- A increasing the number of cameras, it is not necessary?
- In the Kinect system are now used three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and receiver reflected signal.
And the third camera - that is, in fact, the current sensor zone.
It is used to determine the depth of the object.
A greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem.
Or worse, because it would increase the volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presented publicly his glasses.
You don't think in terms of day-to-day use of the technology of the enlarged reality with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walk and constantly keep smatphone raised hands is not very comfortable, but I don't think: The strongest option would be a "portable" form of the enlargement of reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the platform buiding switch from his glasses on the smartphone, the projection display and around.
Glasses - it's a very personal devices, that is their strength (private things you see you), and, at the same time, the widespread weakness - the reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects in conjunction with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that tampering with virtual holographic objects in the air is available only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which critics often point: There is no tactile response!
Her hands felt nothing!
What your group is preparing a response to this challenge?
- In their lectures often say that the enlarged reality - this is the seventh consecutive a breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think that sensation could become the eighth breakthrough.
In the meantime, using one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a kind of background for viewing.
Excellent!
But there are also technologies, which are really focused on adding the solidity of these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several indicators of the ultrasound beam in the defined point, where the finger, tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on his fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that he feels it, what seems to be that he should feel at the moment, when he sees something?
- It is a good idea, we haven't tried.
There is yet another challenge, which will fight for a long time - how to get a man who is physically located in a confined space, to believe that he was walking in an open, virtually infinite space - also working on the concept of cross-country trails (no, such as in clubs), a moving platform, and also big balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, so there is still work for many years.
That's what he was doing work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are out in the early stages.
Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "avant-garde" devoted to the citizens, who are in the lead, are avantgardou culture and the arts.
At the top of the list has already been significant figures art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often located in Europe, without the All-Russian Scientific reputation.
The new hero "Rosbaltu" is an amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man, who is dressed all in red, which you see here at the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, in the fashionable pubs and vernisážích.
The images Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds.
Cyril Miller is one of the most purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - it's obvious the man St. Petersburg avant-garde, the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
In addition, he is a city person, his appearance on the streets of a smile on his face citizens, all in the mood.
Recently picked up the organ and became a Saint Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role bohémským mellowed his whole life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you all over the city in the red, and not in the yellow or, for example, in the turquoise?
- Did I red color as designer and image.
In this world of red paint represents a compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
Though generally, that everything is just a little different from the gray, aggression and bad characteristics.
But my provocations are aimed at it, in order to bind the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative acts is first and foremost an invitation to debate.
- A when you understand that you have to be an artist?
- The exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky Prospekt Station, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists and new types of artists I couldn't understand.
I'm friends with artists of the new wave, post-gazoněvskými, who had brought us to the "puškinské 10," and the next wave.
It attracts me to the theatre, clothing, music, in all genres beyond words.
- A it coalesced in your art-clinic... - For me, it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where should be to collect all the best forces creativity.
In 1995, I took place on puškinské 10, and there before the reconstruction of a musical-art club, "Bohemian Club, home of the petěrburkské bohemia.
There are many: Nome, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought to the project "Ear Van Gogh."
Šnur and his friends sang songs under the plywood, dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, among them in the middle of the composer Igor the dowager's, who is now in vogue.
When the band began to play live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programmes-galivských times.
We gave them Trachtěnberga, started by his great career, basic education and training received from us.
Gallery, "D 137," club "Griboedov - it's aftermath Art Clinic.
This way they left our workers and patrons.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something else.
In 2000, was organised the survey was in the press, the special price was "People in our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed, I ended my peak.
In the new times under the old rules is the work of an uncomfortable, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity today are different things, you can be popular, but not too much cultural.
- Your works are characterised by a recognisable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which it is vividly captured timeliness and intensity.
I'll be at the exhibition "of the Russian Museum in klaunech."
Clowns are timeless categories.
I used to be a social, today it is painful and awful.
But in klaunech everything collapses, takes a tragedy.
I love, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system.
Today, people are under the clothes, focusing on the external drive, not on the inner man.
Or maybe he cannot be made his hand, and it is necessary to spit in his face.
And the trick will be deleted change.
- Recently we've seen in the role of urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who could it be, if not me?
- A commercial art can be beautiful?
- At present, should be the commercial use of the art of in-depth, tactful, sweet.
The collapse of the cultures.
Previously, people gathered in knots, La bohème loved one, free from other people.
Today, everything was broken on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not 100 bill, I liked it all.
Today, it is necessary to think about who likes you he'll.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of their 100 fans.
- A Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators!
- The fans, there were involved sexually social sphere.
And the cultural ground 300 people and 10 thousand of them, and the result is less management, money, everything is failing.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one is fooled and violates what is ingrained.
When I was young, I was painting such images, which in one collector hung on the wall, along with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images, which people usually ends.
Today, people often mistaken concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, the culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of the consumer, it is elsewhere.
I am a man of culture of the previous day, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is the lack of Petersburg?
- Dobrých experts on culture.
There is such a concept: Over the culture.
Not all of them, but it can deal with the culture.
In the days of ordinary Tsars, it wasn't in all the czars, perhaps too understand culture, but they understood that there is a need to promote real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
For us in St. Petersburg we've got people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in a corner, because they are needed big experts, who correctly appreciate these experts and state is on the right path.
Today's thriving vkusovština.
The same Erarta, but they differ by honestly say that not everything we modern art, there are artists who would have to look for other museums.
- What is your Petěrburk?
- Petěrburk - it's not Capital of Culture in Moscow, there is far more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our fallow art is doing poorly.
We need a cultural ground, but for us it is today writers more than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are a great many people who are curious, who liked to go to exhibitions, concerts.
For us it is a layer of weak.
We need to get the art has become a fad, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented for the grant funds St.Petěrburku
Born in the universe
The country is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with the killer asteroid.
The caravan of space ships with them on board shall be issued on the road, looking for a spare planet.
In order to save humanity, the question arises: How to keep his family in conditions of weightlessness, or on the planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets, which it is possible to learn, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute P.. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus temperature to 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live at high altitude or in orbit around Venus... in the universe.
Addressing the issue of reproduction in space scientists began with the flora.
Half a century ago were carried out experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit, is no different from their Earthly kin.
It was then carried out the insects in orbit - a very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, was sent into space quail's eggs, to check how the developing embryo in microgravity.
The output we are absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," says the lab director of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they can't find support, the birds are falling and somersault.
After 10 hours of newly hatched birds to complete the demise of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
The trouble was that simply died within four days.
"We left the birds twice, but then we rejected it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," comment on the failure of an experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarcha" animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
In "biosatelitu Bion," but will be only one sex.
He ran the experiment with rats, who were broadcast into space already pregnant.
In fact, there's nothing supernatural.
"It was just to biosatelitech, but once again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground with rats born offspring.
The closer to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, however, so far failed.
It's a difficult task.
The animals in the loss of the normal environment simply cannot carry out its sexual instincts.
The man, unlike the animals can in principle.
Homo sapiens is an abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments.
But the women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger but Tereshkova's.
The most precious thing that mankind has, is a woman's body.
Our Chaika flew off and nobody on Earth, he could not say whether the last flight into space.
Whether it can after a flight to bear a child.
"I have no answer to this question," says the veteran-space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the second son was born to a woman-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice, and who also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts after long years of birth and rising health descendants.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in the orbital flights," says the spaceman-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Russia's Valeri Polyakov Hero.
Yet humanity must inevitably find new ways in the areas of biotechnology, radiation protection and creating artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a compulsory stage of preparations for the flight.
Here in terms of zero gravity, the astronauts embrace habits necessary to work in an open space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
Even though the water is even comfortable for adults, but, in a way, in a strange environment for small children is a natural element.
The little ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is at an average of nine months in his mother's little water, and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, only two weeks ago.
"It's very little to it that a child something forgotten," says swimming instructor newborns Marina Aksenovová.
In short, if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness natural state, then for women is a natural, inevitable gravitational attraction.
In the weightlessness is very quickly to the wasting of abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, dropping the ability of the body to expel the fetus.
We can leave aside, if they work promoters muscle activity in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the body of the mother expelled the fetus.
"What next?" Asks Valeri Polyakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial gravity.
If the organism gravity, the right to form the skeleton and muscles.
Newborn baby in orbit, it is not possible to dress as an adult in a suit in which he could coach.
It will be deprived of what it needs for its development of unconditionally.
"If you go to the experiment, which allows birth of a child in a foreign environment, we'll bring a disabled person on Earth, which will be absolutely nepřizpůsobená our environment," predicts the Commission on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So that children born in the universe today is only a theoretical matter.
However, once the time comes when it becomes a reality, and when the issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become home to their offspring born in the universe.
The boss: Švarcsystému check failed due to the politicians
The Czech Republic has in connection with public procurement supervisors and high-quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing," Kala commenting on the current situation.
Similar conclusions also suggests joint control of the Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice provides access to the so-called "Petr Nečas švarcsystému."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that won't bother his controls - is banned or permitted?
"The law must be set up, and if something disables, nor Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations," says Kala.
At a meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German party, under which was compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was it?
It is a parallel control, which we took off about two years ago.
Put simply, the European legislation regulates how to address public contracts, followed by the various national legislations and then also the experience.
We put all this together, and even if the review is not yet completed, showed us a very interesting differences - generally speaking legislation is with us, "perhaps even stricter and more sophisticated," however, the practice is better in some of the parameters in Germany.
Therefore, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still farther and farther away more precise rules, but there is a need to give themselves the application of the law.
In fact, this project can help you to do, what's in it for you?
Just such a joint control could contribute to efforts to stop the precise laws, reduction and improvement of the limits, if it does not have a positive impact.
Economy means to obtain the appropriate thing for a reasonable (which does not always the lowest price), in order to avoid enrichment, and possibly criminal behaviour.
But the fact that we limit orders, that we don't necessarily to achieve.
It may be that the system into a "paper" that those who want to find holes in the system, so they will draw a lot easier than if the limit was higher.
You're talking about domestic problems with passing legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the system of control in Germany?
There is a similar to ours, or is it set up differently?
With regard to the authorities, as well as works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, it also has the College, just a little bit in a different way, but, in principle, both offices doing likewise.
The powers are similar to a certain extent, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal structure, so has the following the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - in the system differs from our own a little bit.
BRH can only control of the federal money, we posed by state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the county and municipal levels of federal control of the courts.
As for the legislation, so it's easier than ours?
In general, I would hate it without specific data comparing, in some respects, however, Germany is billed as a model, but I cannot say that it is all the better.
It is therefore necessary to the fact that they have better supervisors?
Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it has to be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, faced with a wide range of problems.
Otherwise it would not be any benefit for them to cooperate with our office, isn't it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what is your office meant for the amendment of the Act on public procurement, there are no longer any its impact?
In view of the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control.
Because we're ex-post controls, there is a need to count with some delays.
We are seeing so far only in the process of preparing future checks - we started our new tool "detection of risks inefficiencies," through which we run almost 14 thousand public procurement contracts, and we've analyzed it - there is, of course, those changes will show, because it changes the limits, the conditions of certain types of competition will be adjusted, and the like.
The approval of this law is more for the benefit of, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm.
The problem may be that she "tighten the rules" and will not be able to meet them.
Under the previous rules are controlled appraisers provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means violation of budgetary discipline.
It is therefore worth tighten the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system shall exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, and not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And how out of it, then?
Let us show the way.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister, said that the ODS won't bother to check the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what does it mean?
Švarcsystém is banned or permitted?
The law must be set up, and if something disables, nor Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations.
He can say: "We will change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we will do nothing.
In the law on public procurement are relatively strict rules on how what has to be done formally - which is right, in order to protect the public.
But on the other hand, it is tragic, as the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing.
The roads are icy, but mostly passable
At several places in the Czech Republic, icy roads and snow.
Most of the time, but the road passable, somewhere with caution.
Karlovarský kraj
V Karlovarském kraji this morning, roads were passable, but icy and snowy.
The temperature dropped between five to ten degrees below zero during the day, but it has a slightly warm.
The snow stopped in the region and in the lowlands lies only a layer.
The ridges of the Krušné Mountains, however, is about 30 inches of snow.
In places it was even lower visibility due to fog, stems from the control of the regional makin data.
R6 expressway and the first-class communications in the region are now passable without restrictions.
Caution is, of course, on-the-spot, for example, on some přemostěních, where it can be frosty and slippery surface.
They are also traveled all the way of the second and third-class, including mountain roads.
But in some sections of the remnants of the frozen and places ujetého snow.
Especially in the higher elevations increased attention should be paid to ride.
Pardubický and Královéhradecký kraj
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, there is a risk of ice in the higher elevations in the mountains may be on the roads travelled layer of snow on its website, Directorate of roads and motorways.
Road builders warn the driver before frost may form, especially in the higher elevations of the Pardubice Region.
Ice may be in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Usti nad Orlici, Shelf, Svitavy or Vysokého Mýta, and in particular on the roads second and third grades.
They are chemically treated road I / 43 and I / 34 in Svitavy.
In particular, the snow on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow is in the top positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic is now mostly clear to partly cloudy without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between three and plus or minus one degree Celsius, the wind is blowing.
Plzeňský kraj
The road v Plzeňském kraji are due this morning, but in places with caution, and it is necessary to adapt to the weather.
It's the morning chill, the temperature range between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the snow and the subsequent cooling some communication can be frozen.
Some drivers must reckon with the fog, visibility, but will gradually improve.
It is clear from the information dispatch regional makin.

Most of the first-class roads to the surface of the dry and vymrzlý.
In the southern and Tachov but may be patches of ice.
The second and third-class communications are wet and also in this case, the warnings on patches of ice.
Drivers should be careful to less-traveled roads in the area of Šumava.

Shimon Ornest: The concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that he has less than a month after the end of the world?
It's just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap doing more fun and say that we're the only band in the world, which is able to gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent him from the end of the world.
Moreover, in December to organize your absolutely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine him closer to the readers?
It is a national fund-raiser, which we are planning for the past two years.
We have decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20, from 21 hours 3 concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Some will end up at a time when Kiribati on the island in the Pacific, which is in a time zone for 12 hours before us, Maya calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, this was probably my idea, then we're all together with our designer John Augusta.
In addition, that we want to amass positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we are also, together with the public to think about the state of the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at www.e-tap.cz us people can also support.
The group The Tap Tap, together with other performers also sang a hymn to the end of the world, which is called "End of the World."
Today it is very popular on YouTube, will also be on the charity concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, so if we can do everything and the end of the world.
Sing it all the artists on all three concerts in parallel.
Anthem suddenly link in a unique live on Czech television.
The words to the song he wrote and the key role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomas Hanak, sings in her Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We are also working with other members of the Czech cultural scene, given that we have a lot of charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to engage intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.
What will the proceeds of the concert against the end of the world?
The equipment of an accessible training centre Studeo, sixth year we s občanským sdružením Tap in the Jedlička's constitution.
The students Jedličkova Institute regularly running out of teachers and give them in activities that are fun, and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the means to the teachers themselves, we're trying to enable them to it in this way.
In the framework of the construction of the Jedličkova institution in the future there is a separate building, in which we move with this project.
At each concert several musical groups and performers.
According to what you choose?
We have tried to draw up a program that addresses all the generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All the details you learn to www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombastic action" in the future?
In May for the first time, we're going to speak at the Prague Spring, so there certainly make an interesting programme is interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I'd like to integrate with the speech in Washington and in Chicago.
Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you have, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, the group, which consists of disabled people.
How they manage logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members in an electric cart, the trucks must travel in the luggage compartment, and, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.
However, so far it's always without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways to us have been well prepared, I wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without any problems.
Thanks to the výjezdům abroad can compare how the individual differences in bezbariérovosti, access to the public with disabilities, and the like.
With what you have not yet met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than for us, we have just witnessed in Russia, in the east, everything is still in its infancy.
Compared to Prague's Moscow a barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric cart in the center of the city.
There are obvious, such as that you would prefer to be wheelchair in the elevator.
Fortunately, there is civic associations, which seeks to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind.
But it is important to mention that the improvements and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London, in Madrid is quite common for people with severe learning self in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
But it's not so much that there would be a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in the social life, in that we have, on the other hand, with The Tap Tap slightly ahead!
The respect of the public or is one thing, but it was not until the moment when one of us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things will really change.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years back what you in 1998 to establish her?
I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who have an interest in anything.
And since I'm a musician, playing the saxophone, among other things, so I, together with my colleague founded extracurricular musical ring.
Well, and, over time, we say our anchorman Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).
But popularity came up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us when we began to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
Us that the work, which is seen as essentially would not exist.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, moreover, can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so forth.
Your goal was to go to The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to the fact that we can do something different.
Showbusiness's crowded things, where imitating one another.
In a way, it's logical, everything is taken care of the new, and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it's only natural.
But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with learning disabilities are not suffering from all the things that we have to regret it.
These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I say that if something can be for people with learning disabilities, so it's not just for them, but for the whole of society.
This success has helped, too, that you are the boss, how many people it?
If we want to do a good job, we need to be, in many cases, uncompromising and require some discipline.
But I think it is perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that it must spend a lot of time on the road two weeks to go to the test on the preparation and the concerts, so it's enthusiasm quickly leave.
But that's the way it works everywhere, in every group, which wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were at the beginning of 1998?
The only Láďa Angelovič.
We are open to a group of people come and go, you can't stop it.
Who has the will and the taste is always the door open
The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours

Poland and the cosmos.
In the last week, was adopted at a meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency Poland as a member of the European Space Agency, as the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a fully-fledged member of the ESA 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects of the agency.
However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Flights into space, the Polish enthusiasts since before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.
For example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which represented 6 December 1933 thoughts of his pioneering work Entry into space.
A young engineer (born in 1905) left audiences cold and, after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski said of his work.
Šternfeld in 1934 for Entry into space in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), later became a promoter of astronomy and space.
In the Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became the world's known promoter of aerospace and his contribution was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.
It was built in Poland in 1925 trolley rolling stock, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal are not known and are not known, nor the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for the start-up car, or to its application.
Information about the handcar are known only from dobového press.
From 1933 to rocket shells began to deal with the Polish artillery.
Research Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the writings of materials, it is clear that the research came to the stage prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of German troops research was interrupted.
In 1937, the proposal appeared in the specialist press photovoltaic the interceptors designed by engineer Rohoziński and work out in the following year Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use of the rocket technology gave Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), to coordinate all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years his work put an end to the war.
Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish company Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
It is the first mention of the company in the November edition of the year 1954 magazine issues, in which there are four more extensive articles devoted to the astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed the creation of a company, which will deal with the space.
At the time, was already running projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising field.
Since the beginning of the year, 1956, Poland Astronautics honoured company (PTA) snažia for entry into the International Astronautics Federation (1951), and in the autumn, the PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation Astronautics.
He held the post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA significantly contributed to the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch 10 October 1958.
The rocket with dostupem 1800 meters long about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, it was built by an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovské flight tests of two-stage rockets RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should be able to actual scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should have a ceiling to 14.5 km, and its task was the height of the wind.
However, in 1962, was a further development of the suspended.
Heir to the first rocket-type RM became the Meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a double, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.
There have been three types of (Meteor-1A, -lb and -1c), which varied in size space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor missile-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.07 ounces and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The maximum ceiling for all three types of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 v Leteckém Institute for the development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The missile Meteor-2 was starting weight of 380 kg, and she was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then they were built in the version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Still, it should be noted Poland's entry into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also in the framework of the programme Intercosmos involved in research space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem.
Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.
In the last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The resolution has caused to the public a lively discussion.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems, is in permanent conflict between them.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free movement of unrestrained, private equity, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Under the influence of the considerable differences prices work (wage), the price of tension.
Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer tries to imports of low-priced goods to compete in the competition, "he stiffs" price competitor with a view to tear down a larger share of the market, and thereby increase its own profits.
In a massive scale, it means for most of the entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in the countries where the prices are high in comparison with other economies.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising social expenditure of the state.
The whole situation is an absolute unwillingness to entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social society damages in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to be specific statistical data.
Reckless practices of private capital in individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce social level of their own populations with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments are private capital to its own people, regardless of social decline.
This is reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to make its own people accepted the price the dictates of private capital, especially in the areas of wages.
That's what's going on, on the one hand, economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, both by restricting the rights of employees in the field of employment law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are already a number of years, public ticket food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay to the breadline.
Such a scandal was published, even in the case of auxiliary staff of the federal parliament.
The austerity measures virtually all of the southern states of the EU certainly lead to the same situation, where people are under pressure from the catastrophic decline in social level forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to be preserved for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might someday private investment capital.
But here it is necessary to ask where it comes?
If it's going to be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or a Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media ad nauseam, argues that the state cannot participate in the capital on its own economy, that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state should not interfere in the management of the economy.
Then there is need to ask whether private equity does not affect, now governed by the policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.
There is a definite answer yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all Member States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where it is practically everything reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds awarded the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All the power of the people as a Western-style constitution, but from the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly get into a situation, as her Appiános describes in his book "The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia:" It was a long time ago in full decay and authorities took over the violence.
The bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any barriers and people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice... "" decent people so that they shall not apply to the office at all, so that was once as a result of this disruption was eight months without consuls.. "." It is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man.. "Appiános thought of Pompeia, but he had become Caesar, who changed to democracy in the self-rule.
The conclusion As in antiquity, the current company is based on reckless preference for their own benefit, regardless of the society's interest.
Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply for society.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadent elites, without any efforts to reform more profound.
The causality of fascist and communist regimes must therefore seek economic systems in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Under the current state of the demise of these systems can be in favour of the type of liberal democracy be regarded as a break with the expectations of the next round.
In particular, the disastrous is the fact that the current elite completely ignored in the future can be held casualties, humanitarian and social disaster, which we have witnessed already with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition, both at international and European level Interior of the Czech Republic, the government will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
This trend is therefore the system.
The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms, which will strengthen the capital of the state involvement in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government, and will weaken a monopoly position of private capital in the company in favor of the state.
Israel: The chaos.
"Nothing would come of violence and never" Sting in the song Fragile whose main line in the chorus, "let us not forget how we're fragile"
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild Amschela in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a lot of reaction.
One is standing behind Israel, they argue his right to self-defense, and the Palestinians into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue racism Israeli state, genocide perpetrated by the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel belongs to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who's in the periodic waves of killing the culprit and the victim, who, after all, the people of Israel today, including self-governing territory were born into the current political situation and the beginning of the violence.
It's to offer readers to look behind the curtain, the sight of it, who mainly serves 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily in the history of the struggle for power.
In every era can be traced some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personality, which completely autonomously governed by their actions and / or whether someone was standing behind the throne, who channeled their actions to advance vytýčenému objectives.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world is zkoncentrováno wealth in the hands of a few and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of one generation.
Among those astronomically rich families singled out one, which could be considered to head an octopus (if anyone still stands above them I don't know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschieldové.
Doesn't say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) has already bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop the merger of his name with a highly criminal deeds, stood in the background, and always meant a consolidation of power, wealth, or both.
They are the main shares in almost all central banks in the world and against countries, where shares in the Central Bank have or are preparing war (before the attack Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after invading Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime, Russia had been subordinated to the central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defy the family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank Rothschieldově Bank of America, began during the civil war to make his own (government) money, and he was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish FED, was murdered by 1963, a member of the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after what he wanted to sue FED for the start of the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power resulted in 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan three world wars a Freemason, the 33rd degree of Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of removing large monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial estates, in particular the United Kingdom, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere on the 0.5-1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury and do not consume enough resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and end the absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is the cause of the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (ab chao - order out of chaos.)
But these solutions are false and lead to a deterioration of the situation (see establishing FED, in order to avoid crises like the one that caused in 1907).
So after what they managed to murder of imperial heir to the throne R-U Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, destroyed the Czarist Russia run the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (no longer need to war for the destruction of Czarist Russia), and then there was the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austro.
To make it easier to start of the Second World War left bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation by Germany to impose huge war reparations, which created a presumption radicalisation's impoverished masses, and then they just slip the Germans sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering Leader and creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play, and also played a role in the fifth column, sparking a fire.
At the end of the 19th century prompted Rothschieldové establishing Zionist movement, whose one branch to seek the creation of the Jewish state, not preferentially in the historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital of the (return to Zion).
Already the Balfourova Declaration has created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, to the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, if Hitler pulled the chain, which it initially held international bankers, or what was in the plan is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp has created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany 2.světovou off to war, the state of Israel was created the third outbreak of war.
If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish nation, like the other victims in the front line of fighting now, together with the Arab or Muslim populations in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country, but also in the international arena (consider just how sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence, when it stood at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the people of Israel from their leaders, as much as for us, peddled international bankers for the people to choose their own candidates in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, international bankers loyal, a policy that it is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), threatened to escalate into a global conflict, and due to the control of Iran over moving through the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of all the world's oil shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), as well as to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what is now appears to be the words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis, and the people will agree with a new world order."
A new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
The world, where each of the newly born individuals implanted in the birth of the chip, which will make it the totally controlled entity.
"And it makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have the right hand or forehead brand, so that he could not buy or sell, who is not marked on behalf of the beast or number of its name.
It is important to understand: Who has the sense to combine the beast.
This number indicates a man, and that number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: When is the worst call Hollywood
In November 1979 Islamist students occupied the crowd demonstrating the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, which had been the patron saint of the regime for several decades.
The situation for the US administration offered a positive way - to throw the Shah overboard couldn't afford, since this would jeopardise the trust with allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later compounded the fiasco attempt to free the hostages by force.
Diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered Algerian Government.
Their plight has caused a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has contributed significantly to the defeat of the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The movie actor Ben Affleck's Argo režírujícího describes one episode of the history of America, which has brought a small victory.
Just before the embassy occupation have fled from her six employees.
After the complex business ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them out of Iran, helped the extravagant a cover story - went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country surveyed the location for the filming of sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, devised an expert on "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation Hollywood.
The legend was credible, said the film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, a production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a strange combination of more genres.
On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "right" movie, the story during a piece of foul play - for example, it may be a series of Danny's teammates.
In the film, the mood - on the one hand, the documentation or evidence on the broader sequence from Tehran (in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické photographs of events and the way in which they were the same situation presented in the film, the big differences aren't in it).
On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there was the scene of the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions -muži in suits dismantled the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone.
Ben Affleckovi remarkable way to restart a career.
From vysmívaného actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be a cynical comment.
ARGO is his third feature film, after the Czech writers Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck picture, which is not taking place in režisérově home Boston.
A feel for the atmosphere of the place, one of the characteristics that director older films place over the Hollywood standard.
He and Affleck, is also reflected in the Argos, where Tehran "plays Canada."
The best scene in the movie is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování real events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, who also conveys emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti, which occur when all of a sudden move history.
A similar effect of Affleck and his colleagues in the scenes contrived (false staff at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that told the story offers a lot of exciting scenes in the film.
Quite successfully, it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - it's all so elegantly doesn't (a scene in which the imminent crisis at the Tehran airport will call in America and chase down the runway is too far-fetched).
But it is a weakness in the Argo ramblings resulting from the need to show too much in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles of Hollywood collaborators was very charming, but their figures would have meant more space and not far from the only thing in the movie.
Affleck film loses a dramatic move, it's a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation of the retro style reminiscent of thrillers of the 1970s.
But it is hard.
As a reminder of one sort of living history as well as proof of how exaggerated notions of allpowerful and knowing secret services, but will suffice.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare the "absurd regulations or ideas from the workshop of the EU."
"Led us to the last event, where the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the management of large European companies," he told Právo organizer Patrick Nacher.
The nominees absurditami, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unification premium rates for men and women.
So far, the women in the prices of the life insurance beneficiary, because they are less risky for insurance companies objectively.
"Another unbelievable ideas from the EU can nominate people by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations are even mandatory blending biofuels into the fuel, which as a result of the harmful nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the size of a hen cages, for which this year, significantly more expensive eggs.
Also faced criticism before the de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or light bulbs from the sale.
High-quality bananas have 14 inches
The camera often are under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a state or group of states (and the Czech Republic now and the threat of veto promotes the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby, as well as for the fact that, for example, had the highest quality bananas in the European Union to achieve at least 14 cm in length, and allowed to report "anomalous twist."
The European Commission is hindered by the fact that only harmonises the uniform national standards, which was hampered by a trade.
Rules on fruit and vegetables, the EU despite the opposition of some of the States softened, pointing out that the existing Directive lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in the poll may be the last EU regulations, according to which must be sold balloons warning that children younger than 8 years is not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to the American research, according to which the balloons among the toys are the leading cause of death in children to suffocation.
Similar restrictions now pays for children up to 14 years in blowing into the carny frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born at home
It is quite absurd and then rule on the European officials themselves - everyone who has an official role in the EU, with regard to the sensitive topic for Greece to use the name Macedonia, and must instead to talk about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez nominated to the polls in addition to some of the above absurdities even EU regulations on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set a maximum volumes of food stocks, which could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then crossed for example set by the volumes of preserved mushrooms, for which he was fined.
Organizers took the idea to pay some countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies on a request to obtain subsidies.
These ideas, however, have not been incurred in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're handicapováni by the fact that we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for reimbursement, "he said in the autumn of 2004, Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument for us so many grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported.
The fact that the Czech Republic has continued to ports, according to the EU should Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally came out of the Czech Republic to meet, organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grant to obtain subsidies offered to municipalities, the Ministry for Local Development Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, should go to write applications for subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although the regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, the efficient functioning and development of the entire European Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition.
More serious problem is, according to the experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies for projects, which have no hint of something to do with the deepening of European integration, but which in budget negotiations with the Member States.
Emotions among Czechs, as well as other countries of the European Union in Brussels in the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific marking their traditional products, which do not always succeed in this fight.
The Czechs after a six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians Loštice with a factory producing, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our producers renamed tuzemák.
Naming the rum can carry a cane distillate products, and not from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of registered products in the company of the world-renowned feta cheese, Gorgonzola, gathered from the German Lübeck or Parma ham, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr Žatecký chmel.
Then the EU trademark can also boast Pardubice gingerbread and the tube.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how a person thinks that he wants to run for president?
It's not about that, to be a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, so nekandiduji anywhere.
But I can't see how the country for the last twenty years rozkrádá, as the thieves running, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be policies.
But when I see something that I don't like, so I'm trying to come up with a solution on how to change it.
And since I was 40, and I'm an independent nestraník, I don't have any other option, how things affect than to run for the Senate or the president.
You've got to the Senate, but then you went to the Castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
All the time, I said that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the outcome of the congressional elections.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I'll run for president.
But my aim is not a function, function is a tool, how can I carry out his vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not just that, as a nation at in the pub and in front of the TV, but that the trampling on anyone who wants to try to change.
Add to that the media, which man dehonestují and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For me, it was claimed that uplácím journalists, or that I was a consultant Jiřího Paroubka.
Let's go to your vision.
The fight for the Castle you started with the idea of the material and the criminal liability of politicians and re-admission over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
As president, but you don't have that power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you want to settle?
When I was a citizen průvodcovství lobbied for it to be free trade, managed to get it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, deliberately rejected, and that citizens staying.
As an independent nestraník have far greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that, without partisan categorization and dogmas, I can take something, what is best for our country, from each side, and to apply it.
Do you consider yourself more as a human right-wing or left-wing?
The Czech perspective, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
For me it is not important, if a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it is important for us to go forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want people to associate.
I am always any public good solution, even though it will propose of the Communist Party, or ODS, and so I'm going against a bad idea.
Čertíte, when someone tells you that you are populist.
But proves that what you said?
When you construct byznysplán within the company, as well as have an ideal target and vision.
And you're trying to get close to it.
Some may call it populism, but all of the proposals that I'm talking about, in the world of work, or talked about them prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament you're gonna be a password.
And with that, in the long-term policy nevystačíte.
Or do you think that when you're for people to walk and talk with them, that you can get, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and members of the public and try to get them on your side to push it.
If he was elected president, is not a problem to hold televised live, where I'm going to ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to say why they don't want it.
When will be strong personality, which will be to abuses, it can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was a credit to public pressure.
On the plane, I say that I was an amateur, that I'm not a genius, or an intellectual.
For his views and vision of trying to find allies.
I just started in politics, and I'll try to get majority support for his program.
I'm trying to push myself, if it doesn't work, for six years, and I'll go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little, as if he had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that in one person to do nothing, that's why I walked around a number of well-known people, whether it would also stand as candidates for the Senate.
I went to Radimem Jančurou, that because of the amount of work he refused.
So I supported at least an investigative journalist John Lorencovou rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oil.
I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who followed, most of the elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we just two independent.
People navolili Senate so that it will be difficult to promote change.
Still, I'm going to fight for your vision, such as, for example, for the direct election of mayors or generals.
You're thinking about establishing his own party?
I hadn't even thought about it, because I don't have time to check the net past each potential Party man, and I don't have the money to do it.
I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
Private property for about 60 million.
In Prague, I land about 25 million apartment in ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a couple of million in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin, therefore, that it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was a gallant to women and, at the same time, he fought against the wickedness and excesses.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, you have the assets for 60 million, and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give their own money into it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
It's got into debt?
I bumped into campaign had 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors, testifies to the fact that my program might not be so interested.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign of his own.
It will cover the cost of the campaign, in fact, what I receive senátorský salary.
But it would house without a job, for example, I couldn't pay my son English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
I just wanted to make money, so nekandiduji anywhere.
So you're going to continue to do so that you can live?
Didn't you that these activities utlumíte?
But it has nothing to do with the amount of salary.
As I promised, I partly out of their activities.
For example, the travel agent is going to happen in the spring of my deputy.
People would want me to be a Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I need something to live.
How much did you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 000, which I take away.
And if I were the president, I ended my business.
The entire interview can be found in the Saturday edition.
The architects MVRDV are evidence of the fact that the real adventure are only in my head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Montenegro books - 2 Sides
"The building seems to be cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, is once again to see something interesting," said Lisette Verhaig, which goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the nearby a large firm, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
I do, however, ask what else today, we need the library.
They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old-style now voluntarily nobody goes, yes or no?
Spijkenisse, in close proximity to the Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, holding a special record.
The municipality with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this silly situation, the decision was made a few years ago, contribute to a general education and build seven painted miniatures fictitious reinforced concrete bridges, which are prominently displayed on the euro banknotes.
The success of educational offensive but not spectacular.
And so the city's officials recognized that there is only one possibility, how to become masters of the statistics: We need to have a library!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely brave column graphs and the contractor humorous, often even cynical buildings, the thing with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003, with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the Commission still stunned, looking around and shrugged her shoulders, piling fresh Maas their gifts, according to the size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear urban community!"
This is my proposal to the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million euros piled.
It is part of the revitalizačního project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and rank-and-filers home with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November was a mountain of books will be honored second place "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town gray, which still could offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly Hall, whose white facade you expect more dairies, it is thanks to the richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
But, above all, is now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of their existence.
The long journey to the book
First impression: Reading Eldorado under the hatch of the cheese.
Means of the Massif mountain ride the elevator, but the real space and reading passion to control the topography.
Of all the parties with glass interior is bright and clear, and the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
Urban environment is perfect.
You can see the dog park benches, and the boys and girls who play football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the shelves with books along the facade, and in the middle is a big dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built a classic spatial configuration upside down, and the space for the reader, we went up from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly exploited: In the middle of the office, the library, chess club, ecological center and control techniques.
Special comfort are black shelves of books, which are lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes railed stairs.
The appearance, structure and the smell of the alien.
The unknown building material shaking their heads even avowed architects and engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager for the urban community Spijkenisse, the Standard magazine.
And so we are in one fríském farm one day came to a waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as the basis under the roots-millimeter fleece of synthetic material.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textiles lasts one or two seasons, and he is ready to blow up the bulky waste.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - pressed down on the plate thickness of four inches.
By the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Commission on Human Rights) in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps to get to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey will be rewarded in the literary cafe, not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus trees in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly the right humidity in the literature.
Gifts for the new soul
"I think you wouldn't believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass model project, with regard to the ecology," says Trouborst.
Heating and cooling the earth's heat.
Although the books are under glass, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.
The broad glued wooden beams, which stands at right angles to the glass facade, serves as a shield, and pick up a large part of the solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Traditional Chinese medicine, and also a teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as the "long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: Each of the people of the city a few weeks ago was invited to the opening of a book of his personal fund.
So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently has 70 000 pieces.
The concept has been proven.
The shelves are crowded.
"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation to a new house now has a population of a relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it was just for show.
The MVRDV worked in the royal discipline, which, in the jargon shaping identity.
Spijkenisse said the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
It is, in the end, the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the decision-making process on the adoption of the Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle, Germany in the early week at first suggested that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinians "observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support it, what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think that will not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - without, of course, was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
That ultimately put NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and the direction of the policy, which was co-chaired by the US, so to speak, in the direction of the German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult, that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between two lanes.
It is expected from them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think, in his role as before settling down, but they are on the way to the "normal" foreign policy.
On foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain.
Specifically, what is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It shows a readiness in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, the export and its relationships with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other major powers, and that is why Germany must protect their interests.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict, and the vote at the UN?
Firstly, Germany has a large outlets in the Middle East, particularly in countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful to discourage the public, but even the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
I don't want to, but not to give too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
In any case, however, it plays an important role in the German considerations.
Damage Germany's relations with the US, Germany, in the case of two important decision-making, for example, abstained in the vote on Palestine?
I think in Europe and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I don't think that was so dramatic as a breakthrough in the issue of Libya.
Perhaps even from Germany to gain some respect.
It's a signal that they must be considered as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for the veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences existed in the wake of America's internal politics.
I think that the Obama administration has a great understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I think that the diversity of views are not so big, as they always seem to.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too happy with Netanyahu's policy.
It is not difficult for Germany to harmonise their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and the position of the EU's most important partners on the other side?
I think that's exactly this that makes it difficult for the Germans.
For Germans, of course, would have been a little easier if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently happening.
Therefore, cannot be part of a wider line and must instead of pushing things forward of their own position.
That's what they were doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
It is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role of a major international player? He wants to take the major role?
Or is a leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany still not used to it, it's still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons for this country is still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role in post-mood.
It does not facilitate the Germans.
It is, in fact, an old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and views, and it is not easy.
The US influence in European politics now is constantly falling, the EU, however, this vacuum currently circulating. Who's left?
The Germans will have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, they're going to do, and it is even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!

"Protection of the brand" in China: When they are Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani's world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is it Armani Polo?
It is the designation, which is completely officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
However, enjoys protection, so long as it is nezažalují the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether the law before making purchases.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of the Taylor Wessing, which specializes in the protection rights violations in the Far East.
Each week, lands on my desk a new case.
In addition, the counterfeiters just a few letters, so that they can submit their brand.
Gucci, for example, Lu-Gucci and Prada instead they register Prada-Kyus.
In this way, they are legally copied and German firms, sporting-goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file with the Trademark Office records in Beijing.
14 September 2010, left one Chinese firm to protect brand Ermenegildo Zegna Zegna DF Puma artificial name parazituje at the fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in the copying and infringements of intellectual property rights.
In large cities are multistory malls, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeit goods.
But there are other Pattlochovy cases on behalf of their clients is opposed to Chinese firms received from the Trademark Office officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," the Associated mark.
The word is focused on the "Bang Dakuan."
This meant women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It is damaging trade, we have to combat it," Pattloch calls.
"Mark is diluted, monopoly disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in the precious sample products.
According to the company's market research for CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, and the third largest market luxury goods market, which is growing as quickly as possible.
Deletion of dubious records in the register brands can be difficult to achieve, however, and that's worth something.
The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of the cases in which the court rejected the claim, because the name has become a contested after a long period of time, "the reality of the market."
When the plaintiff is bad luck, must still pay plagiátorovi, because the damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements.
In 2009, he lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, company, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps at the concrete mixture.
Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star.
The company Geely bought Volvo, originally used blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
2.3 grade point CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too much of a small number of staff and premises.
But in the last year, allegedly "the work of the emergency situation back to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed Statement of Objections dropped by 22 percent.
It was concluded 57 000 of these cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, waiting for the office of 81 500 complaints still pending.
To do something against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, it is an impressive numbers.
In the last year has been CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of brands, which is almost a third more than the year 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China maintains a list of new applications for the tenth time behind throughout the world.
This is true even for the number of all existing trade marks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
It simply means that each log on at an average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
Start against the dispute is several times, as shown in the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
The group has more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans had achieved that canceled his illegal production imitovaných car parts.
But the forger had secured the rights to the brand Freudenberg continue.
We neglected it, because they cannot be protected name in Germany, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management of the company Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
2.3 grade point CTMO then also Munich firm rejected.
In two other instances, Freudenberg tale of the law, but the defendant in the case is fighting today.
It is necessary to keep a watch
It is now a matter pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company had to even look at a hundred years old writings to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg opposing party vainly offered "a high figure the amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what it means for us," says Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East and Europe.
And in the case of the imitators unprotected brands.
One Chinese producer in Germany, for example, wanted to log the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of business activities, the group gave up a long time ago, but still managed to avert the registration.
"It is necessary to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advises German companies to be very cautious in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law známková. Foreigners would rather have "everything that is in any way for protection, as well as in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama will succumb to the mark, then I guess it will have to pay royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be in the contested segment pushed out of the market.
World Aids Day: Thumping, singing, aid
In Heidelberg tested the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland have pleased the orphans after the parents, who had died of AIDS.
The story, which is far more than the 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the sound: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's shoes and men's loafers are looking for on the dance floor tact and quickly found it.
One-two-three-four.
Then he slowly swell voices singers - bass, alto, tenor and soprano, urging, extorting and mutually encounter.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it almost rises from its textile shoes, combining voices his legacy wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg tested the choir Imbongi a new song.
It came to the band and the singers between 23 and 69 years ago, human genetics researcher from the porter.
"Om 'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and more in a foreign language - Zululand, eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland.
Aid to the self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that around the world live around 34 million people who are infected with HIV.
The 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245 000 orphans after the parents, who had died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphaned by parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found the group Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend school of second instance.
For 15 or 20 euros a month can take over the operation.
Tuition fees, a school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means in the language of the Zulu "a storyteller," or "one who extols."
No one to speak fluent bantuštinou fails in this area, only to sing.
For almost ten years, the choir rehearsing songs in this strange soft speech, and sometimes it's also brings back there, which had originally come from: South Africa.
The air distance 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in the Northeast Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which is dependent on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected with
There is some 2,000 people, some still in a simple clay or straw huts. A large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni is seen in a small, how sick the whole infikovanosti Swaziland: The highest rate of HIV, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which reduces the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carries the virus weakened immunity is not a rarity that die in less than thirty years.
This village in the common way for Africa in the spring of 2005, but above all the members of the Imbongi saw many children in the streets, which lacked only parental custody, but everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without a complete school education in a poor country had no chance.
At first, it was still the deployment of private individuals, which for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But a year later, the group was founded "Voices for Africa," which has since taking care of orphans after the parents, who had died of AIDS, almost professionally.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most sexually transmitted disease?
The bacterial SPI syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Frequent viral SPI are HIV, the human papillomaviruses, herpes glandis or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies belongs to the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea is found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted sexual contacts between the men.
In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is between heterosexuálními adults extended relatively few of us, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
Among adolescent chlamydiové infections are significantly more often than other groups of the population.
According to the European polls, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
In addition, between juveniles frequent human papillomaviruses.
As the number of infections?
Not all of the sexually transmitted disease must be reported.
The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute, from 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 disease in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007.
The year 2011 was approximately 2700 cases.
It is about one-tenth of less than a year earlier.
What signs point to venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulties in passing urine, discharge, pain in the abdomen and vesicles or warts.
Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
The danger of the disease may reduce the condoms, but they do not provide 100 percent protection.
As part of the sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the event of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examination.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent the consequences later.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, honorářům, which the choir singing throughout Germany, gather some money.
"We have a total of about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni sent," říká předsedkyně spolku Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who can impose.
Also, to orphaned children found shelter, for example, some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as they say in the language of the Zulu old women are the backbone of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, give them a roof over my head and taking care of it, so that the children arrived on time every day in their uniforms to school.
The children, who no longer have to go to a shelter, Khanyisile, lonely woman, which the group, as well as two of the cooks, the daily cooking for more than 200 of hungry children.
"For Africa," established a school built two chicken coops, and together with the American Health Organisation PSI arranged that many people in the village had HIV test.
It's not granted, even when the disease is in the whole country is so obvious, all is silent about it.
The king of 14 wives
"Aids is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, strange enough in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his expected lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
The state approved a way of life is also to blame for, among other things, that the HIV virus in the past few decades, spread so quickly.
But even many migrant workers, who took over the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is used.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "
At least a little to support cultural exchange, travels the choir Imbongi once every two or three years after South Africa, and he sings songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the days of apartheid.
A busload of white people who sing songs in a speech blacks - such valuation is not only the mood and joy, but also has already sparked tears in many of the wild border troops.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children, over which the patronage.
Although this village hardly can be found on maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than the familiar.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," they say the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, who is here as the crow flies 8733 kilometers to dupajícím singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.
NASA discovered the ice on Mercury Messenger:
The probe Messenger found evidence that the ice on the planet Mercury.
The thickness of the ice cap could have up to 20 meters.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even when it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as is clear from the three studies, which on Thursday published a magazine, "Science."
The probe Messenger found evidence that in the area of the planet, which lies in the shadow, there is ice cap.
It is alleged to have at least 30 centimeters, and maybe even up to 20 feet thick.
The water seems to come from comets, or perhaps even from the asteroid belt, which came into the Mercury.
But none of the award of ice in the context of the existence of life on this planet, "said leading scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature of the Mercury may be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help explain how the water and other essential elements of life in other regions of the solar system.
The probe, telescopes and little robots as Phoenix, nepozorovaní Earthlings, participate in exploring the depths of space.

Our eyes to the universe: The most important telescopes
The telescope Galileo Galilei allegedly invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before it a year later, he used to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks that broker, are still deeper.
The world's largest telescope was over a period of 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror image of this should be five meters in diameter.
Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope in the US.
Allows you to look into space by two mirrors, each of which has an average 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is a huge mirror measured at an average of 10.4 meters.
The mirror the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented labour-saving costs.
Yet his average is about 11 meters.
However, the disadvantage of low-priced construction: The telescope is secured hákovadlem in high-rise angle, which is limited his mobility.

Scientists are based on the fact that it is the ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger circling the planet far closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurements showed several decades on the ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first one, which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists are now safe.

Driving range Talyš we call wildly romantic.
The bus rumbles along the road, with many curves along the heavily wooded hills, wild rivers and farms.
Everything is green and lush, almost seems to be that we are in Schwarzwaldu.
But this is the farthest south Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
There are Caucasian ethnic group Talyšů, of which it is not known, in addition to speak Persian ázerbájdžánsky and living to a very old age.
The terminal is Lerik.
This town is too monumental architecture of Soviet times, which is in a picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe's arrival here comes from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It is necessary to 323 kilometers eight hours, because the road is only jednoproudová.
The fabulous wealth, for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea, here in the country had not yet arrived.
Pilatus Fatullayev (48), however, is convinced that the Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May made famous by the Grand Prize Eurovision Song Contest - and we here next year, we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatullayev.
Longevity is the director of the museum, about one in the world.
There is a documented life nearly eight dozen Talyšů from the area, who are more than a hundred years. Fatullayev shows black-and-white photo.
It's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years had fathered a child.
The star of this museum is, however, a shepherd sheep Şirali Müslümov, who allegedly was 168 years.
The birth certificate, however, does not exist.
And, given that the oldest man with the documents was 122 years, it seems Müslümovův age extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and 1973 died," says Fatullayev.
The man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children aged 136 he had fathered a daughter.
He therefore Şirali Müslümov at his age for a few decades?
The ancient people in Central Asia, however, he heard the Rembrandt gerontolog Scholz, of the Max Planck Society on in Rostock.
"A lot of people age living in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also on Sardinia is extremely many very old men."
However, due to a lack of supporting documents cannot be made no scientific proof of age, especially when missing from the registry office.
Every day the glass of the reconstituted butter
But the fact is that the people in the area around the Leriku living biblical age very often.
Currently, there are 20 people, who are more than 100 years old.
Why, then, live here in the south of the ancient people so much?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains specific genes Talyšů.
The director of the museum Fatuljeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in nutrition.
However, that was just calorie diet Talyšů, who love meat, bread and milk products, and many of whom daily drinking a glass of the reconstituted butter, is so healthy, in terms of bromatologického seem credible.
Or is it the old way of life that keeps people young in Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In the 97 years at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which argues that it has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground with máselnicí relentlessly rolling.
Eight people live here under one roof, among other things, one of the sons and daughter Mirzajevy. They are no longer grandparents.
Around two small children.
In the kitchen, preparing for the guests of tea, which is administered in the typical-glasses ", he."
White teeth Mirzajevy consists of a series of hidden under a scarf and a long, dark blond braids, which proudly before us reveals her son.
I've always washing my hair milk, so I looked and maintain the color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
The monthly pension for life
Always eat only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have never bought food in the supermarket.
He tells me about her husband, who was in the Army.
It was the worst in the Second World War.
But things improved when the oar took the "beloved father Heydar Aliyev."
The propaganda from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which makes about his father, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
He was in power in 2003, then took an oar his son Ilham.
The old people in Azerbaijan at least suffer privation.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euro). This is the sum of which you can live well.
And maybe he's right and grizzled son Mirzajevy: "The old people enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
She returned to Cairo revolution.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep ambivalence of the country.
The sharply debated on the future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for that we can do it, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended to the entire nation, but mainly Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular parties.
They still hopelessly squabbling in a confused the opposition, because they are afraid.
Fear of "God's" State of the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologetically told him that temporarily reduce the powers of the Constitutional Court and spread your to save "revolution."
However, what he wants 61letý engineer, who has the title of Doctor of the American University of Southern California, really, to save the world, nor the Egyptians are not clear.
The judiciary has to be stripped of power?
234 sections, which stohlavé constituent assembly, dominated by Islamists hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, part of the cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, he says, even in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what is meant by "the principles of"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists this vague formulation and associated legal leeway to use for stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least it's newly added section: In all matters relating to the Sharia, it is necessary to deal with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it may mean that klérus will carry out supervision of the legislation, which would have brought justice de facto withdrawal.
In the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also, the problem is that it has to be continued civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody to 11 000 civilians.
Standing in the proposal, it should also stand to protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values."
It is legally worded so loosely that it would use this section may even state institutions to control the content of the film art and literature.
In plain language that doesn't mean anything other than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing does not define an explicit equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits aspersions or to defame the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
It remains unclear, however, what it is and how it will be prosecuted.
The same ambiguous wording that it is forbidden to "insulting people."
In this case, the caricature of a president or a joke at the expense of the law?
The case of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Mursí present for the signing, and according to his words will be "very soon" to present the Egyptians for the purpose of the popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks, the shape of the opposition outnumbered by Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unity Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo, and promised to destroy the constitutional document, even before it starts to pay.
"The revolution is back, and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbáhí, who was placed on the third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft constitution "belongs to the dustbin of history."
Through the short message service Twitter followers accused Mursího that they want to carry out "a coup against democracy."
"If of a referendum, we will go to the palace and toppling him," said Yasser Said, a member of the opposition.
"We're not tired, the blood of our brothers have not yet been punished," she quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several of the judges announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become null and void.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared vzdorodemonstraci, out of caution, however, not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other side of the Nile káhirskou University.
She participated in the many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who called: "The people of God's law."
Called Mursího: "Clean country!" And assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all started, it would probably trigger a civil war.
It's Mursího supporters clearly didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide which direction the country has to go.
It is considered to be a majority in favour of the proposal by Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear even one"
Forced the constitutional dispute, which should continue until February and integrate all social forces, ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa du.
Forty-eight defenders of human rights, and the president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were in prison or under Mubarak stood before the court.
Not because they shared their ideology, but because for him, that human rights are indivisible.
It was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now in the new constitution are the words' human rights' or 'Welt am Sonntag in an interview for once," she says. "
Mursího extension of power to all three components of power in the country has forced the resignation of a lawyer.
These measures are scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game, and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead, the president to strengthen civil society, in fact it is cancelled," said Sa da.
But without civil society organisations democracy cannot work.
SA da feel abandoned by the international community, which monitors the game ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could easily backfire.
The protestor in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: Most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway is enjoying one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
The secret of success of the country could be associated with the local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheese.
Put them in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it there for a week.
You get a sense of smell paralyzing the smell of rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and the omnipresent stench hangs in the air.
Rakfisk is salted fermented trout in the water for up to a year - depends on how much you want to fish stank.
As the dark and cold, beginning with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet at the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, nejpodmanivějšímu appetite.
"You can eat it raw and then zapijete glass shall be," says Havard Halvarsen, the local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk" the general, who is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes fish with large quantities of alcohol.
"Some people have aquavit rather than the rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink may trump the smell.
A few pieces of try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, who had been on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when the poverty in Norway, and because there was no fridge, fish in the autumn dipped into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, and ate - senses dulled alcohol.
Only a generation ago thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave his country and look for work, and most of them have emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of the immigrants are attracting a large amount of work, with high wages and extensive care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.
The rakfisk is viewed as something important, an indispensable, even though a stinking, part of the past.
One of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway is often lacking in the global news - and it seems that most people like it that way.
The name Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremists, who in the last year, he shot 77 men, women and children, people still refer to with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called the "event of 22 July."
The Norwegians may be hard to believe that in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
For the current wealth of Norway's growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the beginning of the 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says the administration of plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and startling blue eyes is the prototype for the Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the English of the majority of the people here, it is absolutely fine.
Don't... Grandstand, we don't like flamboyance.
Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of most of the money from this sector invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial meltdown threw money, which didn't, the Norwegians had at its purse strings tight.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And the rakfisk to eat," he adds with a laugh.
Standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I've had enough.
The elk burger is certainly something else, and it's nice juicy.
But the evening's smelly fish here again.
The hotel, in which I live, is one of the many places where the rakfisk for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most demanding fish.
They have a connection with a live television transmission, in which he is the host with a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.
It's like singing Eurovision.
"What you score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"
"Here's our scoring, Håvard."
Applause and laughter.
The man fell out of his chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes of all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a tough start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges facing, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is clogged with even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was to prevent dojíždějícím in order to get to work, but to prevent protesters from gaining access to the Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President Enrique Pena Nieto Mexico received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Face a daunting task.
Mexico, at the time of the outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has an estimated 60 000 lives for six years.
"My government has a big commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction of violence," the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this objective.
Before he shook hands with the American president, president of Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state Mexico.
There are different views on the new leader, as well as in his old homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital city.
Direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember the good.
The citizens he attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
You can now get into town after one of the new motorways, which let Pena Nieto to build the highway are a huge improvement from leaky and rugged roads, which have been here before.
His name also hangs on the wall of a modern sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the MP for party president Pena Nieta, institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI).
In particular we hope in an interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy, which our country so desperately needs.
After continuous 81 years in power, the PRI party ousted Vicente Fox.
The Member Olvera admits that after 12 years out of the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the intra-party from Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.
And the opposition refuses to comment characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.
It's a very straightforward man, very biased with excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that has many people of his former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad, cannot be contrast with the cobbled streets Valle del Bravo clearer.
Tucked beneath the traffic overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.
And the problems in the region are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called in to help with the management of the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially poignant is violence against women.
Only in the last two years have been deserted places beside a huge waste dumps littered the body dozens of the murdered women.
At a time when he was governor of Pena Nieto, was murdered in the State of Mexico, more than 1 000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, Pena Nieta critics say that in his time in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of murders of women.
And, in the worst case, accusing his leadership of the closing of the eyes.
In the concrete house, typical of a run-down neighborhood, shows me a photograph of his late daughter, Mariana Islands Irinea Buendia Luna and crying.
According to the official version of the Marian committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, so it looked as if someone had washed her body," says Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of the strikes, and has already begun rigor.
As her mother tells the story, Marian looking down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which is a single word: "Justice."
However, this is how the family says, exactly what they had been denied.
State authorities were to me, as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka.
They want you to simply accept what they say, and silent.
"But it can't be right, when there were many errors and omissions," he says.
The sash, president of Pena Nieto received on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years have been tens of thousands of families affected by violent crime in Mexico and the new president promised during his tenure in office will be his priority.
"I hope that it will be the same as president, as he was a governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member PRI Olvera.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad fears the most.
Bradley Manning complained of ill-treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor trying to rebut claims Bradley Manning on the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing is aimed at his residence in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to make the case was rejected on the basis of gross Manningem treatment in prison.
Private is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is seeking to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in the history of the US, has missed many opportunities to complain about the rough treatment, which allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein during cross-examination of Private Manning at the preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that the records weekly visits that Manning had links with officers during the nine months at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of ill treatment.
Cross-examination, which took place during the hearing at the request of the defence to reject the case against manning because of the rough treatment at the time of the links, which is in itself sufficient punishment, took place the day after what Manning testified to the fact that he thought about suicide.
Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing the military prosecutor Fein, together with Manningem forms that officers fill after meeting with Manningem in detention at Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011 held in high-security.
The officers manning questions and his answers.
When he Fein Friday on the forms, said Manning admitted that the treatment by their guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional."
The forms showed no complaints of ill-treatment, even when the officers asked Manning directly on how it is handled, Fein said.
Manning said that the concerns relating to the various problems to express orally, and that the officers who visited him, talking to him about these concerns and indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, did not.
"No problems," wrote, "(after the debate concerns), and it's not necessarily mean that I have to mention it," said Manning.
The judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why the treatment of his person complained in January 2011 at the meeting with the commission examining suicidal thoughts, which a few months earlier expressed in the form.
Manning said that, in the course of this meeting was his intention to reduce the "prevention of injury."
The army said that for him the restrictive regime (one degree under the supervision of the suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted to be in detention guards knew that I was fine and that I wanted to abolish the system injury prevention... to enjoy enhanced the quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transported to the detention center at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait, and once there because of the heat fainted.
He said that he was not allowed to know what will happen to him, and what is happening in the rest of the world, it was very depressing.
"My world had only to the base Arifdžán, on the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
Manning said that after his arrival at Quantico spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattresses, blankets, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said that he was trying to walk, because sleep, or just the camp was in the course of the day against the rules.
Manning said that he always slept with light from outside the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned in the night, on the other hand, woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer lodged a formal complaint to the treatment of Pvt. Manningem in January 2011.
Manning was in April 2011 moves to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked the accusation, which raised in Thursday's testimony, on the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates in the morning.
Manning testified that when he was not allowed to hide his blanket.
At Friday's hearing, Judge Manning said that the order of their guards decided that the blanket, which might be postponed, but admitted that he was ordered to have no one has gone before.
On Thursday, Manning testified that the night before he was forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that he is not dangerous.
Manning said that the officer, said that he could use the belt of his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that the night was removed from his cell his underwear, his slippers and glasses.
His lawyer, hopes that the judge will take into account of his experiences during his detention, and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense argued that the plans that Manning admits guilt in the lower crime and that he will fight against the other accusations, because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon said the declaration that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all inmates held in a maximum-security detention.
Among the charges against manning belongs to aiding and abetting the enemy, the illegal disclosure of the intelligence documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he may be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are out there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital, Mexico, I barely pushed through the crowd, and I came into the room for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.
Arrows pointing to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and all my life I was called "Mexican."
It is an ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston as "the Irish," and my friends in New York referred to themselves as "the Italians."
So, I ended up in the "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides interview in that language.
I don't have, however, vocabulary of native speakers, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited in the White House, President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual business, which, when the leaders of the two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the same probability that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.
Pena Nieto has promised that it will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though did not provide any details.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought to the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of weapons replace half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
A minute later, United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And the kids Montezumy walks on the warpath.
And yet it is the real challenge for Mexico relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country, which offers possibilities, and others don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, it is that at some point our family tree was the person, maybe a parent or grandparent, which in Mexico was denied the opportunity and he had to go to the north.
And more often than it would seem, this person fit the profile - dark skin, a weak education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico's.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but it is not our loyalty.
It is against the United States.
Beyond that, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
He sees us as a reminder humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, he would have never left him.
And we now foundation imprisoned for silk curtain, with the good life in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and in his childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that there is a tension between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because the Mexicans more understand who they are, and Mexican-Americans resent it.
Even if it is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.
And, at the same time, many Mexican Americans, which I know feel as part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
Get the best of both countries, but you don't have one.
In Mexico on us is viewed as the Americans.
And we considered the Mexicans in the United States.
And to complicate relations, they want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, to reunite with the Diaspora.
They want to Mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as "ambassadors" and represented the Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and pressure on political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.
Well.
It's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And, thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
It's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States acted with Mexico in front of one and a half century ago, so it must accept the fact that some of the Mexican-Americans still feel uncomfortable for the manner in which it was treated with their family members in significantly more of the past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we Mexicans, "" more than I thought.
The old battles, the new Middle East
Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas would still could be the basis for peace.
It can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, has been amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis and, for the first time fell rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even when it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in his ancient conflict, all around them, change the Middle East.
The Arab Spring has changed the old calculus and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe it means that the fight will be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that at the present time, there is not much reason for optimism.
Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, the fight from this week to strengthen hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which rules in Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the poorest global and the most populous parts of the world, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.
In addition, Hamas leaders may very well decide that time is on their side.
The Islamists throughout the Arab world have greater influence, so that Hamas has acquired a powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, revived regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, joined on the side of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people call from Hamas, the Islamic crescent moon circles around the north of Israel from Lebanon, where the ruling party militia Hezbollah through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, above all, on Israel's southern flank changed the rise of Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous Arab country, and the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, not Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced public opinion.
In a future Hamas diplomacy may appear as a player, who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will reach the opposite conclusions.
In military terms it was Hamas back into the box.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron dome proved their worth, and many of the Hamas rockets had been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for the moment.
In diplomatic terms, America is as solid as always, many European countries also blaming Hamas from the opening of the latest round of violence.
And, most importantly - Israel prosper, in particular, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protecting Jewish settlements, which are still growing, despite its illegality in front of international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections held on 22 January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If you really have ruled on the West Bank, it would be neodpalovali rockets, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we stick to the wall and hit them with sticks his head.
Maybe hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Even though the Islamists, who gain power in Egypt and other countries have Israel too in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
The Israeli defense spending is higher than the expenditure of all four of its Arab neighbours together.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, it is a good sign, and it may be the start of something new.
The Israelis also would have to look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates the denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day in the areas Israel occupied explode - as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Currently repression weaken democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is that reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: Two states, Israel claims the territory due to security.
In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this case.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar must work to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state was more than an immediate offer virtual sovereignty to the United Nations.
President Obama also has its share of about how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term neglect the presentation of its own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia have entered into force laws on cigarette packs
The heaps of green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are illustrated warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.
Entry into force of the Australian laws on the packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors brands to replace general olive green boxes of ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body and the views of children and infants cases as a result of their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are required from Saturday the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the same small print.
This is the strictest in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.
He relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26 years, is a 99 percent chance that they never smoke.
"Even in very young children, you can see that he understood the message, which is trying to sell their tobacco companies together with their product," says Tanya Plibersek Federal Minister for Health and cites studies that have shown, for example, that the children in the log with the idea to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
Tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that the law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to a cheaper and more abundant.
"Thanks to this legislation is a serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia would bring a lot more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Another says that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, said that the demand on cigarette packages of silicone used to cover the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal on the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company Zico has sold almost 6 000 kusů wholesale dealers and expects the new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible snag experts argue the popularity of social media at the demographic groups, to which the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and requiring that most vendors hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and Internet sites, however, cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're marketing worker in the tobacco industry, and there is only this small space for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space insurmountable place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the evaluation of the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average John."
We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and put the work and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focused on how to deal with the new regulations, rather than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the assault of the new rules - the country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly.
The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has led talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce a mandatory warning pictures in 2001.
Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are resisting.
The pictures do not have any effect on me.
Just ignore them.
"Just think you pull out a cigarette and a box of your back," says Victor El Hage when buying boxes of photographs of tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, who owns moichandise King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, argues that, thanks to a single packs is harder for him is to offset the shelves.
"Unloading it took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government would simply was completely banned, then we would have said: 'OK, that's the end of it, closing up shop'," he said, and threw up his hands.
In a world of constant connection is not so bad, being bored
Last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical trouble, and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development is increasingly coming up with praise nudění.
They say that, for us and our children) is a good thing sometimes bored.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And given the fact that most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have a chance to boredom.
We should therefore support?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to it.
Firstly, as well as many of the people I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, occurring with the arrival of more free time.
But as he says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canada in Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (history) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, has a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, dating from the first century A.D.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, "said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After watching the research literature and brought to the target group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I've been able to."
Boredom is different from apathy by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that there is apathy in the urge to do something.
He says that at the heart of the boredom is a "distortion of the process associated with a bad mood and feeling of rushing past time."
Boredom can remind a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, when people tend to see the problem as the environment, or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem themselves.
Sometimes, we think that's boring, then, when we only have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups have heard loud and non-television program in the next room, others heard it so low that he barely noticed, while a third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble with concentration, but they weren't sure why, and attributed the problem boredom.
When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult task, it can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as the search is wrong on the factory line, distracting music can help with that, to be bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that the twisting and drawing, which is often regarded as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to stir more to learn and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenske.
We all sometimes boredom experienced - my flight delays, the speaker, especially a lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance of bored than others.
To help with the measurement of boredom scientists in the 1980s had developed "Living for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale covers issues such as: "Many of the things that I have to do, and it's monotonous," and "I have so many interests, that I don't have the time to do it all."
Using these scales of scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, "said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular, as regards the need to have more, and various external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times daily contact with almost 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of the adolescents said that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents reported that they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.
He said, however, that he knows that "adolescence is the time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Boring is good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo an absurd physical risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, "said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way of the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't know there's always the best thing you should do.
If you're bored and use the energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it.
However, if you watch television, do you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give his iPad, he won't be bored, but learn how to entertain itself or separately to drive, "said Professor Fenske.
"And this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child learn only how to entertain itself, but will give greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical to her.
Our aim should be to feel more comfortable when we are out of the reach of the business and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We are accusing it of the needs of the more boring, boring, but it is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
That's what people are looking for, in fact, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is hard to find ways to entertain, when the noise."
In Colorado there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana
A 19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at higher vocational school and football player from the southeast Colorado, is facing charges of crimes as something that will soon be in the entire state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and pipe, which he used to her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day rode with a couple of friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - petty offences, which is fine for each $100 - and he was set the date of the court.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the weeks after the vote on the Colorado legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use hundreds of smaller drug cases, the answer depends on-the-spot, rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington, which has approved similar measures, canceled.
The police department to stop blaming adult at the age of 21 years of age and older for possession of small quantities, which will be legally permitted after the entry into force of the law in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in conservative districts Colorado have declared that they will continue with the existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western hills votes on preventing the opening of new state licensed stores, with the marijuana in their communities.
"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The gossip and regulators in Washington.
And they're looking for instructions on how to set up the licensing system for the cultivation, production, distribution and sale of - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, it is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana for medical use, and now a recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol of the State of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or the system cannot do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent, according to which we could drive," he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, shall take effect December 6, which also left the annual vacuum, during which there will be no state licensing system, but legal possession of, yes.
And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance state directive relating to the "appropriate" approach to the licensed marijuana, with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, playground or children's centres.
"There will be more difficult to place a licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, the recently-based research group.
21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will no longer be prosecuted for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each citizen aged 21 years old, and that the police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws regulating medical marijuana growers, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck stricter look.
After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment.
Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offense, which was crimes at a time when they occurred," Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The reaction has been complicated in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected joint initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, has already grown blame for possession of small quantities.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports the decision, but also decided to reject all pending cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm losing my time continuing in law enforcement, as long as it does not change," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing the recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
It is for the district prosecutors' cultural barrier, "said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, and the local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of his life, the prosecution of people still cannot accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states, which have a small quantity of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the cusp of becoming the national test cases for the legalization of the drug.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new frontier for legalised the sale and, at the same time, anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates the legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice complies.
Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and those who use it, which have attracted attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in the operation.
While protidrogoví agents may not be out the door, to pick up a small bag with the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing state regulated business with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, "said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the administration of President Obama's drug policy.
Several Colorado cities waiting for federal authorities.
Even before the election day some local governments have approved moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before he will be able to open any trade.
Last week the city of Montrose west of the State has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone we license, and then we will have a federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against the amendment.
We're looking at it, for what the municipality voted, compared to what passed state.
There is really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave from Oxford, because I'm a conservative."
Their views are being attacked by today's college students.
I don't remember that I ever dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford.
As my father, my older brother, studied at the university, which I thought that it is the world's leading knowledge-based, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And while I'm at the end of the 1980s, in the twentieth century within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed her bags and slammed into the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up, because I had objections to the students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from the battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I have been subject to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I've been persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of enlightenment, it was perceived as a bigot, so barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a high-ranking adviser Margaret Thatcher and a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why it until now.
Just because recent reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right of center is suffering from a similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of students demanding the same protection equal rights to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, argues that because of his political views "are often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and they made clear that they were not welcome."
The creation of a position in the university's Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can communicate freely.
Their situation didn't help, nor the BBC Two documentary recently named Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Stories: Young, intelligent and right-wing student politics, which he described as odd conservatives and neo-Nazis.
The agenda was introduced to graduate Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA Conservative Association at Oxford University), which drove Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a walking stick with a silver head.
At other universities conservative students say that he is with them due to the introduction of higher tuition fees treated as a "scapegoat."
A 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the University of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské), he told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without meeting with us at all. "
Said a student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, which stands for the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is "bad," while a 19-year-old elected the president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the JCR members access to the people on the right side of the centre of the worsening.
"It represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During his first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I got in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.
Hatred against the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.
A year earlier University voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists shivered concern.
During the first few days in the opening week, when the new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which was supposed to come.
I found that not only professors tacitly approving conservative pupils, but with a taste even participate in it.
The paneled auditorium was diverted policy mining strikes, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture about the text of the 18th-century French translation into English, and that's what happened, I wasn't ready.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "the first paragraph, please."
It was hard enough.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like dessert dough, it was a lot of bilious.
"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" He asked.
The other students snickered.
Tears came into my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in his spare time, so if you're not too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.
Heartbroken, I returned to my room.
At a dinner in school, I sat alone, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.
It was a sophomore named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said softly.
Unfortunately, it is so.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is a target.
For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.
Most of the conservative freshmen pretending that they are labouristi.
Later in the local pub I tried to pretend to be.
I insisted on the fact that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick has proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You're daughter fascist pig."
You are infected.
The other students notovali with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How conservatives love?" Asked one.
Hitting each other, right?
I felt so, how they feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever to lead a normal life in Oxford?
I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?
I would have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?
Three years in front of me like purgatory ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who had resided at my school.
Sadr was not only for the fact that he is conservative, but also for the fact that he is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.
Almost there.
He hated the place for his parochialism and pettiness and for his shift to Marxist-deterministickému view of history.
In 1997, took the place of a professor at the University of Bilkentské in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to commute from Oxford to his parents' house in London, seeking refuge in his partisan metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s were accepted by all political views.
"But it's the best place in the world," said pathetically.
It didn't, not in the city of dreamlike mood.
Even my communist friends have always been perfect ways.
His moist eyes troubled.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week in the course of the teaching, when the next history professor in utter seriousness, "he said that I was an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was inside the blushing with shame, I said to my parents "brainwashed" and called it "the old fools."
The relief was short-lived.
My father hammered the nail in the coffin of my career.
At the time, wrote two columns in the newspaper each week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside and after five minutes of my pursuers.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never returned.
You can call me usmrkaným wimp.
But there was no 18letá girl or boy in education should not be subject to such intimidation and virulence.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, of which not only 14 conservative prime ministers, but also to this day, hiding behind undeserved reputation as the place with the equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has elegance rather than glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of fashion," which was launched this week in London, talking with ABC Naty Abascalovou, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszovou and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence Isabel off his back, English is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the exhibition Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer said at the opening of the celebratory retrospective, "Valentino: Master of fashion," which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio for the last 50 years.
"I love this," he says with his unmistakable, an Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story, in which it is "il Signore" Garavani only protagonist, but without his cherished clients could be written.
Valentino has always felt charmed a rare and distant world aristocracy.
The first room of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, full of private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from the Princess Salimy Aga Khan across the Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England after Lord Snowdona.
Valentino exposes those personal memories as trophies of his social rise: A simple tailor from the town of Voghera in the north of Italy on the international "forgo royalty."
Like there's nothing wrong with the royal family.
"They at least netípnou smoke cigarettes into a fine carpets, as do some wonderful celebrity pop-music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino's impressive host and guests enjoy abundant and with grace.
"We are all very pleased when we were invited to his cabin in Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heiniho" Thyssena and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelliová or Eugenie Niarchosová.
"Valentino was always elegant, rather than glory.
And even so, he's a star. "
Valeria Mazzová Valentine
The charisma designer Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we after a parade in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome went to him for dinner.
It was twenty of us, and between the two of us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decor, food, music, and felt his spirit.
They invited him to feel important and loved ones, "says top model, which began to work with him during Paris fashion week summit in 1995.
"I never goes out of style, because his proposals are works of art," concludes.
The parade of nobility
Gravaniho life story is not an obsession, but really opětovaných ones.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries Somerset House was converted into a distinctive seventy meters long passage, which offers an exchange of roles: The visitor to change the model and marching passages to watch the "audience" dreams, which is wearing Valentin's masterpieces such as clothes, which chose Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassisem, costume, who wore a Monica Vittiová in "Night," or a coat of wool and fur, which belonged to the Empress Farah Dibaové.
In the audience mannequins September names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxisu, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, "cannot be forgotten."
"I remember it perfectly.
It was the pants, shirt, vest, "Gillette" and a jacket from a collection of autumn-winter from the years 1971-1972.
It was a gift, which he did for me, "says Naty Abascalová, one of návrhářových muses.
"I'll give him in front of the other priority for his femininity and a great love for women, because underscores our beauty," added the former Duchess of Ferii.
"I love the colors, which uses a lot of rozjasňují and give the" spark "face.
The proportions are perfect. "
Neither the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d '5 cannot forget how he dressed for the first time, Valentine's Day.
When she was growing up, and lived in Italy, she wanted to be an adult, and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes.
Finally, at the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first clothes from the Valentine's Day on the occasion of the celebrations at the castle of his cousin, Prince Edouarda de Ligne.
It was a red dress, a skirt with flounces, billowy bodice and the top of a strapless.
It was a dream that became a reality, "says the widow Rodriguovi d '5.
"Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d '5 has saved návrhářovy ceremonial dress "very carefully... because the clothes are not just clothes, it is also a set of memories, which are in themselves."
"The King" fashion
The centerpiece of the exhibition at Somerset House, a wedding dress Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Pavel Greek in 1995.
The creation of the ivory-colored silk dress with panels pearls, 12 different types of lace and a long four-and-a-half feet were the need for four months of work and 25 "girls" (as he calls the designer of his seamstresses).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkesové, the greatest authority specialised press, these clothes represent a milestone summit fashion the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients of high society."
Valentino dazzled during the years elitist "savoir-être" is now the best example.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated order of the Legion of Honour accumulate as much as any of his clients.
"My attention always attracted his vybranost, quiet, neat and perfect appearance," the princess acknowledges d '5.
"The last time I saw him about a month ago at the gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
It was a perfect time to leave no trace. "
When she says it.
The toughest job in the world: The sulphur in the area of the volcano Kawah Ijen
Four of the euro in jeopardy in the area of the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, when 70 kilos of sulphur down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who work in hell.
This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners, who earn their living from Kawah Ijen conquest of sulphur from the volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of that must accompany each day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases from the interior of the Earth, and in contact with the air passes into a solid state.
After all the big blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carried on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it is only 250 meters, but exhausted bearers takes over 40 minutes before the tortoise pace up when it rains, because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected his steps to ensure that they haven't and nezřítili into the abyss.
They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as happened one French turistce, which collapsed years ago from the rocks Kawah Ijen.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which yields
When they are at the top, making her way past the tourists who took them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, and tired is hard to the basket to the weight of the mining company ranked slightly below, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in a volcano benefit since 1960, and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, entertaining fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"Because normally carries 70 kilos, earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, which usually carried out three trips a day.
One way he takes three hours, and at the end of it is gone, but he can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems insignificant amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what would be made on the field.
"The daily wage miners here is very high, for example, the collection of coffee to pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for a fortnight's two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, of serious reason, which is as convincing as sulfur in Indonesia: "I'm married with a young girl from Bali, a Hindu, and I took her to Java, to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes has a toxic gas
In his 27 years of Kawah Ijen Anto three times daily risking his life in a volcano, whose sulfur had already begun to collect their toll, although his face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes has a toxic gas, which escapes from the volcano.
This is the price we have to pay for it, in order to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for another two years, because I want to open up trade or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.
This charming and intelligent young man in fate could be tourist guide, the waiter or the clerk at the hotel, and instead of doing the work.
Shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers, and every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur in the night and continues to build up its distinctive yellow and blue glow in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto into the crater and illuminates the way a small lamp, which is mounted on his helmet, and he bought her for their money.
About 400 porters carrying on their shoulders the sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, sulphur production because of the cost savings nezmechanizovala, nor does not provide porters working on his own and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, do not receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) bonus for photography, which, together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) collected the natural park from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," argues Madrusin, a burly 42-year old porter, who works in Kawah Ijen in three decades, from the time when he left the school.
 He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that will work, "as long as you can," because he needed the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and miners in thick fumes from the volcano is based, the miners are saying that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... it is, however, clear from their frequent respiratory problems, into arthritis pain on his shoulders, knees and wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, in his 53 years may have only 50 pounds.
Every day, he and his colleagues in the volcano vydolují 15 tons of sulphur, which then three trucks transporting steep path between the trees to the warehouse in Tamansari far 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life," says Unainik and opens his mouth wide, which is missing a few teeth.
The oldest of his five sons, a 30-year-old, also makes mining sulphur.
Time passes, but chronic poverty remains one of the toughest in the world from generation to generation - craft, which are engaged in human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singapurci enticing, that they do not have children, career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore needs population growth."
I'm married, and I'm a patriot, you are my wife and you're a patriot carry out our his civic duty and zploďme new life!
It may seem incredible that this is part of the advertising slogan LifeSavers, yet - or perhaps because of - the video at the beginning of this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rap, which uses local hints of the type "give a cake in the oven" like a mockery birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising agency BUT, which created video, hopes that they can this advertising to draw attention to the problem of humorous way.
Artistic Director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of the music to the people to fulfil their civic duty. "
"It is only a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject to which we have to touch it.
We knew that the government was trying on a lot of things like to extend the perfumes with pheromones, or to organise dating parties.
Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not the most creative thing, such as the composition of the rap, in order to solve this problem. "
1.2 children
The one who takes it very lightly, the Government of Singapore.
1 annually spends $300 to encourage people to have more children.
Government package for marriage and family provides up to 15 000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and allocate financial benefits.
All these measures have little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy Southeast Asian city-state with advanced technology, also known konzervatizmem of its leaders and strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the structure of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a peace, recovery in 1976.
Why Singapurci have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, Director of marriage and the family of the National Agency for the population, says that it is because of "better education," and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it's not only the marriage and the family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to delay marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in fertility rates in Singapore.
While in the framework of the immigration policy, there were efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a precaution against the decline in the number of inhabitants, it has caused resentment among the local population.
On some of the Singapore's Web site to see the overt xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and little desire for integration.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party Singapore last year recorded its worst election result since the beginning of the independence.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem by using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility rates are well-known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, expenses in health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to oppose many small home.
For example, began to affect trade in real estate.
The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain urban areas.
These apartments have 46 square meters and had great success in marketability.
However, there is a fear that these apartments can promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build a large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the developers EL Developers, claiming that their "shoe box" sold far more quickly than larger houses.
"They are more popular, so that they will sell for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger size.
Therefore, they are much better for our cash flow. "
He admits, however, that the new rules are clearer rules developers, who were previously limited, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city-state.
Although the new rules could be directed to an increase in the birth of the nation, the conversation Singapurci working in the financial district in the centre of the city suggests that they will not have a big effect.
"People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people," says the young officer.
"The others to have children.
But for me, it is important to rely on their own time and money, "says another, about a 20-year-old young man.
Men and women cite career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons, which prevents them from having children.
So let the government seeks to citizens of any force to have children, they are eventually Singapurci, who have the last word on the setting up of the family.
What's private is private online and offline
Privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, is something that is personal in nature or the "area of private life, that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption."
What's privacy for people under the age of 16 years?
Applying this definition in their day-to-day life, and on social networks?
Means the dangers to which it is exposed when published on the Internet business, which would certainly didn't tell anyone at the normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, the concept of privacy for "something entirely his own" on a personal level and for "username and password," if it was a social network.
"I have the greatest mystery published," says a ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"I'm pretty FB photos or pictures, how we are playing.
He also says there are known.
I could not share the photo, which would have been mine, or a picture of someone, "he says.
This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, photographs of naked people or photographs of the crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says that he knows all 35 friends, which is the FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother, who has a name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started an account on Twitter, to be able to express their views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if someone says to me, I'm just giving them there, "adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk with relatives who are far or fast to communicate with your friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says, that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he didn't care if he had been recommended by a stranger.
Fourteen-year-old Jose case is different.
The teenager their own accounts on the network of Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at last the network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from its list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy didn't instruct him none of them, even after it didn't address or phone number.
"If I urged or required it from me, it is simply remove from your account," he admits.
José volunteered to Ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana).
"Well-known friends on the social network was being blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never found out who it was, "confirmed.
The victim, according to Jose neodhlásila from the account.
"It's just that triggered the private mode."
Then a series of steps, explains how the account set up safely.
Unlike Jorge this boy published photos of well-known in the unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would have done it, if somebody would or should I just wanted to.
Even though I know that it is cyberbullying, "he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, a teacher of English and a graduate of the Education and teaching, has it that children and adolescents in social networks correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
States that: "The Internet was created as a means to search for information, but when the social network, has changed the rules of the game."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that the academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of Yale University and the author digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"The digital natives are children and young people who were born in the time of this technology.
We're digital immigrants, who is we have to learn, and yet they still learning, "he says.
He explains that it is a complicated issue, "because it is asking to see what it is appropriate to publish and distribute, to say and what not, on the contrary, in an age when it is not yet ripe."
Also, to be reasonable, at a time when what he wants is to be the most popular, have thousands of friends and tried not to think about the consequences, "he adds.
According to the Specialist is the most effective way of children and adolescents to show what's privacy, asking questions, which makes them think.
"Tell them to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.
In addition, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: There are things that you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone published a picture of how you published a pal's?
Do you know what the other published about you?
When are you calling the person in the pictures of the celebrations, the person you asked for permission?
And one more: All they need to know what you're doing?
The other point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"A man outside the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles and the same would be on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, college professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If understand every guile, have a good basis for it to play with children talked about the consequences that establishing an account on the Internet may have.
For example, in terms of age, or of what is allowed to share or to publish, "he says.
 Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children traditional rule "don't talk to strangers."
The summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today, ended without a statement from Lima, which indicated that was allegedly signed by the seven presidents.
The agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of the organisation of the Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidential office, who set out at the beginning, that the document will be published at the end of the summit, said that at a later date will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
It is further claimed that the content of the Peruvian president Ollantou Humala has been published in a few short press statements.
Journalists have limited access to the information for the duration of the summit.
During the negotiations in the press room was transmitted by video from the presidential meeting without sound with the message "confidential meetings, the transmission of sound medical practice."
A small amount of information that they had available to journalists, was granted press spokesmen of some governments, who were present, but not the Peruvian spokesman.
A single document published during the negotiations, the list of participating presidents, causing hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who demanded more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office e-mail to the media, "the final declaration" of the summit, but it is only an expression of President Humaly, and not an official document, which concluded summit.
Last October the third summit hosted by Peru Jihoamerických and Arab countries (América del Sur-países Árabes (ASPA), and even on this occasion was originally promised the Lima Declaration published, even though it was required.
The official website of the ASPA may find that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings to the Peruvian authorities on it, in order to ensure the broadcaster for all journalists, but completely prevent the flow of information.
The summit ended, inter alia, a common commitment to Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Court of Justice in the Hague, which deals with the dispute on the border between the two countries.
President Ollanta Humala Peru and Chile President Sebastián Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which starts on Monday after hearing a defence of both parties to deal with the case, who initiated the Lima against Santiago.
"We will obey the ruling, which resolved a dispute, which we are debating today in this international court," the president said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be the country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñera and greeted the president Humalu handshake at the flags of both countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents, that are to be subjected to the judgment of the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week adopted Bogotský pact, which has expressed its submission to the decisions of the international court, which ruled on the sea border with Nicaragua and Colombia this decision considered completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay has been excluded from the organisation of the Unasur in 2011, after the appeal of former President Fernando Lugo, and did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for the start of the morning speeches and the conclusion of the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, which reported that it was adopted 16 agreements and action has been scheduled on 31 projects between the South American countries, with investments amounting to 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the agreements adopted mentioned that the UNASUR member countries take "important steps towards the goal in the form of American citizenship, for which they are distributed to the Agreement on the residence."
Informed that they are supported by the actions to improve cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, better access to drugs and low-priced Internet in all corners of South America, and to the common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters. "
When Europe is in crisis, "does not have the economic consolidation (in Latin America) winning the substance, but is intended to increase our productivity and show a better future for our peoples," he added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects, which will improve transport links various points of South America, especially rural and border areas of our country to be better integrated and create new economic ties," he said in a speech čteném Peruvian president.
He mentioned that five of these projects relates to Peru and cross its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two are related to a better connection with Ecuador, more details, however, has not indicated.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to her back into the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues that the summit was the need for Latin America remain a prosperous and peaceful areas, which is solid, and he has a good-neighbourly relations.
In this sense, said Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos before its participation in a regional meeting, hoping that he would meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico, to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime border dispute, which is disputed by Bogotou.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions are not excluded, no contract with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he pointed out.
"I hope that I'll be able to say to the President Ortega, to lead the negotiations as civilized and kindest possible form," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico, where they are to take part in the inauguration of President Enriqueho Peñi Niety.
At the summit, the EU defence ministers provisionally met to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the defense field.
Members of the organisation UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, even though the country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary president of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe's integration
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, today announced that the establishment of a common citizenship is an objective, in which the "South America, in this case, you really must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential Jihoamerické Union Nations (Unasur) summit in Lima, said in the state TV that the Europeans' killed in World War II, "and in other conflicts," but now they are practically one country. "
In this sense, defended the project the creation of a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the organisation Unasur support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the South American country, which is already underway between the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary area, which we want to return to the past," he said.
Ecuador's president, expressed, inter alia, that agrees with the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that the impact will be reduced Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
"Those who are in the lead, never to do anything, and we all Latino men, on the other hand, sign.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is financed by the United States, "he said, referring to the political asylum from Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa has confirmed that he has no regrets about this decision, because it betrayed its principles and respect for his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He said that at the time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."
In addition, criticized the Swedish justice, who asked him to be examined on Swedish territory because of an alleged sexual offence, "the Swedish legislation allows you to carry out the examination videokonferenčním conversation, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that Assange will result in a deterioration of physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he's in the embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a small lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorean head of state.
"But there is a risk that his physical and psychological condition deteriorates, because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would be affected, "he said.
President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June still earlier Ecuadorian embassy in London, on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and pointed out that the London talks in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of the WikiLeaks.
"We're not negotiating on human rights, in this case, we don't use such a word, but still continued talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because the lawyer Assangeův Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in the various European instances, "said.
He said that "if the United Kingdom will pass tomorrow, everything will come to an end."
And if Mr Assange to Sweden still earlier Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the legislation without a problem and, as has been done in other cases, tomorrow will be accompanied by the end of this problem. "
Correa took advantage of the situation to be presented as a defender of freedom of the press, and make it clear that he does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, which undermine freedom of expression."
The biggest enemies of a free press, we're not mean-spirited and vicious politicians, but bad news in the service of the profit, coercion and blackmail, "he said.
From this point of view, expressed joy over the fact that no such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic countries and even bourgeoisie Ecuador," and said that, if re-elected, "will continue in the changes in the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to maintain a veto expressed by Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur, at least until the next elections, and argued that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and pučismus wrapped in the legality," because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, Ecuador's president, said that is "entirely appropriate" the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time after the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
At the moment the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between the South American and-friendly countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome will walk together.
It is necessary to assess the wide, to have been overcome, and there was a chance to go forward. "
He also expressed the hope in the settlement of the dispute on the maritime border in the same court, which deals with Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international resort, where the two countries commit to accept the judgment, no matter how hard it will be."
In connection with the possibility that he would run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to run for a third mandate, he said, that sees this option "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, goes from public life.
"I personally never cared much, but it was so unfair situations, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only correct political power.
My political movement believed that it is I who guarantees the likely victory, so we have to accept this responsibility, "he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term, and then I would leave from politics.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
I've decided, "he said.
Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez has gone to the planned routine treatment, and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the health of the president, "he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian state today participated in the Sixth Summit of Heads of the State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was brought calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain the development, equality and safe.
The victims of AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of his test: HIV-positive.
"It was like lightning struck me," says the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "mitigate" a little bit, but apparently without success.
The boy's family.
He decided to take his own illness on their shoulders and began to inform, and that with such commitment, to celebrate the 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the earliest Unit HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after a battle with the disease.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
Then, with him, the director of the clinic, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) said good-bye, "because he was cut."
Then AIDS have been synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live with this syndrome.
It is, however, a lot of people who don't know about his illness, and when the virus caused the destruction of the organism and vysílil immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since the world AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases of, "is a great success, that the life expectancy of the patient, who in a timely and appropriate manner with the treatment, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and a specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that, since 2008, AIDS is not a judgment of death, but that the survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system, patients who are diagnosed with the disease, the better are those who use drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells, up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the one who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with the treatment of live without problems up to 75 years old," the doctor said in an interview.
To highlight that progress, it is appropriate to remind Mexicans, the average life expectancy today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico dropped the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics on 60 percent of the patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and in May, 187. However, since 2005, is a universal access to antiretroviral therapy.
 - Why continue to the people of the consequences of the disease die?
 - "It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's the way I see it, this is happening for us in the hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of supplies of medicines. The problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease. "
Adds: "Nine out of ten patients comes when an Associated infection. The only thing to do, we could have more impact on the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier and, therefore, it is to be on a large scale to offer tests for the detection of the disease all persons who ask for them."
In its proposal coincides with the specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who had come to a private lab tests to do just that he did his friend, and despite his low age of AIDS and also suffered from cancer, Kaposi s sarcoma, which is one of the most common complications.
"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and don't want to know anything else.
"If I have to die, you'd better be vyřádím three times a week," they say, but it's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. "
His parents still knows only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I am an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to himself and to the other person, "lists Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge, to share their experience with the daily Milenio Jalisco today, in the framework of the World AIDS day motivated their testimony to those who are worried.
"Whatever they do tests. If risk, then let him know as soon as possible, and if they are HIV-positive, it is better, and if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, will be held accountable."
This message summarizes the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
It's a big gap between the programmes for health and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who discovers information regarding the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps in prevention.
In places, which is dedicated to this task, "is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," said.
Among the nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want?" Is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school staff advisers, pharmacies and medical staff, which adolescents want to avoid, the reporter says.
He suggested this inefficient distribution of condoms are not just behind counters, but a hundred is located in dávkovačích on public restrooms, in places where young people often.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
"It's not to pay them a beer and a motel," as the governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district.
Takovásexualita isn't the best way is to make condoms to those who had sex life, "he said.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
It was recorded 13 435 cases (12 158 1 317 cases of HIV and AIDS cases).
The situation in Mexico is fourth place in the new and recorded cases of AIDS and 13th place in the context of HIV.
92% of sexual diseases is on the way, 6% y 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that some 50,000 people with HIV can live, because on the one registered a case is four to five people who don't know about the disease.
The judgment by the Court of Appeal in the United States, which does not recognise debt restructuring the company Grupo Vitro bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for any national enterprise with offices in a neighboring country, and the problem of solvency.
It seems, then, that corporate restructuring procedures, which allow Mexican laws in the country lanes and stars, despite international agreements.
Approval of the judgment issued by 15 June last year, the judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas, in practice, the Mexican company without a defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the Mexican producers of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities.
First, it should be noted that while the judge this case argues that the creditors have to follow Insolvency Act of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth district, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would suggest a lack of international cooperation in cases of insolvency multinational companies.
In fact, the model law was created for the purpose of the United Nations for the reunification of international trade law, the arbitrator determines the organisation of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling stipulates that without a vote of branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, it would not be achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility of the Mexican laws allow.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which it was adopted this scheme.
There is a half-dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose transfer debts guaranteed the Federal Institute of Technology.
In addition, it is true that even after the deduction of branches of the creditors - who stood against the company Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. funds "vultures," such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - achieved majority.
In the vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.

Héctor "Hetin Reyes:" Basketball has been my life '
The basketball world traveler Héctor "Hetin Reyes was linked with this Salo sport for more than 60 years and traveled all over the world.
Very few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories of the history of the local basketball, as has the Héctor "Hetin Reyes."
Reyes had been, before he was caught by a stroke in 2008 in a wheelchair, dedicated to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player younger categories, the National Basketball League player BSN, owner and coach the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the National Basketball League, or the president Portorické basketball federation.
"I was in the course of my life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, like when I was in the 1990s, president of the National League for BSN, general manager of the national team, and president of the federation," said Reyes when visiting reporters newspaper Primera Hora at his home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years, with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes in his statement wasn't exaggerating.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenir items from his long career, it suggests.
Bayamón in the heart of
With the greatest emotion of all those which are reminiscent of his tenure at los Vaqueros since the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time, the celebrated 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team.
"It was my best years, I've enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be with the team los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in eight World Cup, either as the owner, the co-owner or trainer.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years since 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one playoff - in 1981, when he made his debut in the BSN Jerome Mincy.
The team then took the "Cuco" Ortiz, who had been an outstanding leader, "said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously coach, and by the time he was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me: 'I got you a burly 6-foot player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended as well be handing them Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team, and one of our best shooters.
I remember that, "he said that if Mincy Bayamonu victory in the championship, then Gausse will contribute to the next."
The championship, when he played for the team los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, because in 1988, has pursued President of Basketball Federation.
At the time, he wanted to devote his functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
"I remember how we beat the United States for the first time in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up neighborhoods, but we have a bronze if it weren't for the Canadian referee, who let us repeat the final face-off, "said Reyes.
It is the team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team, which you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the man who defeated Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was a national team in Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we whippin team in the United States, which was very similar to the one that blew the bronze at the World Cup.
The team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico Lopez and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of knee injuries.
The team, which may not have the perfect composition, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, it was the team from the Olympic qualifications in 1995 in Argentine Neuquénu.
With the players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players ruled out because of the fighting in Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions we won the gold.
What was the best player Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
The number of international tournaments are impressive.
None of the Puerto Rico achieved at this level of the results of such as Piculín.
Not to mention his involvement in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, to which Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I very much like the work of the young Leo Arilla.
His success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the era's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s was the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.
 What are you couldn't prove it?
There were things that I wanted to put in place, such as the division of youth categories according to the regions.
For example, that the boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the children a lot of travel and play games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in the mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistants arbitration, and an arbitration.
I'm delighted.
What are you now?
The most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I'm enjoying grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

The course, which examines the "end of the world"
Each week, students examine the apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester course about the end of the world, he knew that it is an irresistible lure: The end of "a number" of that old Mayan calendar, which has come December 21, caught many people as proof that the world is coming to an end.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: The catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call "debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, the place where Christians teoretizujících about the end of the world.
"I didn't realize that this will be nejapokalyptičtější semester, ever," said Charmé students this week Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When the man finally, what is going on in the world today, as if we had 30 days, it's a really good time.
And remember, that is bad for apocalyptic-minded good.
And it's not the only professor, which offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is, in theory, the latest in history.
At the University of Temple assistant professor Barry vacker course "The, culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students examine the apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We have been discussing why these ideas with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios, which is governed by a human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war could erupt.
This month, students analyze films with apokalyptickými themes and examine how it differs from the examples from real life.
"I was trying to inform students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," says vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history of Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, Assistant art history and anthropology, to hold the course with a simple name End of the World.
"Nepřipojujeme" 2012, "because we are always with the possibility of a rate again in the event that the world will not end," said Restall.
Despite the impending doom, "" students must study, create projects and do the final exams.
Penn State will be the final test on the eve of the Apocalypse, which makes students with no option but to work into the evening assumed the end of the world, "said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"Spread within two hours," said Restall of its rate for students with a high average, of which a total of 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received an e-mail questions as to whether there is still a place.
The students themselves have been assured that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console ourselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And, therefore, apocalyptic, secular or religious sentiments, it is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Wekesa, a freelance psychology and nursing student, said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard about an hour before, in which it could teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no vyzpovídaný student, let alone a professor, said that he believes in the date of the end of the 21st of December.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan predictions, and in some ways it vyvracíme," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá student last year at the University of West Chester, Temple.
"The Mayans never, had not foreseen the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he said that there are apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries back, that people respond to changes in its surroundings predictions about the end of the world.
The speculation has caused the Internet to flourish.
"People don't think about it elsewhere," he said.
This is happening in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, on the question of whether there knows about a course on "the end of the world," he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not the end of the world," he wrote, and suggested an exception in the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall said that during the years of talking about the last days of the court, and said that if nothing is going to happen on 21 December, "people will start thinking about the next date," or philosophy, 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, at the end of the world.
The date of taking lightly the students and professors.
Several of them said that they intend to go to the festival, "the end of the world."
"I guess I'll call a few friends, we laughed together," said a 20-year-old communications student Samir Ford.
