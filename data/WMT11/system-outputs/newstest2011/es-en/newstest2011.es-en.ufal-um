What explains ? The ČSSD in Prague does not know neither to Voldemort neither the confectionery
The new councillors of the ČSSD in the capital go to have to surpass, seemingly, the evident linguistic barriers so that the components of the Board of Prague and of the municipal Council understand to his renewed mates of the ODS.
The period Aktuálně.cz "Examined" to the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to check his knowledges of the tongue marked slang that has arisen in the last years in the Council, when they governed Prague the current members of the coalition.
The dictionary encoded that used the flower and born politics of Prague during the previous period, of the mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the characters, situations and causes more known of the metropoles.
Surprisingly, it has checked  that the new councillors almost do not comprise these known concepts.
At least, this say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I do not know it."
"Rather I am a novice in the political praguense", affirmed during the examination of terminology of "colegueo" the councillor of culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And regarding the political veteran, reacted the same Karel Březina.
Perhaps they know the concept "hoyo of golf".
"Possibly it was the only expression of all those that asked me that I use from time to time."
"If no, usually no employment slang."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz The past June before the congress of vote of the ODS, the editorial chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related with the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "main hoyo of golf of Prague", "go to the confectionery", "nape of bull", "betrayal of the capital" and "armour".
Three councillors accepted to subject to the test and a chamber, Antonín Weinert, that in future will be responsible of the education in Prague, at the beginning accessed, but did not go back to take the telephone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, denied  directly to do it.
"I do not put me in these things neither think to value how amuse  the civic democrat."
"What himself matters me is how will understand us in the execution of our programs", signalled.
As it has seen , purportedly the councillor Lukáš Kaucký had not given  account that the previous title is an expression on an influential employer and a fellow of the exalcalde Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say him at all; the only term that hit in the examination is "the hoyo of golf bigger of Prague".
"It treats  of the tunnel Blanka", says Kaucký, that adds immediately: "But rather I know it by the news."
"I go me to have to aim to a course of languages", kids.
Karel Březina is not the only that recognises in the hoyo of golf the tunnel Blanka, but also the councillor of Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both sociodemócratas know who is really Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where find to this character; besides, it suspects the meaning to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that it wants to say go to a company of Prague"; soon  desvela to Plachý that treats  of the headquarters of the companies of Janoušek.
To the equal that Březina, indicates that such the knowledges obtained them of the news, but that does not employ such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the proof, between the sociodemócratas does not exist any so familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked to my mates, but really seems that we do not have at all seemed."
"Rather, between us we use apodos, sometimes abbreviations or do games of words with the names", says the president of the ČSSD praguense, Petr Hulínský, whose mates of party call Hulda.
"In the school called me Bříza, but do not know if my mates also call me like this", confesses his own apodo Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz Put to proof the name and works.
For his mates of party, Weinert is Děgive (similar to "yayo") or, less amicable, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with which associated  before the elections deceptions during the sponsorship of the party, receives the apodo of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by part of some of his mates.
The apodos also are the only expressions that the sociodemócratas tolerate in the speech inside the party.
To Hulínský does not like him that they call him Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz Discovered even other apodos for this president praguense.
"The doctor of the rights of the sweeps" seemingly remembers that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in Right in the academy of police of Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "witches", as it published in a brochure
The women considered like witches in Burkina Faso share some characteristics.
They are used to to have an age advanced, can not work, for example, for reasons of health, are solteras and do not have children.
The women that go back "" witches send  to an isolated zone, so that they do not prejudice to the rest of the village.
"The rare men time suffer such but."
"Neither it isolates  to the healthy young women, because they help in the works and have children", explains a monk that, in the capital of the state of western Africa Burkina Faso occupies  in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled of his communities.
The local Government has decided oponerse to this unusual "social measure".
It issued an informative brochure that it would have to contribute to avoid the hunting of witches.
However, this has one hits.
"More than 70% of the adults in Burkina Faso does not know to read", warns the newspaper Die Standard on the disadvantages of the sensitisation by writing.
The indictments of witchcraft also are common in other African countries.
In Win, neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the past week died Ammy Hemmah, of 72 years, when three women and two men tortured it, covered it of petrol and burned it.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors affirm that it was due to a miserable cumulus of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman  prendió in the oil that uses  for the ritual anointings.
prendió In flames when the group wanted to "expel to the bad spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" support it people of all the educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted to an employer of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The devoradores of human souls always represented a danger", affirmed.
Whereas in Burkina Faso the Government tries to appease the hunting of witches, in Gambia the year happened still participated in her the president.
"The president gambiano Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunting of the witches that, purportedly, had state related with his death and had tried to kill to the president himself by means of the black magic."
"To help him brought to shamans of the near Guinea that, protected by policemen, military and the escolta personal of the president, carried  by force to men and women chosen randomly between the villages gambianos to the property of the president in Kanilai", signals in his report the organisation International Amnesty.
In the finca, the people arrested had to drink a pócima of grasses with effects hallucinogens that, besides, caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay in the finca.
After the international pressure, finally freed to around one thousand people detained.
The tenant of Bakala: it heats  with stoves of coal and signs a higher rent
The man, of age advanced and recio, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the client of the company RPG Byty of the "tycoon of the coal" Zdeňek Bakala, the proprietary elder deprived of flats in rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm carried some documents with the new agreements for hire of three flats: his, the one of his daughter and the one of his son, that is fulfilling sentence.
To the three finishes them of pillar the liberalisation of the rents.
In place of 3.500 Czech crowns to the month, the son will pay from the next year 4.100 crowns by a flat of two stays with separate kitchen of second category.
"Besides, it does not have of hot water and the heating bases  in a boiler of solid fuel", sample with the finger the man in the new agreement of his son, on whose signature has full powers.
"But I signed it", it explains half angered, half resignado.
The civil association Bytyokd.cz, that described the new conditions for hire like "wrong and indecent", recommends to the tenants that do not sign the new agreements and that expect until 7 December, date in which it will publish a guide informing on how proceed in these cases.
But, in front of this, the man so only does a demeanour.
"Each says a thing", says with bad expensive.
Ostrava is turning into A big laboratory of proofs of the liberalisation.
After New Year will occur with the big majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were until the moment under a rent regulated.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz Decided  to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The room of mining wait of RPG is one of the four of Ostrava and, the Tuesday to the nine, already was full.
Justo beside the doors are the policemen of security and to his side a machine to take number.
"Rent 2011", can read in a luminous button of his tactile screen.
When pressing it, goes out of the machine a confetti with a number.
Almost it does not give time neither to read "157" and already the number appears in the big screen situated in the high of the room.
In a second, you are in the tail.
Shortly after, it arrives a marriage of age advanced to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here by the new rents.
The majority of the people comes to solve usual problems, as in the past: applications of arrangements, questions of the safe and similar subjects.
The letters with the new agreements for hire will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of the majority of the 44.000 pertaining flats to RPG around mediated of November.
RPG Byty Proposes them in the letters an increase of the rent of between the 15 and 38%.
On 18 November it opens  a ventanilla special in the centre of attention to the client for the new rents.
"It carries working a week, so it is beginning", answer, after doubting in brief, the workers that find  in her when the client presents  like journalist.
The liberalisation and the ancient flats for miners of Bakala are the most delicate subjects in the zone.
Before the elections, already treated them high and clear the vice president of the Parliament, originario of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the zone.
"Twenty years afterwards want a new soil."
"Neither they changed me the damned dish of the bathroom",  desahoga the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, by the moment come more than at all jubilados to check if they receive a discount in the rent if they sign to time, as it promises the special offer of RPG.
They will receive likewise the half of the discount on the rent of February the remaining tenants that sign the new agreement before 15 December.
Nevertheless, the ventanilla of the "mining" liberalisation definitely does not attain to dissipate the avalancha of doubts.
"Of the 360 clients that were here yesterday, so only asked after the rent in 2011 around forty or fifty people", estimates the employee of the ventanilla.
In the meantime, RPG proposes in the web and in his tablones realise individual meetings on the agreements when it was necessary.
If the two parts do not arrive to an agreement on the rent, will have to solve the question an independent judge.
"It does not treat  of a threat, but of information on the only way to proceed possible and entirely according to the law", warns RPG in his pages.
"Here it does not go  to judge to anybody", thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man that finds  in the street in front of the centre of attention to the client gives him, at least partly, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13.000 and remain me 5.000 for the food; I do not have half to attend to the courts", affirms.
But, immediately, the employee seeds the doubt.
"Already we will see".
"The gentleman Zaorálek warns them in the means that they do not sign, so perhaps the people expect", thinks.
The regulation of the rent will leave to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic to starts of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, his increase is an economic need.
"The current rents still do not cover not even the cuantías necessary for the maintenance of the bottom of the community", remembers Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential wallet of the company RPG Byty, that adds that the neglected state of the bottom of the community that angers to the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
Whereas during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in apartments four thousand millions, in the four years that will go of 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 millions.
The big screen that hangs of the ceiling, in front of the seats of the room of wait, now repeats some data that resaltan in red.
"The increase of the rent in the year 2011 in 15% and less applies  to 31.200 apartments, that is to say, more than 90% of the properties of RPG."
"Besides, always it will be at most 7,50 Czech crowns monthly by square metre", indicates  in the screen.
So only increase in 38% the rent of 400 flats of the wallet of RPG.
"In such cases, treats  of an increase from some extremely low quantities, of 19,66 crowns by square metre", indicates RPG.
In 2.600 flats, the rent will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty Promises that the liberalisation will not affect of hit to the rents, but  escalará between four to eight years.
Besides, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the rise of the rent (consult the chart) again in the flats, mainly in saving in heating: new windows and heating.
They will have priority the people that sign the agreement of rise for hire.
The architects have understood that the offices also need kindergarten
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
Anybody would say that it hides also in his interior a small kindergarten with all the own to such installations: walls of colours, creative pieces of furniture and even a park in miniature in the external terrace.
From October of the past year, can attend to her the children of the employees of Arch.Design.
The company of architectural projects Arch.Design, of whose study went out numerous buildings known of Brno, thought from the first outlines of the building Avriopoint in including a space for his miniguardería.
In the company work around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow that the architects and delineantes could go back prompt to the work after the motherhood.
Together with the possibility to enjoy of a schedule reduced, the kindergarten is one of the profits that offers Arch.Design To his workers in the frame of his social program.
The constructors and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The miniguardería was an idea of the own employees of Arch.Designu And, with the support of the direction, attained to obtain finance of the European Union and of the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The miniguardería of the company funds  through the Social Bottom European in the frame of the operative Program of human resources and employment, as well as of the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the finance conceded (an endowment of more than 2,8 million Czech crowns) could buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When it exhaust the finance (two years), the company Arch.Design Has the obligation to keep in operation the miniguardería with his own bottoms during three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and in the presentation of the application of finance contributed the company Economy Rating.
The attention of the boys is in hands of qualified personnel; besides, they are presents all day for his cares a nurse and a professor of the Ministry of Education. The kindergarten at present receives to boys without limit of age, although the majority of them has less than three years.
Since it treats  of a "miniguardería", so alone can receive simultaneously to a maximum of five boys, although with the turns attend more during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible to adapt  to the needs of the parents and the boys of all the workers have the same right to use the kindergarten, independently of the hierarchy inside the company.
Although it treats  of an education and individual cares, the contents of the program of the miniguardería are comparable to the program of the usual preschool education.
In her the boys no only play, but they also receive an education of quality: from the basic learning until the preparation for the school, teach until English.
The class no only has of toys and board games, but also of a computer for the boys.
The presence of small boys in the own company create an amicable and positive environment.
The parents can go to see to his children anytime and avoid the stress to collect late to the boys of the school when it finds  far of his place of work.
Like this, the parents are more productive while they work.
It does not result surprising that this generate of natural form a relation of loyalty between the worker and his empleador.
In this way, Arch.Design Situates  between the companies sign that they offer a big advantage for the admission of new workers: they support to the family and, in definite, this program reinforced the marketing of personnel.
The house of the bones follows fascinando after 100 years. They observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof seems the lomo of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remember to the column of a dinosaur and the balconies seem the mouth of a fish opened.
Like this it is the House Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of his similar form to a skeleton, the venues the apodaron "the house of the bones".
His organic forms, his striking colours, the new utilisation of the stone, the fragments of azulejos and mosaics, a façade that remembers to the flakes and the omnipresentes lines softly curvadas, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with oneiric lines, delicate colours and textures taken out of the nature and of the fauna.
Loaning more attention, observes  one some geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order.
At night, all the façade of the house seems still more impressive, since it is lit of such way that improve  the shine of the colours.
It meanders and the torsion of the forms follows us surprising also in his interior.
The wood ondulada copy the frames of the windows, the rails, the ornaments of the doors, the peepholes and the signs.
The House Batlló, that finds  in the neighbourhood of Eixample in the number 43 of the animated commercial street of Passeig of Grácia, arose of the remodelación of a house of the year 1877 of the architect Emilio Room Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house completed  in the year 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted in demolishing the previous building and begin of zero, but soon accepted the idea of Gaudí to realise a new reconstruction and cheaper.
However, the House Batlló, formed by diverse apartments, did not design it Antoni Gaudí only.
It collaborated in the design the architect Josep María Jujol.
In fact, in his planes of the project arose ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the façade.
In the also hard-working façade other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the House Batlló was the start of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol Participated in the construction of the House Milá and of the park Güell of Gaudí, in which they find  other pieces of the same.
Because of his organic form, the venues shortly after his ending the apodaron "the house of the bones".
Others, because of the opening specific mechanism of the windows began to call it "the house of the yawns".
It says  also that, in the high of the construction, appears the sword of Saint Jorge, pattern of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudí projected in the house an only system for the period of central heating with breathers of ventilation and the chimeneas typical.
It can result odd his inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the norms of construction of the moment and did not leave  influence by them.
Still like this, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in him the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vagos that, two years afterwards, to his ending, the city council remained  so impactado with the result that asked that it corrected .
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even until the public sidewalk.
The arrangements never realised , rather on the contrary: so alone fifteen days after the application of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two higher flats of the building.
In the inferior flats installed  the own owner.
In the gallery of the second flat found  the living room and in the third flat the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The low plant rented  to a jewellery.
The house, of six flats, is entirely crossed by some stairs that carries until the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them of walls curvados.
Gaudí worked likewise with the modern concept of connection of the space.
The common part can connect  entirely opening the doors of the living rooms and a main group can communicate  in this way without problems, without that renounce  to the necessary privacy for conversations more intimate.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, no only obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional flats.
It results impressive likewise how plays Gaudí with the light, azulejos white and blue that cover the inner playground and tragaluces.
The game with the two colours contributes the maximum of light in all the flats of the house.
It based  simply in the principle that the white reflects more light that the dark colours, which by the contrary absorb the rays of sun.
Any person can visit the House Batlló, that in the year 2005 added  to the list of world-wide heritage of the mankind of the Unesco.
In the first flat of the house finds  the apartment more espacioso and more recargado of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, with occasion of the 150º anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits confirmed, or discovered, that treats  of a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common zone and to the buhardilla, included the terrace of the roof.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, achieves the 16,50 euros, although the students, the jubilados and the headlines of the tourist cards obtain 20% of discount.
The amount surpasses considerably the price of the entrance of other constructions of Gaudí in the city.
If it wants to enjoy of the true environment of the bed with his towers of lizard, would have to do fellow quickly of some resident of the neighbouring houses and visit him home.
How it chooses  the mattress and the somier: the women and the men look for different things
At all of a frame pomposo for the bed; what really confers his quality to a good bed is the surface for tumbarse, that is to say, the mattress and the somier.
First of all they have to complement to perfection so that they adapt  to the concrete users.
During the election go in at stake numerous elements, including the weight, height, been of health and sex of the owner.
Also it results important the type of interior in which it situates  the mattress and the somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a cabin of weekend that does not be used to to have heating, do not have to use mattresses of látex because they heat "" more slowly.
Besides, they are used to to weigh considerably more than the mattresses of poliuretano usual.
Therefore, it results necessary to give them the turn more frequently.
If they do not air  properly the channels of the centre and, by on, find  on a firm base, keep inside the humidity. Even it can appear mold below.
To the hour to choose a bed, also influence the habits.
The one who have happened long abroad, often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems to feel  well in a lower surface and hard.
"Almost all the players of hockey that went back of the NHL complained that here they did not sleep the same of well".
"For his hammered shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelástica."
"This type of mattresses recommend  also for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, by what receive badly the information of the articulations and of the skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, that specialises  in the furniture padded.
A lot of players of hockey, to the equal that other clients, carry time preferring the mattresses of viscoelástica.
"Today no longer there is problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech mark Tropico."
No longer it is necessary to be a player of the NHL to be able to appreciate the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" works of a very simple way.
It optimises his rigidity and form in function of the heat absorbed or adapts  to his corporal heat.
At all it exerts pressure; during the night, will not give gone back as after a hard party.
Simply, it sleeps  better.
The viscoelástica also works like protection against the sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to his height the length of his feet, that is to say, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person would have to be, in a double room, of 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of the individual rooms, for example of solteros, recommends  like minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit also was comfortable.
"If no, can apply  a simple norm to calculate the width: to the tumbarse mouth up, would have to have the comfortably shrunk hands to the elbows", advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert of Cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, that already carries a lot of years occupying of the problematic of the healthy dream and of the ergonomics of the furniture, subject that teachs in the skilled schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs his own somier and mattress, so during the purchase it is necessary to loan attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
In contrary case, will be necessary to mount the somieres to different heights, which no always is possible in all the beds.
The mattresses of foam would have to have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with interior of docks a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimetre are for the layer that adapts  to the forms and softens.
"When touching it with the hand or when accommodating  in the mattress, definitely would not have to notice the docks", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a type of somier determinate.
The entirely padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and the base are as siamese, do not have felt in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe bad and can not  wash his found, which today does  often.
And, since every night transpiramos between 0,2 and 0,75 l of sweat, is clear that after some five or seven years the mattress will begin to remember us to a big (and congestionado) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists refuse the slogans that speak of a life of the mattress of until 25 years or, even, of a guarantee for life.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the vendors give a council: in the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, occupy carefully of the cleaning and of the wash of founds it, but better add a protective of mattress that can withdraw  and wash easily.
Although at present they manufacture  you melt of mattresses with closing of zip in all his perimeter, by what when opening them remain  in two parts (something very important for the wash and the size of the washing machine!), his manipulation in the models of main size (and by an alone person) when raising the mattress can seem one litigates between a weight fly and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somier, has a firm table?
Never!
As a lot for the beds thought so that they happen a night the visits.
However, it has to do (if you do not have them already) orifices of ventilation in the table and has to use with a mattress with docks in the interior and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in stock exchanges (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
The mattresses of poliuretano do not have to use on such bases.
For the somieres of plates no articulables and that contain between 14 and 18 plates, can use  mattresses of látex or mattresses sándwich (for example, a combination of látex and fibre of coconut), although it always is better a somier with a main number of plates, 28 or more, in which the plates of the lumbar zone are reinforced and can regulate  his rigidity.
The somieres of plates articulables do not have to use with a mattress of docks, since it does not react to the reclinación.
In addition to the adjust of the rigidity of the plates, can use  also the protection of shoulders.
It treats  of a special fixation of the plates that allows presionar or, even, bend the plates of such way that "surround" perfectly to the shoulders during the dream.
For the men that have some very wide shoulders, treats  of something very important.
Even they agree  of them the manufacturers of mattresses that, in the "masculine "", began to use a softer zone precisely around the shoulders.
Also they agree  of the women, for which put a softer zone around the hips.
For the most demanding clients, exist somieres with structure in cross or of tablillas with the call amortiguación multitorsión.
The pressure distributes  between different points and recesses  the tension.
It has to take into account also that, although it use the mattress and somier suitable, if it employs a bad almohada (big and "mullida"), will disappear the majority of the advantages.
The basic norm is simple: the almohada has to sustain the head and the corners only can arrive until the shoulders, so that they can relax  the muscles of the same.
The suitable size recommended is of 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
To the tumbarse sideways, the almohada has to be to the same level (when it combines  with the somier with reinforcement for shoulders or the softest zone of the mattress) that the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something that see, seemingly, with the original mattresses fillings of straw.
The manufacturers follow using, increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, mixes.
In fact, they are fashionable the biological mattresses.
The prime matters to base of oil, with which manufactures  the foam of poliuretano, fill up with natural oils, for example of ricino or soya.
In fact, practically all the manufacturers known employ soya.
"Biological, in the case of the mattresses, wants to say that the centre is manufactured only of materials of natural origin", explains Petr Goesšíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Likewise, they use  natural substances during the manufacture of founds it of the mattresses, one of the first aloe edge.
But also it can  opt by the microcápsulas, that free a cool aroma to forest or lavender.
They exist likewise differences for men and women.
Whereas the men freshen "" with vegetal extracts of breeze, so that it founds it of the mattress absorb the heat and freshen the body, the women prefer "to heat" founds it.
The extract of red pepper improves the circulation of the blood, so that the women feel more calidez.
The favourites at present?
The mattresses manufactured of cold foam, that are more porous, with a structure of cells adapted, which does that they are more permeable that the ones of poliuretano normal and offer more permeabilidad.
The combination of diverse rigidities of cold foam and viscoelástica allow to manufacture mattresses of diverse zones that know perfectly where goes the head, the shoulders and the heels.
A mattress of good quality will cost him of seven thousand crowns for up.
Those that exert a therapeutic function are used to to have an inferior VAT, since they consider  like sanitary means.
The first that obtained this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It results complicated to save in the mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes they can  approve the offers of the manufacturers or vendors, that in occasions offer two mattresses by the price of one.
For example, the mark Magniflex offers mattresses Duofreeze with a foam with memory Memory adhered to founds it by 11.990 crowns.
The second achieves  gratuitamente.
The era of the viscoelástica with an open cellular structure and a big density initiated  with the cosmic "material" of Tempur.
Initially it arose like material for the NASA, because during the despegues praise astronauts saw  subjected to an enormous sobrecarga.
Tempur Softens  with the heat and toughens  with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and adapts óptimamente his pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid that they produce  sores, although also to improve the comfort during the dream.
The foam viscoelástica no only uses  in the mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for almohadas that place  under the legs and relieve them, as well as his circulation.
The national manufacturers, for example, use the foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
Increasingly parents employ devices of follow-up of people to control to his children
The fear by the children carries every time to more people to think in controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially thought for the follow-up of vehicles, also can follow the movement of the people and contribute like this, for example, in case like the disappearance of the girl of nine years Anička Janatková.
By the moment the device has the approximate size of a box of cerillas, but soon will reduce  to the size of a clock.
To a lot of people gave him fear the case of the missing Anička and began  to inform on the available means to protect better to his children.
Even by the expense of invading his privacy.
"All try to say us that it does not treat  to spy, but of another half to diminish the possibilities that it produce  a tragedy", considers Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of devices of follow-up in the Czech market.
"I recognise that, in determinate cases, can abuse  of such devices, for example if they put  in the bag of somebody without his knowledge, but still do not have us topado with such cases".
"The majority of the clients really buy it by reasons of security", adds Pilin.
In his opinion, the boys always would have to know for what serves the "cajita" and how uses  in case of emergency.
The childish psychologist Dana Bočková warns on the fact that, if the boy does not want to carry it, simply will throw it.
"Even the smallest boys show big creativity to the hour to lose deliberately determinate things if they want to avoid that they control them".
"Before, the parents trusted enormously in the mobiles, but these could turn off so easily like the device of follow-up", affirms Bočková.
In his opinion, results debatable if in case of attack such device is really useful.
"If it treats  of a ready kidnapping, the author practically always will check if the boy carries some type of electronic device that can desvelar his location".
"Now it is the telephone".
"As it go  extending the use of the devices of follow-up, also will look for them, since his sale definitely will realise  with a lot of advertising"..
"In such cases, the criminals always go a go past of the police", says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an attack improvised of a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, that offers services of follow-up so much for vehicles as for people, even in case that, after an attack, destroy  immediately the device of follow-up, his presence can serve of help.
"Can configure  the device so that it send regularly the position after a determinate period".
"If it suffers damages, at least will facilitate the last position of the person in question".
"The most expensive devices carry integrated a measurer of inclination, by what if the person simply slips  and remains  motionless, the device will issue immediately a warning with the position in question", affirms Čech.
In his opinion, a service of this type can obtain even with the intelligent mobile telephones with navigation, in which only it has to install a special software.
The problem of the units of current follow-up is that by the moment treats  of devices with a similar size to a box of cerillas or the mobile telephones of lower size.
Therefore, they can lose.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, by this reason are realising  proofs at present with devices that seem a digital clock.
"Besides, they will have the advantage added that a possible aggressor perhaps do not identify the device".
"Or that identify it after some time, which can do that the police win time", adds.
Although the devices of follow-up carry  in the doll or hanging, will follow using the same technology that employs  for the follow-up of vehicles.
It treats  of the comprobación of the position with a system GPS (that it uses  in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile telephone that communicates the current position.
The army has sufficient fuses as to surround all Chequia. But only they last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of fuse for prender explosive.
Already the year happened the Ministry of Defence added to his arsenal 224 kilometres of fuse.
Therefore, they have existences for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the fuse is of two years, four at most.
The army bought the fuse for explosives to the STV Group, to. s. By forty million crowns.
The personnel of the General answered to MF DNES justifying the purchase of a so enormous quantity of fuse saying that the soldiers need for the manoeuvres of training 60 kilometres of fuse to the year.
According to the calculations of the pirotécnicos of the army, with which put  in contact MF DNES, decides  however that, in such a case, would have to realise said manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives every year also all the generals, official of high control, and even secretaries and cleansing.
They did not want to exentos neither the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
Only like this it could  justify that the army spend sixty kilometres of fuse.
Such length equivale to 25.000 explosions.
Although like this it was, the army would have sufficient existences for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, such as they say the experts, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two metres of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient existences for the 225 indicated previously.
The soldiers of the brigade of fast intervention complained personally does little in front of the Minister Vondra because they say that hardly they have ammunition for diverse arms, by what limit  even the practices of shot by question of money.
And we do not speak on the fault of underwear.
"I neither attain to comprise that they buy us repeatedly such quantities of fuse."
"But it is his decision and, definitely, will know why act like this".
"For us, the army is a good client to the that, like company, try to satisfy", admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the centenas of kilometres of fuse saying also that will have existences of this "ammunition" like minimum for ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of STV Group, indicates that the fuse so only has an useful life of four years and, in the case of the products pirotécnicos for the army or the police, of two years.
"If it stores  in some perfect conditions, can last until four", says one of the soldiers that, by the possible critics of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the ending of his useful life, each ammunition has to check carefully to see if it keeps on being reliable and will not prejudice to the soldiers.
But these proofs are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometres of fuse, obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than the request of the year happened of 244 kilometres", indicates the spokesman Pejšek of the centre of shopping of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of fuse of the pirotécnicos of the police, that delete the ammunition of the Second World War or the left by the Soviet army, does not surpass already from does years the 1.500 metres.
Besides, the police always asks only the just quantity as to exhaust the ammunition before it finish  his useful life.
They decided it by reasons of security for the pirotécnicos and, besides, in the meantime can  achieve types of fuse more modern and reliable.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties to finish tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition of the period of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred one thousand people prepared  for a campaign in the Rin.
According to the pirotécnicos with which spoke MF DNES, after a pair of years will produce  the following problem with the current: it will be necessary to delete cientos of kilometres of old fuse, that is buying  now cheap "".
Up to now I follow living of the contacts that achieved thanks to the contest
The fact to win the contest "Employer of the year" helped to Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchises of his hotel.
The the last edition, won the contest "Employer of the year" the emprendedor of 28 years Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His history of success seems taken out of a film.
To Lukáš Pytloun loved him travel.
Abroad it gave  account that in Liberec did lacking accommodation of quality at good cost.
With the savings that gathered with seasonal works abroad and a credit of the bank bought a house that was half derruida composed of five flats.
Taking into account that it still studied his third year in the university, was really brave.
"In the actuality, the relation quality-price of the accommodation in our zone promoted me to do something in this regard", says Lukáš Pytloun.
It began to rent the first flat reconstructed to foreign workers.
All the income that obtained invested them again in the building, that gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since, in seven years in the business, achieved little by little open in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all the categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, till lately, the hotel of design of four stars Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another of the same quality.
"We finish to sign an agreement with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to the that have sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest by a franchise of Pytloun", said the employer number one of the past year.
"To this sale of licences for the opening of hotels helped to a large extent the fact to win the contest of the 'Employer of the year'", adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity so much in Liberec as in the surroundings.
"The people recognised me by the street, still congratulated me often and, have to say, that was very pleasant", remembers.
Definitely, it recommends to all the world that want to try some company that participate in the contest.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but the participation already is beneficial.
It affirms that, until the moment, follows living of the contacts and known that, without the contest, perhaps had not obtained.
"With some people that knew thanks to the contest have begun to collaborate usually."
The fame associated to the success, in his opinion, included likewise in the employees,
in total around seventy.
"I have seen that show a main loyalty and are proud to participate in something that obtained the general recognition".
"It is not, neither much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of all the team."
"Only that it is my name the one who appears in first flat", says today modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
To my successor wish him a calmer year of the that have had in Farmet
The euphoria by the victory soon dissipated  by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the victorious, is possible that Farmet already have been over the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the contest of Vodafone "Company of the year", the year happened in the "Slavic House" of Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which attained to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice in a signature with a volume of businesses of centenas of millions.
"I can say that the prize no only encouraged me to me, but to all my collaborators and improved our confidence to struggle against the competition", says the winner of the past year.
The history of the company Farmet begins with the wish to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žďárský the rent of a small workshop like compensation by the embargo of properties during the communism, did not doubt too much; it renounced to his place in the company in that worked and, with a pair of mates, founded the company with his father of batteries of plastic.
Shortly after, they began to specialise  in press of vegetal oil.
Eight years afterwards turned into the main manufacturer of automatic press of the centre of Europe.
They obtained an elder witnesses also between the no specialised public after achieving the success in the contest in the media.
"No only our clients began to consider to the mark Farmet as considerably better, but also the foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that obtained a main success in his country", says Karel Žďárský.
The year happened perhaps did not go in Farmet only a sample of the euphoria of the victory.
It obtained likewise recognition by the commercial results until the year 2008 and, partially, of the 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The impairment of the crisis, that still had not achieved to so many citizens, caused that the companies detained his projects of investment and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, obviously, neither rid us of such situation".
"The income reduced  in 40%, had to limit the production and even had some dismissals", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company has to, in occasions, adopt even measured little popular.
Nevertheless, they controlled the situation and kept the gains of the company, although it was to inferior levels that before the crisis.
In spite of everything, in where Farmet no recortó expenses was in the investigation and development.
"With the subsidies have built a centre of investigation and training, reinforce the presence in the international market and obtained glorious assessments in national fairs", says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they already have left the crisis behind.
The income go back to increase and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new attainment expect that it contribute a feeling of victory, but in a more calmed atmosphere", signals Karel Žďárský.
A survey that desvela the ridiculous norms
The survey of Absurdez of the year forms part by fourth time of the business tournament.
Already it has attained to delete some ridiculous norms.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey Absurdez of the year was the obligation to carry to the administration documents to which the civil servants can access on line.
The decision adopted it more than a third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of the social security asked an extract of the mercantile register, although his civil servants can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of the social security no longer will ask an extract of the mercantile register when it realise a control of the imposiciones of the ensured", declared the spokesman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the survey Absurdez of the year consists in consulting the norms and regulation that have to respect the companies and employers in Chequia and try that they delete  those that are absurd.
This year it forms by fourth time splits of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create fans likewise between the general public.
Whereas the edition of the past year had the participation of three thousand voters, this year practically achieved the four thousand.
And it does not result surprising, since we still have legal obligations several spare that have to respect simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of necessary papers for the statement of taxes are in the first place world-wide", comments Karel Havlíček of the Association of small and medium enterprises and of employers of the Czech Republic.
From it does years, the simplification of the business norms is an aim declared of all the governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, Chequia situates  in the position 74ª, that is to say, eight worse places that the past year.
The contest Absurdez of the year celebrated  for the first time in 2006 and every year repeats  of the same way.
Any one can indicate some absurdez administrative or bureaucratic every year between April and finals of September, when it closes  the contest.
The proposals can realise  in the page web www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organiser of the contest chooses to seven candidates for the "antipremio" and, during October, allows that the public vote in Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdez that receives more votes.
For the survey of this year presented  more than one hundred, in particular 105 norms and regulations that do not have felt.
The examples sent them so much employers like professional associations and journalists.
Between the "finalists" of the contest situated , for example, the requirement that the vehicles for the maintenance of the roads and highways pay the toll or that the employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint each two years the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published in the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, that always realises  to starts of November in the square of Wenceslao of Prague, forms part of an event in which they are used to to participate personalities of the political and social world.
This year, for example, they assisted to this act of the contest Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium enterprises and of employers of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužthe, president of the Camera of Trade of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity can not keep if the State puts him continuously fetters to the employers, thus my aim consists in in deleting every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that at present complicate unnecessarily the trade", announced the Minister of industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The efforts for deleting the absurd regulations do not remain  in water of borrajas.
In the year 2007, what more bothered to the people was the obligation of the employer to communicate with a antelación of three days to the business office of the zone of permanent operation, the intention to attend with a place to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation deleted  in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, that is to say, the communication to the office of work by part of his foreign workers of the trips of work of until 30 days, deleted  in the law of the called green card.
And third time lucky.
The Absurdez of the year 2009 was the regulation for the fisioterapeutas to have in his query a big mirror, a fridge and two scales of soil.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had deleted the obligation to have of a fridge.
A new category recognises to the responsible companies socially
Value  the ecological projects, humanitarian, educational or sportive.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodářské noviny is the category called responsible Company of the year 2010.
The committed of this contest consists in backing to the responsible and just companies.

For this new subcategoría special of the edition of this year of the main contest of Vodafone Company of the year 2010 presented  companies for which the commercial success is not the only aim on a long-term basis.
The history of each one of them results inspiradora and would allow us write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies entirely between one and another, the common denominator is the support and the consideration that offer.
In a case, treats  for example of the disabled people, in others of the personal problems or of health of the employees.
Between the fourteen finalists of all the Republic situated , for example, the company praguense of software Et Netera, that backs the training of informal sportive teams between his workers, that afterwards participate in tournaments of diverse sports.
Another example of responsible company of the zone of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Bravo, that already carries seven years being the main aportador of bottoms to sponsor to the disabled boys.
In Poděbrad, there is a papelería that concerns  especially of the problems of health of his workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; therefore it received the title of responsible Company of the central zone of Chequia and in the contest Vodafone Company of the year finished in third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the company of accounting MiRyz Soft, that reduced the labour schedule, even underneath of the average of 35 weekly hours, without reducing the wages.
The title also awarded it to him because it buys prioritariamente to Czech manufacturers, backs the activities comunitarias in the zone and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle the maximum possible so that our activities of production and administration produce the lower possible impact in the environment", explains the employer Milušand Ryznarová.
The responsible company of YOU Enlogit of the region of Ústí also thinks in the health of his employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; besides, it backs the work from house and in his business events uses the services of catering of a company protected local.
"Besides, we back the scholarship Person in difficulties, that helps in concrete to the community romaní venue", comments the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
Also they situate  in good place with a quotation the company of lavandería Praní to čištění of the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive bonuses of a special way that repercuten in his pension funds.
"We give profits in food, transport, improvement of the qualifications and leisure", says Josef Strapáč, of the company of construction of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the region of Moravia-Silesia.
In the category of responsible Company of the year designated  automatically to all the regional finalists of the contest Vodafone Company of the year that answered to the questions of the form of registration and sent it before 15 August to the organisers.
The organisers deleted of the evaluation the forms that were not complete or erroneous.
"If the representatives of the companies concursantes did not answer the questions, could not participate in the contest of responsible Company of the year, but do not remain disqualified of the main "contest" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual candidatures for this contest are not allowed, since it treats  of a subcategoría of the main contest of Company of the year", explains Karel Goldman of the consultancy Bison & Rose.
The police realised arrests during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Bottom, in Pilsen
The police against the corruption realised diverse arrests in the building of the Agricultural Bottom in the last days.
The detectives manacled to a local employer of the sector of the means and to the employer inmobiliario Luboš G.
Seemingly, this try to manipulate a public auction in course for the restitution of the rights of such way that the terrain auctioned received it an interested precise.
It had to pay him thus to Luboš G. Half million of crowns.
"By the so alone moment can say that the police looks for to a person by bribe during a public auction and public bidding", said to Právo the boss of the general public prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that by the moment can not spread more details on the investigation in course.
After twenty-four hours, the police soltó to the employer of 46 years.
On the way in that it could influence in the public auction, given the little official information, so only can  especular.
The spokesman of the Agricultural Bottom Lubomíra Černá answered to the questions of Právo saying that the police carried out really the arrest in the headquarters of Pilsen and went during a public auction.
"It treats  of a client, no of one of our workers", required.
According to Černá, the public auction calls  "Announcement for the presentation of proposals of transfer of terrains of compliance with the law on the earth" and realises  when they appear several parts interested in relation with the terrain offered.
"These people, during the announcement, offer an upper value to the of his restitution, that has to be transferred before it announce  the value of the terrain."
"In function of the offers, determines  the order of the buyers and, afterwards, the Agricultural Bottom transfers the terrain to the person that offer the main offer" explained the spokesman of the Bottom.
Luboš G. It had information on who went  to present to the announcement and, since at the same time it is person interested because it purchased diverse rights of restitution, proposed to the interested in the terrain that would not participate in the auction.
By such favour, was earning a commission.
This would explain that, in the moment of the arrest, had so much money on.
Luboš G. It had special contacts at the bottom of Pilsen already from does time.
It appeared in the cause of the ancient boss of the PF Václav Sankot, that was accused for dismissing the replacement of terrains for which already had issued  a decision of construction.
For example, Luboš G. It finishes to obtain of the Bottom some planned terrains for the construction of public infrastructures, in particular in the place where would have to build  a big road to the industrial zone of Borská pole.
Afterwards, it changed them of form very beneficial with the magistrate by a house in the own historical centre of the city with a very upper value.
In this case, the city council had to take part because, in contrary case, the terrains blocked would avoid the construction.
The families will have to pay some additional expenses of several centenas of crowns to the month
The homes will have to pay from January no only by all the types of energy, but also by water and electricity, complementos by heating and, in some cases, main rents.
Therefore, the families will have to take out of the wallet, from January, several hundreds of crowns to the month more than now.
The price of the electricity increases in 4,6%, the gas around 2%, in some cities will have to pay until 10% more by the supply of water and many increase also the price of the central heating.
The rise of the electricity for the families that live in apartments would have to rise to some 100 crowns more to the year that now.
However, the main providers of electricity reduced the prices, due to the fact that it has increasing the support to the production of energy of renewable sources, in particular the photovoltaic.
However, the gas puts up the price of  moderately, especially in the moment in that more uses  the heating and, therefore, main is the consumption.
In this case, also they have to have a pair of centenas of crowns more to the year.
Whereas the electricity and the gas put up the price of  by all the country, the change of price of the central heating varies of a place to another.
The rise of prices schedules it mainly the main municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or of Hradec Králové will pay from January by the central heating some 50 crowns more to the month, whereas the families of Liberec will pay more than 1.000 additional crowns to the year.
The residents in Prague also will have to bear an increase of 9% of the price of the water and the heating, especially in case that the city increase the rent of the infrastructures.
If the rent does not vary, the praguenses will pay 6,8% additional.
The prices in Prague, however, will follow being between the more basses of all the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where the current prices are between the highest, both taxes will put up the price of  7,4%.
They can increase considerably the prices of the rent of 450.000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will finalise in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, that possesses in Ústí nad Labem around 2.500 flats, will increase the rent from January in until 100%.
The company will carry to the courts to those who do not agree with the new rent.
The rents regulated, that benefit to the residents of around 300.000 flats, could increase next year until 10%.
The Czech youngsters  emborrachan with Fernet and rum. The beer no longer is of way, because it does effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even whiskeys good stolen to his parents.
Those are the drinks that cause that they finish in young medical cares bebedores with an inferior age to fifteen years.
The boys that finish tumbados in the hospital continuously to surpass the hangover no longer are an exception.
This derives  of the experience of the doctors that find  with such cases in the admissions of pediatrics of the hospital.
"Drink beer or came no longer is fashionable, because they take a lot in emborracharles."
"Now the fashion are the strong alcoholic drinks", indicates to Právo the boss of pediatrics of the Hospital Hořovice in the centre of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they attain to take him a bottle to his father of the alacena, can be whisky, but usually treats  of Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it lightens  with juice and that it does not smell so much", explains.
It confirms it also the spokesman of the university Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Usually, it is used to to treat of Fernet or rum."
"Those are the modern alcoholic drinks, in particular between the pupils."
"In some cases, use aguardiente that took home", adds Jurinová.
According to the boss Pelikán, are bebedores of thirteen and fourteen years those that are used to appear in the hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where works from this year, worked during a decenio in the pediatrics in Motol, to where the ambulances carried to the youngsters from the near zones.
"A girl had to ingresar perhaps four times."
"It began to the twelve years, when they brought it with 3,5 of alcohol in blood, in addition to a mix with ecstasy", indicates the doctor of the department on this case.
"It found  in the fair of Holešovice in some party of dance."
"The interesting is that to his mother neither surprised him that his daughter disappeared 48 hours", surprises  the boss.
It is precisely the fault of interest of the parents or even his clear tolerance to the drink by part of his children the one who considers  the main cause of the increase of the consumption of alcohol between the youngsters.
The experts signal that, in the case of the boys, can not  speak properly of dependency.
"It understands  by alcoholic to a person that has a chronic dependency of the alcohol from does several years, with all the phenomena associated to the same, which does not produce  in boys."
"In those that drink alcohol repeatedly, rather has to  of some social or familiar surroundings systematically fallido", explains the boss Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year in the clinical pediátrica of Motol  hospitalizaron until mediated of November forty intoxicated boys.
However, the statistics only show those that attend with a grave intoxication and have to remain in the hospital.
The youngsters bebedores that, after the medical recognition ambulante, go  home with the parents or with the police, do not explain.
In addition to the cases in that the boys simply gather  after the school and drink  aguardiente, for Pelikán exist three altibajos seasonal that fits to mention: the day of witches, End of Year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstance, drink by the bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holidays."
"In the day of the witches have arrived to see in admissions until seven intoxicated boys at the same time", adds Pelikán.
The bebedores that happen the night in detoxication under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover home.
The headache matinal, caused by the dehydration and the fault of glucose, avoids  with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that are missing him to the organism.
"These carry it much better, because after the agitated night, raise  well and does not hurt them at all."
"Only they show  garbled with regard to where are", signals Pelikán, adding that, often, the patients lose the good humour at least when they see the expenses that have generated.
The transfer in ambulance and the hospitalisation in a room for grave patients arrives to cost a ten of thousands of crowns.
"Often I have used the cost like a half to educate them, when in the visit say them directly to the boys how much has cost his drunkenness and that they would have to happen all the summer in a work for youngsters so that you won the sufficient to pay  this night", adds Pelikán.
The safe doctor, in his opinion perhaps like measure regresiva, that is used to to give him back to the people the expenses of the treatment, does not do it in the case of boys that drink.
Two aeroplanes L-159 find  for the first time in extraneous hands in Spain
Two aeroplanes L-159 of a total of five, by which the Ministry of Czech Defence substituted the aeroplane Marries C-295M, split the Tuesday for Seville, where finds  the manufacturer of the aircraft Marries - EADS.
It is the first time that a device of this type finds  in hands of somebody that was not the Czech army.
By the moment, only were abroad to realise flights of practices or of demonstration.
It treats  of the version biplaza L-159T1, that until the moment used the Czech army and that still was in state to fly.
The three remaining aeroplanes are the monoplaza L-159.
These still conserve  in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already did  charge of them the past week.
Jan Peješk, of the department of press of defence, indicates that it still does not know  when will withdraw  the aeroplanes physically of Vodochody.
"The aeroplanes monoplaza L-159, instead, were separated of the aeroplanes repaired does time, without investments neither additional contributions by part of the Ministry."
"The biplaza L-159T1 exchanged  in his current state", said to Právo Pejšek.
It added that the army does not remain  without aeroplanes biplaza, since in May of 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody an agreement by a cuantía of 200 million crowns for the construction of four devices L-159 unnecessary for biplazas.
One of the new aeroplanes already received it the army in July, the another will deliver  to finals of year.
According to Pejšek, EADS engaged  to that the aeroplanes add  to the equipment of some allied countries.
"In the agreement indicates  clearly that the company EADS is the one who withdraws the aeroplanes L-159 and that will serve for the practices of pilots of Nato countries."
"Therefore, it depends of the buyer decide how goes to use them in this frame", signals Pejšek.
The periodic Hospodářské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by an aeroplane Marries and the purchase of other three aircraft by 3.500 million crowns were approved the year gone through the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not summon a bidding for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of defence affirms that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreigner.
The Czech army purchased to Aer 72 aircraft and so only uses 24, by what wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aeroplanes Marries possibly arrive to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission already reported to the Ministry of Czech Defence in front of the Court of European Justice because it would have to choose the aeroplanes realising a European bidding and not to putting in contact with an only manufacturer.
The army already received three aeroplanes Marries and the last would have to arrive to the airport praguense of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger that the annular indicates a lower risk to suffer cancer
The men that have the longest index that the annular are subject to a lower risk to suffer cancer of prostate.
This is the surprising conclusion of a studied published the Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could they depend of the level of testosterona, the masculine hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can constitute a simple proof of the risk to suffer cancer of prostate, in particular for the men with ages of until 60 years", indicated the coautora of the study Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for the investigation on the cancer in the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help to determine which men would have to subject to a proof of cancer of prostate, in particular if this characteristic goes associated to a genetic risk or other hurtful factors, like problems of familiar health, as it indicates Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, realised the follow-up with a homologous British of more than 1.500 patients with cancer of prostate and, simultaneously, of 3.000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the finger índica of the right hand shorter that the annular.
They presented the same probabilities to suffer cancer of prostate that 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of the men with a longer index that the ring finger, this risk reduced  in 33%; for the men with inferior ages to 60% the reduction achieved 87%.
The relation between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the period prenatal, reflects different levels of hormones to which is exposed the foetus in the matrix.
A level of testosterona inferior corresponds  with a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that the testosterona influences in the development of the cancer of prostate.
The big genetista Czech and ancient president of the Academy of Sciences, the professor Václav Pačis, said to ČTK that knows the study, but that does not seem him that the relation between the length of the fingers and the cancer can show " entirely".
The Czech Republic under snow: they are closed the D1 and the D5
Chequia, to the equal that the majority of Europe, dawned the Thursday covered of snow.
The roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by compact snow and the machines quitanieve circulated all night by numerous zones.
In the morning it was closed the road D5 between the kilometres 89 and 93 in direction to Rozvadov because of several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourisms, to the equal that the D1 in Brno in direction to Prague.
The news transmitted them the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In the kilometre 91 damaged  a truck, in the 93 bumped two industrial vehicles that caused injured.
Also several tourisms finished in the cuneta.
They exist likewise problems in the autovía D1 in the kilometre 185 in direction to Prague.
There they bumped two trucks.
The drivers have to circulate slowly after Brno in the kilometre 190 or cross Brno and incorporate in the kilometre 182 in Kývalce.
There they have formed  atascos of several kilometres.
Also it has produced  an accident in the road D11, just beside Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimetres and the thermometers indicate -7 ºC.
they are forming  atascos For example in Prosek, although it also is congestionada Štěrboholská.
The half of transport safer is the metre.
The trams circulate with delay, for example in the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
To the eight of the morning, will produce  another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems affect likewise to the railways and to the airport.
Owing to the snow, the company of Czech railways had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, to the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
The travellers would have to check which is the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně closed  from the eleven of the night of the Wednesday until the five of the morning.
At present, already it can  circulate by the majority of the south roads of Moravia, but with extreme precaución.
In Vyškovska are closed to the circulation three secondary roads, in Brněnska are forming  tongues of snow and in Blanenska need  chains to access to determinate roads of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Until the moment are closed the connections: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them will require  fresadoras.
By the moment can not  say when will open  to the circulation.
In Hodonínska, requires  cautela in the zone of the Bílé Karpaty (Cárpatos white).
The roads of the region that, since it treats  of a natural zone protected, owe simply leave in inert state, accumulate  until five centimetres of snow, as it indicates ČTK.
In Chequia fell between two and ten centimetres of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the layer of snow achieves the 18 centimetres.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, fell around 15 centimetres of snow.
The snowfalls remit gradually in Chequia.
The American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is employing in Afghanistan a new intelligent "weapon", known by the moment only by the name encoded XM-25.
The generals expect that the new rifle influence in the local conflict with the Talibans and that "change the progress of the game" did his victory.
The new arms are like a small gun and with a puntería extremely precise.
His bullets shoot  with a laser with a precision of several metres.
The special ammunition of calibrate of 25 mm created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains causes that in reality it work like a small pomegranate.
The projectiles can program  so that they explode no only when they strike to the aim, but in any point that find  in his ballistic path.
Can use  against the enemies that hide  after an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Definitely, it can not  use a normal protection and, when it launches his rain murders of astillas metallic, can result essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, that spoke on the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry that uses an intelligent "technology".
"The soldiers manipulate it of such way that find the aim, aim to the same his ray laser, that determines the distance, afterwards obtains a precise sight and, in function of the same, corrects the line of projection and tightens the trigger."
"We say that they have measured  543 metres."
"When it presses  the trigger, the weapon loads  and launches the projectile to a distance of 543 metres, more less one, two or three metres", signals Audette.
They move  400 places of work
The consortium Fujitsu moves his branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change his place of work of his previous building of offices in the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves his branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As it communicated the giant of the skilled sector in computers and his maintenance the Wednesday, 400 men and women will move  in July of the following year of his previous building of offices in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park, a big complex of offices in the street Lyoner Straßand in the neighbourhood of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A spokesman of Fujitsu explained that to half term other 100 employees more than the consortium, that previously found  disseminated by the region, will lodge  there.
The offer is highly attractive, besides the collective office in Star Park will favour the way to work of the employees.
Besides, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner affirmed, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad have found a emplazamiento central with an excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important in the actuality for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new mudanza of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy between which were in favour and disappointment between which were against.
The boss of section of economy of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU) affirmed that with this has won  a "Global " Player".
This is a "glorious recognition to the emplazamiento".
Fujitsu Assent  in the city, the settlement is a big impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The greens) regrets  of the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction informed before to the city on his intention.
"Of course we have offered to the company our help", declared Korwisi.
However, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons producieron the fall.
In such a way, now there is a big empty place that cover in the famous place.
"I expect that the owner and the arrendador of the building show  cooperative."
The inmueble previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbour "Kleine Vertikale" formed part with the excess buildings of Marienbader Platz from ten years ago of a controversial project of construction of the city spa.
Like conjoint project of the city and of a private company of projects between the station and the city council forms  a new entrance to the city, that commissions  of the critic regarding the edificación massive that previously used the gaps like squares of parking and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001 they have installed  the council of investment and companies of valuation, the manufacturer of Software for systems of reservations, Start Amadeus, as well as then it joined Siemens with marries it manufacturer of computers Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was purchased by the group inmobiliario of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Are and a year later revendido to the Spanish Falcon Real Are Investments SA in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, oriundo of Tokyo, recognises  like the third main world-wide provider of YOU.
It has of companies, for example of computers and servers, and loans also the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the main in Germany, of all ways Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions installs  from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
Therefore they have rented  7.000 square metres in the building of offices of Star Park.
The ancient complex of the years twenty, his name alludes to his plane with form of star, houses amongst other to the central association of electrotécnica and to the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
The anxiety  apodera increasingly of Wikileaks.
The provider of services of internet Amazon has deleted the platform of disclosures of his server.
Possibly behind it find  political pressure after the publication of cientos of thousands of diplomatic documents secrets.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, when seeming is detained in England.
The platform of disclosures of Wikileaks is always the white of the critics, always stronger in the United States.
The activists of internet lost the access to his previous American server and at present look for a homeland of internet in Europe.
The known American senator, Joe Lieberman, flame to other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, that finds  in the list of people looked for of Interpol, has to remain arrested person in Great Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks Expelled of the server of Amazon."
"Speak freely in the country of the freedom", communicated the activists of the disclosures by means of the service of mail Twitter the Wednesday (local hour).
Shortly before, the company of internet, Amazon, had deleted the documents of Wikileaks of his server.
The activists of internet had resorted in the publication of diplomatic documents secrets to the web of services Amazon to be able to face up to the high figures of access to the documents.
By means of Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfecto, will allocate our dollars to hire to people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with the freedom of expression, "would have to leave to sell books".
Amazon detained the use of his server by means of Wikileaks, after an employee of the senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, informed the chain CNN according to a call to the office of Lieberman.
The presidency of the council of the senate for the security of the country had loomed to Amazon with boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"It had wished that Amazon took these measures before, before the previous publications of information classified by means of Wikileaks", declared the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also forbade in other countries the use of the server.
"The illegal process, monstrous and inconsiderate of Wikileaks puts at stake our national security and looms the life in the world", affirmed  in a communiqué of the independent senator.
"Any responsible company, already was American or foreign, has to help to Wikileaks with his service to extend material stolen.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, that is looked for in Sweden by suspicion of rape, finds  in the list of people looked for of Interpol.
According to an article of the newspaper londinense "The Independent", the Australian of 39 years finds  detained in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The activist of internet has described constantly the investigation in Sweden like a plot of his enemy.
The spokesman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, affirmed in London that have existed threats.
"There was even called on a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore it fears  by the security of Assange, affirmed Hrafnsson.
Therefore, it follows without revealing  the location of the founder of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson Reacted obviously in front of the statements of North America.
In America, the previous republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, affirmed that the manager of the disclosures of Wikileaks has to be judged by betrayal and has to be executed.
In Canada, affirmed an adviser of the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in the television, Assange would have to "be murdered" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange grows a big dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of the American president Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange have asked the resignation of the secretary of state, in case that she was responsible to order recently to diplomatic that  involucrasen in tasks of espionage.
"I am not of the all safe why has to matter us the opinion of a type with a page web", declared Gibbs.
"Our external politics and the interests of this country are much stronger that his page web."
The American government has to show the efficiency of the protection of his databases of general way.
Russell Travers, director attach of distribution of the National Centre against the terrorism, was appointed exceptional attendant, announced the White House.
By what Travers is responsible to develop "the important structural reforms", that are necessary to the light of the leak of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to inspect the ways, as well as change the total information on the government and protect it.
Besides, the American government announced that to commission  of the security of the dissident and activists, have to put in danger the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done all the possible to put us in contact with them", affirmed the spokesman of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help to protect them if it was necessary."
The university of the ice cream
In the "Gelato University" in Bolonia prepare  heladeros in the best periods of the year.
The basic course of three days for futures heladeros has the maximum influx and visitors of all the world.
In reality of where it comes all the ice cream?
Of the gelatiere and of the gelataio.
The gelatiere elaborates the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the preparation of ice creams.
The gelataio takes out with a espátula the cream of the ice cream of the mostrador, elaborates on it the barquillo and sells it.
To know this, does not do lacking to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bolonia.
But the one who want to know more on ice creams, would not have to visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has instrumented to the university of the ice cream with the congeladora in the year 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of his machines fulfil the ideal heights Italians everywhere.
The basic course of three days for futures heladeros has the maximum influx and visitors of all the world.
Also there are more special courses of more days on the ice cream of chocolate and practical in the ice cream parlour of the own house.
In these times of crisis, some dream with a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream his vagos wishes.
This time are 40 participants of 19 countries of all the continents, from Brazil until Saudi Arabia going through Hungary.
To Jacky, professor of this art of California, loves him the slow movement of the food and in the future wants to offer a European product of quality in the earth of the industrial ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is aide of companies and wants to create something own in some years inside a work enervante.
Two Egyptian youngsters dream with opening an ice cream parlour in the Cairo.
A man of Malta and another of Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams of his bars, and a master of Canadian house, Julia, comes because to his children love them the Italian ice creams.
The master heladero Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not decisive alone his good taste, but also his softness sedosa and his good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training neither the cover of born of the national upper house and mainly south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and therefore each ball has something romantic."
The first step to the preparation seems facilísimo.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, born, milk in dust, sugar and stabilizers in a big batidora, that heats everything with an electronic program until 85 degrees and to the moment cools it until four degrees.
Afterwards it opens the tap of the machine and goes out a white basic cream pasteurised, the base for all the types of ice creams of milk.
Suddenly, the professor asks: The cream of ice cream can elaborate only with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How can give  loose rein to some win to experience?
Luciano advises that  despisten of the tendencies of the period.
The one who speaks of ice cream "no only of natural ingredients", probably has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably rubber guar, of bean guar.
Of course that it can elaborate  ice cream without stabilizer, only is necessary to buy it a day, place it in a stock exchange and the client will bite an audible ice cream of granite.
They allow  some variations in the basic mass.
They employ  aromas.
Regarding the taste of the ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients those that buy  in the section of fruit or in the one of sweet of the supermarket.
Ademas, there are dusts and pastes.
"All the providers will try colar ingredients aromatizados in his commodity."
"However they have to experience some time."
Already it was with sherbets of fruit with sugar and cool fruits.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of the white basic mass, that with eggs will go back  a yellow cream and with cacao in dust like base for all the possible pleasures of the chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the heladoras.
Luciano leaves them elaborate every time four distinct types of ice cream of vainilla, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vainilla or other natural ingredients.
They realise the same experiment also with types of ice cream of fruit.
That it know better does not depend necessarily that it have more aroma of tofe or more purée of fruits.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of hazelnuts know to nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The group of work elaborates the adored ice cream of kiwi, that uses more fruits, less water and something less than stabilizer.
First a mix balanced resalta the flavour of the ice cream, affirms Luciano.
The preparation of ice creams is a problem of artimética: it employs  the purée of peach with a lot of sugar, it is necessary to recess the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe.
For the ice cream of lemon does fault an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensilio with which fixed the quantity of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the vinicultor for Oechsle in the mosto of grape).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Elaborate ice cream does not require more than the physical application, as before.
No only it helps the utensilio for the automatic preparation of the basic mass.
Also there is a utensilio, in which it beats  simultaneously the mix of ice cream prepared and cools  to temperature under zero.
In spite of everything, all the automation remains  went regarding the small paste.
The Brazilian Gustavo marks  to himself same and to his mates of up to down with purée of fruits, as if it was a miniprimer giant without control.
"In all the courses", affirms the master Luciano, "is only a question of time that happen something like this."
Inspectors in a situation complicated
The European authority of security of the foods Efsa has infiltrated  in the industry that experiences with plants transgénicas.
At present this subject formulates it the group of experts Testbiotech, that considers  an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of the biotechnology.
"It seems a theory of conspiracy but have not documented it well", affirmed Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, the Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts of Efsa on plants genetically modified, and another expert of Efsa also are hired from does years in the association Ilsi.
The consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay it.
Kuiper Has collaborated of significant way in the norms of comprobación of Efsa of plants genetically modified, what situates him in a clear conflict of interests, criticises Then.
The disposals of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, that in reality is controlled by his Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticises a collision of interests.
Like this, it does little, a manager of high rank of Efsa was without the support neither the time of transition to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with this his edict.
It does little, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the inspection of the EU and the industry, that realised the Oficinal General of the Environment as well as a clarividente parliamentary of the EU.
Nevertheless, Efsa can not recognise any conflict of interests.
It resorts  to all the formal data, also to some of the industry, whenever they are of a high and technical quality, order  in a report.
It does not demand  to the experts that work in Efsa that do not have any contact with the industry.
But they have to expose these contacts.
Kuiper Admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in USA
designates  to himself same like a neutral forum for the experts and the science, the industry and the politics, amongst other for the evaluation of the risk for the biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
In this subject, independent experts, like Then, criticise that at present they allow  plants transgénicas without investigating the food for the animals and that do not check  the influence of the genetically modified plants in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, does the genetically modified corn in the agriculture", affirms Then.
The current practice consists in verifying unicamente proteinas isolated, but no the plant transgénica whole, which does not offer reliable results.
"If they do not look for  the risks, how go  to find?", question, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks of the same way.
The scientist investigates from 1994 the field of the genetic engineering and at present works in the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this field, the industry tries increasingly, in USA and in Europe, influenciar or discredit to the critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists that are not influenciados by consortiums.
For the companies, the critical studies do not publish  by general rule.
"The industry controls the investigation of the security", keeps Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total some 400 kilos.
The Monday was in front of the station of Stuttgart, with the Tuba to the backs.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The history is known: In September arrived the excavadoras and began to demolish a big piece of the wing north.
The earth of Stuttgart never went back to be the same: Miles and thousands manifested  against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was precintado, the main part of the wing  hizó demolitions.
Broken in 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft stone rugosa, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell Is sculptor in Ostfildern, has 43 years.
It has ensured  a pair of pieces.
"These stones are reliquias."
"They do not have to disappear."
It excites : "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As it said once, it has smelt the smoke of the cigarettes.
Still it does not know what will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell Also.
The trace of the stones of Stuttgart carries to a forest in Tubingen in a previous tank of ammunitions of the Armed French, where Manuel Rongen erigió his stone Stein-Reich.
The man of 44 years treats with ancient stones.
It has bought all what result of the demolición in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonours, would grind the gravel or would send it to the basurero", affirms in his office, a casita wooden that once was a caseta on call.
They abused him and they loomed, it explains, when, in September, appeared in the newspapers, that had bought the rests of the wing north to the company of derribos.
The spoke with the enemies of the 21S during several days.
And it explained them that it could not do absolutely at all by the demolish.
And when sucedió, then was the most reasonable, when the stones followed using.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the mazizo of 80 kilos cut, with a price by piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as I remember but also with the hope to be able to give it back in a reconstruction.
Rongen Had bought 500 tonnes, a load of 25 trucks.
Roughly the half is still in the forest, the rest does time that sold .
Owner of gardens, gardener paisajista, commissioned of projects.
They arrived from everywhere and they carried  what could carry in the maletero and on.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse does time that has turned into "the wall" or in the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In reality this stone is not at all special", affirms Rongen.
"If it did not go by the political component."
It rises to his todoterreno, does a tour by his big realm of 20 hectares.
It studied right, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interest him the computers and finally works with stones.
And it is lover of the stones.
It lodges to 4.000 tonnes of stone.
It transports his treasures by all Germany.
It says to be the elder tratante of ancient stones of the country.
It brakes.
In the snow there is artistic stones of arenisca hammered.
"Pertencieron To the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke", explains.
Limestone alba, yellow, warm, excites .
"My dear stone."
The way crosses the forest.
It signals a montón: Arenisca red, a previous piece of the station of Karlsruhe.
And it follows.
"Beautiful travertino."
In the past the mazizos belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Throughout in the snow, stones and histories, travertino yellow of the police headquarters of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, toba of the hospital of Heilbronner.
Which work, which effort, which sweat.
When Rongen thinks in as esculpió before the stones and moved them with a simple get ready and a cart, feels  very worshipper.
"It would be a scandal if something destroyed ."
It has not done  rich, at all inmensamente rich.
But today 14 people gave that do to the tratante of stones, besides canteros, a sculptor, a smith, a vidriero and a gardener have installed  up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory", affirms the man that commissions  to take advantage of the rests.
Shortly it has to go to Colony.
There also there are stones that rescue.
Fight of talents around big potentials
Reigns an active influx in the buffet.
16 students bank  around the buns, the soup of tomato and the sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of cars Vokswagen have invited to a workshop to the students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a species of contest of ideas, have to speak on the car of the future with the workers of VW and besides learn everything on Volkswagen.
Rivalizando And of the same way, a lot of companies, like VW, gather  in one struggles body to body around the most privileged minds in collaborations with the universities.
His mission: Hire what before to the students with more talent of the universities, before they go in in the market of work and are hired by others.
And like the universities do not facilitate publications on the skills of his students, tries  atisbar to the exceptional talents in practical projects and attract them.
The second day of project in the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins  to the talents.
A Miss of the department of personnel delivers pens, gomitas and folders with the logo of VW.
It explains to the ilusionados young talents the programs of practices and the works for students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Seal of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
It sees advantages for both parts: "The students go in in contact with the industry and purchase experience."
"To his time, VW can know to the students, observe more than near to the interesting candidates and consider them like possible hard-working futures."
Some collaborations, says Seal, are not little common.
The novelty is in that the students are wished so directly.
"The main point previously found  in the technical projects", affirms Seal.
The fight by the graduated frescos is going back  harder.
In a lot of branches, the companies no longer can choose to his employees between a big group of applicants.
If no that they have to announce and, especially, to achieve a hand of work highly qualified.
All the students of the disciplines of engineering find  in an excellent situation of negotiation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI by his acronyms in German), in October existed 40.000 places of vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognósticos of the VDI, this empty of engineers will grow still more.
In the company of auditoria and advice, KPMG, Roman Dykta commissions  of the hunting of talents.
It organises costly events of contracting, like the career KPMG, a type of yincana modern, in which the participants have to find his way by means of the coordinated of the GPS.
The company wants to send to eight very promising students to USA the following year.
Besides the participants can observe the subsidiaries of KPMG and learn on the company.
It decides  who has to go in two rounds of election in the exit.
Only the crème of the crème of a lot of participants goes to USA
The universities encourage  increasingly in choosing and pulir to the potential heights of the universities, according to Dykta.
"With the career want to stand out of the mass."
"The simple distance by himself only remained us  short."
For the cazatalentos Dykta the notes give resulted.
"Until today we have an alike action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some find  near of his end, and want to request work with us", affirms.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, also are to the hunting, especially, the small and average companies, classical with his fairs of the work.
"We try to achieve students in the skilled fairs."
"Something on Intersolar", affirms Sitha Stübe, attendant of personnel for the manufacturer of solar technology Solarworld.
The company Bonner has roughly 1.500 employees in Germany.
Stübe Knows the problematic of the new generation.
At present in the page web of the company appear 35 vacant places.
"It is being very complicated to fill up the vacant places."
"It costs long and money", affirms.
A shorter way is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld Collaborates with several upper schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The professors advise that they can do  practices with us or realise his theses.
They do not realise  expensive advertising campaigns for the solar specialists.
Therefore the company needs promocionarse with other advantages: personal Environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A big consortium usually can not offer it", declares Stübe, the attendant of personnel.
In the research of an employment, the money no longer is the most important.
The decisive factors are time of flexible work, assistance to boys or good possibilities of promotion.
According to a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld has the square 55 between the 100 better empleadores of Germany.
The institute elaborates an annual list of the best providers of German employment.
For what asks to the employee the satisfied that is with the work and with the environment in the same and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the attendant of personnel also expects extra points in his classification by his applicants to work.
"I think that the applicant fixes  especially in the external classifications of a potential empleador", affirms.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler Of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises to the companies that want a strategy on a long-term basis that they win  a good fame like empleadores.
It advises to his clients more authenticity.
And this means, according to Kriegler, especially, internal measures.
"The best way to do  attractive like empleador goes through the own employees", ensures.
In the slang of the sector calls  Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity inside the own staff.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When it treats  well to the people and identify it with the company, then achieves  promotion directly for the empleador by part of friends and known.
"It is like a game with gang", affirms Kriegler.
Obama detains new perforaciones oil
From the coast of the American state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years any new perforación oil.
The government of Washington issued a conclusive prohibition and with this cancelled his previous plans of unappealable way.
Also in front of the atlantic coast remain new perforaciones vedadas by the moment.
This announced the minister of the interior, Ken Salazar, the Wednesday.
What caused this strict prohibition, that at least will be in force the following five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the life to eleven workers and caused the main environmental catastrophe of the USA, the president Barack Obama had admitted new perforaciones in splits it west of the gulf of Mexico under pressure of the opposition and of the industry.
The adherents wanted like this diminish the dependency of USA of new supplies of oil of the foreigner.
Until today it has not cleared  of the all of who is the responsibility of the irreparable oil slick in the gulf.
In the centre of the critic finds  the British energetic consortium BP, that is enfrentado with million demands.
A commission of investigation commissioned by Obama will present his results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, raised the moratorium of perforación after the explosion.
Later, distinct consortiums peteroleros presented applications for new attempts of perforación.
Obama and Salazar want to descartar a new catastrophe employing some harder controls and some regulations of security more strict.
At present the authority of responsible control, that after having been accused of charges of corruption has fallen in descrédito, reforms  of root.
Obama announces of parallel way that will close  the lagunas fiscal yielding for the consortiums of the oil and of the gas.
The industry announces publicly that the total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to a more strict regulation, to date.
"The plans of the government are the main brake for the growth of the industries of the oil and of the gas", says the result of the current poll realised by the company aide BDO - before the prohibition of extraction of the Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance Complains of the insecurity in the sector: "Anybody knows what changes exactly with the regulation."
The investments in new projects of extraction  prolongan for now, to the detriment of the growth.
Ogonilandia Is ruined
The water of the rivers is márrón oil, smells like a gasolinera: Million litres poured of crude have shattered the nature in the Nigerian Ogonilandia.
The people lives of the theft, the corruption and the illegal trade of oil.
To Celestine Akpobari seems him well.
"You do not tire you", it reassures the environmental activist to the journalists: "Today it will happen sufficient oil in front of your eyes."
The Nigerian of 37 years has achieved to photograph to boys vadeando in the water until the breast with the shine of the lights reflected in turbulences in the surface: With the colorido shine of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It does not see  that on the surface float brown stains of oil.
Before here it took shrimps to bunches, explains Esther Badom in the bank of the river Bodo-Jetty.
While, the fluent waters are totally dead.
Five years ago it poured  in the formidable humedal an impressive quantity of oil by a pipe broken.
The fishes of the surroundings of the small city of Bodo had to swim six hours to arrive to full waters of fishes: That, in the heart of the delta of the Niger and situated in Ogonilandia, considers  like one of the most stunk regions of the world.
On the way of the route of the river that goes through mangroves, the extensive desolation results obvious.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the ship stirs up a brown broth, the one who submerge his hand in the water, will take out some full of oil.
The raices of the trees of the mangroves elevate  from the soil like dark sticks of licorice, sadly aislan the palmeras that bump and hang his palms.
In vain they look for  bandadas of birds, as if they were in the humedal as always: In what  calla the barrier of the outside, expands  in her a species of calm fantasmal of a previous paradise with smell to gasolinera.
"What here occurs is an ecological fight", affirms, huraño, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in danger constant for the health."
It proceeds the comparison bélica.
The zone of the settlement of the ogoni is an argued field of battle from does years: Here they burst into it does more than 60 years the first European navigators, here organised  the first resistance in the years 80 with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the consortium Shell in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of the oil.
Still nowadays it is forbidden the return of the companies to Ogonilandia: While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold of all the region of the delta, of a thrice main size that Switzerland, with more than 5.000 sources of extraction and 7.000 kilometres of pipes, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were calm, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Each two hundred metres projected platforms of steel like estrafalarias sculptures of the water: "Arbolitos of navidad" called fondly to the heads of the punches.
They have until 50 years, the majority present a total corrosion.
To each instant fails a cabezal, thinks Akpobari, then mana a chorro constant of oil in the water.
According to the assessments of the experts, have poured  more than two thousand million litres in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the quantity of oil penetrates, as in the averia of the fuselage "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the main catastrophes ecólogicas of the history of the mankind.
The one who was responsible of the durable environmental region, lidiará with this.
Whereas the consortium of Shell and the thefts organised of oil are responsible of more than the 90 percent of the pollution, the environmentalists see to the cabezales ready to break  and to the pipes with escapes like the main causantes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low standards of security usually in the world the conventional, reproached the scientific Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the indexes of defects of the pipes are "on a main multiple that elsewhere".
In a place, that from far seems forgotten, appears a full workshop of oil under the free sky, arise figures of between the mangroves: they Are nude and covered of oil.
Between one of the a lot of barrels, that sometimes are joined to the perforaciones, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the terrain, flamea a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats  in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the boss of the group.
In the first place, the petrol penetrates by means of the pipes in the container, later the pipe of oil beads and finalemente goes out diésel.
Of this way, Michael and four employees produce daily until four barrels of diésel of 300 litres: "it contributes Us 34.000 naira", around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the main oil states of the black Africa.
Nigeria only has an only refineria.
With the absurd and cheap price of the diesel of hardly 40 euros-cent by litre the illegal heaters can offer still less: Like this they reduce the value of his prime matter.
It comes from of "the ones of the bunkers", that trucaron the network of pipes that crosses Ogonilandia: According to the experts, to this step lose  at least 16 million litres of oil to the day in all the delta of the Niger.
Only an insignificant part of the material provisional premium stored  refina clearly of illegal form: The criminal networks organised, to which also belong political and high military charges, save the best part in aljibes and sell it cheap in the world-wide market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on if the environmental catastrophe has to  rather to the handle of the population or to the toneless way of production.
"If the oil did not comport  like invasoras and had not destroyed completely the natural habitat of the fishes, there would be sabotage, neither thefts, neither refinerias illegal."
Whereas the conditions of the ogoni are shattered especially by Shell until the point that only appears a deduction of the consortium: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese."
Michael puts  nervous.
"Already it goes being time to that you disappear", says the musculoso Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes to the refinadores illegal, does not loom them with arresting them, if no with a painful bribe.
The north pertinent soldiers also want to, as all the Nigerians, take out provecho of the prime matter.
"This convict invent has done pieces completely to our country", affirms Akpobari.
The researchers detect defects of dangerous factory in the engines of the To380
When seeming, the To380 has a big problem of security.
In an investigation of a machine that realised a landing forzoso, the researchers found a possible defect of factory, that can produce "a failure catastrófico in the engine".
The airline Qantas wants to sue to the manufacturer of the engine.
The passengers of the Airbus of Qantas that realised a landing of emergency at the beginning of November had a lot of more luck that the one who can imagine : The authorities of Australian aerial security perceived thanks to his investigations a big problem of security in the engines of some To380, and alert of a possible defect of factory.
The potential defect has repercussions complicated: In a connection of manguitos, can cause  fissures by fatigue or cracks, announced the authorities of the ATSB in a report published the Thursday.
This could have caused "a failure catastrófico in the engine".
This affected to the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce pertaining to 20 aeroplanes of the series To380.
Between which finds  the Qantas-Airbus that it had to realise a landing forzoso on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal averages against the manufacturer of British turbines.
It presented a demand in the federal court of Sidney that made possible more juridical measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, declared that his airline will demand a compensation by the incident of principles of November.
In the mark of the engine have lost pieces and his wing is dilapidated.
Rolls Royce Distinguishes the type of the petrol like the cause of the damages.
After the incident, until 40 engines of all the world have to be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced that they will effect more proofs of security to the superjumbos gifted with the engines affected.
The recommendation of security is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, affirmed Martin Dolan, spokesman of ATSB.
The problem of security has turned into the sufficiently important as to inform to all the affected.
After the landing of emergency of the device of Qantas, the airline kept to his fleet To380 in earth during a lot of weeks.
Singapore Airlines Kept roughly to three of his eleven To380 temporarily in earth.
Lufthansa Replaced the engine of a To380 like measure of precaución.
This aeroplane with double cover is the aeroplane of passengers bigger of the world.
A Nevada in all the country causes the chaos in the traffic
Germany totally white: Of a day for another has nevado in almost all the country.
In a lot of streets reigns the chaos, fail the trains and the aeroplanes.

The traffic is very limited in the majority of highways and in a lot of streets.
In the To7 to the height of Flensburg, the quitanieves are in continuous operation, removing the new snow one and again, but is not prepared.
Besides, strong series of wind sweep the coast of the sea báltico.
The Maritime Federal Agency and Hydrographic of Germany (BSH) expects spring tides with the level of the water 1,2 metres above his usual level in the coast of the sea báltico Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Sajonia the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems in the highways and in the national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, summons  the red alert in Sächsischen Schweiz, in reality the highest alert.
There there is partially 30 centimetres of snow recently fallen and cold and strong winds commission  of arremolinarla.
There they remained  trapped during the night a lot of trucks and cars.
Also in Sajonia Anhalt the police authorities notified important disorders in the streets.
In the To2, the snow and the wind paralysed the traffic and created atascos.
In Turingia the snowfalls affected to the To4 and to the To9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, expect  big disorders in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and in the north of Baviera.
The snow in the road, the trees fallen on the lanes or the catenary shattered and the holes are the main problems.
In Sajonia suspends  the service interurbano of Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Turingia a train ICE had to detain his trip to Munich.
The firemen and the service of rescue attended to the 165 passengers in the train with blankets of wool, food and drunk.

However, there are few passengers varados in the airport, in spite of this there are 400 beds of ready campaign for them.
In a lot of streets, the Wednesday in the afternoon already there were a lot of accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train in a crossing of road in Ostholstein.
The maquinista suffered slight wounds.
In the vicinities of Nuremberg produced  a similar accident owing to the streets snowfalls: Also here a truck was achieved in a crossing of roads because the vehicle remained  atrancado.
The driver lost the life.
In the train four passengers resulted injured, the route of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked by this reason in the morning.
Besides it died a woman of 30 years, after giving a dump with his car near of Aschaffenburg in a slippery road.
The meteorologists have a good news: The snow will be increasingly soft and type dust and therefore  arremolinará in soft series.

Deusche Bank Looks for a buyer for his towers twins
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate of his symbol: According to an article, the financial institution looks for buyer for his towers of offices in his headquarters of Frankfurt.
The property could contribute until 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank fixed his headquarters:  modernizaron the towers twins in the neighbourhood of the banks of Frankfurt; while the bankers went back to his place of ancient work.

The spokesman does not appoint the reasons of the sale in project.
"Always we check if it suits to possess the properties or sell them and to continuation go back to rent them", affirmed.
Therefore the main institution crediticia of Germany goes back to renounce to the headquarters of his company after a short period of time.
The bank purchased the towers twins around the middle of 2007 by 272 million euros of the investor of a bottom of the house and to continuation realised him the pertinent arrangements.
The energetic reforms achieved some figures of roughly 200 million euros.
A sale would suppose a lot of money for the bank.

If they sell  the buildings renewed in a bottom of the bank or to an independent investor has not been revealed at present, affirmed the spokesman.
Miles of people in mourning by the miners died
In New Zealand, more than 10.000 people thought in the miners sepultados, that gave  by died after a lot of explosions in a mine.
Todavia Have not been able to  find the corpses, because the measures of security keep on being precarious in the place of the misfortune.
It does almost two weeks took place an intense explosion in the mine Pike River near of the city of Greymouth.
29 miners of ages between 17 and 62 years remained buried in the mine.
It entered  a probe in the place of the misfortune, but did not discover any signal of survival.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, any team of rescue could go down by reasons of security.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there were not possibilities that the miners had survived.
They have not been able to  recover the bodies to date.
At present the familiar and friends remember to the died with a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplandeciente shine of the sun in Greymouth in the neozelandesa south island.
They save silence during two minutes.
In homage of the miners sepultados, placed  29 tables with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
Also there were photographies and personal objects, below pieces to dress and tables of surf.
The flags waved at half-mast in front of the governmental buildings of the country.
New Zealand expected that the miners went back to the surface "of the depths of the earth", said John Key, the president of the government neozelandés, to the participants of the memorial act.
"But never they went back home."
It can not assume the death of his son until it have not seen his body, affirmed Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was sepultado in the mine.
Beside the president of the government and to the familiar of the victims participated in the memorial act a lot of diplomatic foreigners.
In the first explosion on 19 November also were sepultados miners of British and South African origin.
The workers of rescue began extinguishing a fire in the interior of the coal mine in the south island of New Zealand.
In what they have extracted  the explosive gases, the temperatures abrasadoras of the interior of the mine will begin to descend, declared Gary Knowles, the upper of the police, to the journalists.
To the devil, warrior!
The gore fits in the artistic cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn goes back to explore the borders of the gender with his epopeya of battles "Walhalla Rising".
In which public will have thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A warrior vikingo prisoner with an alone eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees  of his torturadores and murderer to his enemies with fights almost sobrehumanas, sounds ideal for young viewers that look for bloody action, precisely because to our hero likes him employ brutal methods to kill and start to his enemies the tripas of his bodies with life when it is of bad humour.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it calls  in reality, does not say almost any word during all the film and the others characters leave  carry by as a lot one or two sentences or a pair of penosos mortal cries.
Of the contrary  callan and enjoy of the beautiful and terroríficos landscapes montuosos of Scotland, that the frames offer to the world vikingo of does roughly one thousand years.
Rather ideal for cineastas grown and interested in the existentialism and in movements of camera very calmed.
When a film has several groups of addressees is a penalty that can not  descartar mutuamente.
The director Winding Refn considers to his wild and to the trilogy on the combed drug trafficker "Pusher" like a species of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but denies  estoicamente to do that his works are for all the publics with something more than humour in the main current or something less than brutality of the artistic house.
A cerebral mass and some tripas that brotan can not deter the majority of the supporters of the artistic cinema.
The majority of the fans of the action die  of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalén with a troop of missionary cristioneros violent by interpretable reasons and remains  atascado an eternity in the calm and the fog before his team arrive to America and go back to callarse there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" have not found cinematographic distributor in Germany and only publish  in DVD.
It is a calamity against the glorious images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody façade, hides  a piece of cinema sometimes excitante, that deserves something of attention.
This film does not treat of dialogues neither of a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed in film.
And therefore there is not escapatoria for the viewers.
Refn  condede Hardly a moment of relaxation and his images glaciers and the lúgubre soundtrack of hardship do him a knot in his throat, especially, the incredible hate, that from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a small blond youngster, that supports to Unojo faithfully, conserves something like innocence, all the other are possessed by the ire.
Especially, the hero of an alone eye, whose reasons do not explain  never, turns into any moment in a warrior gone out of the hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
The represents the perdición, but maybe only for which are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" Is a mysterious film that can hate  and admire, to anger , alter and surprise.
An experience.
Mysterious movements of earth
The organisation of nuclear energy OIEA has new indications of a nuclear program secret in Syria.
The country refuses to think on this subject until they allow  controls.
On the half night of the 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli aeroplanes of fight F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It finds  in the bank of Éufrates; the main city and nearer, to 30 kilometres is Dair ace-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Organism of Atomic Energy (OIEA), treats on a reactor that when seeming the Syrians built with help of North Korea in the cube, hid in a valley that goes out of the river.
According to information of the service of international intelligence of USA of the CIA of finals of April of 2008, design  a common reactor under the name of the vicinities of the-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which build  the nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technician hardly serves for other ends that for the ones of the years fifty.
The CIA showed a presentation in video with images of blurred satellite.
They showed with an animation by computer where were the components of the reactor before the destruction, that was a copy reduced of the model norcoreano of the nuclear head office of Yongbyon.
Besides they taught photographies that showed the building from the vicinities or from the interior.
It did little time that the reactor was in operation, says, but still was not instrumented with bars of fuel.
Today, three years later of the bombardment, is hardly more known that then, the enigmas did  main over time.
The previous president of the USA, George W. Bush desveló recently in his memories that before the attack the CIA was totally sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the-Kibar, but that hardly saw indications that in the country existed "a program of nuclear weapons".
In Europe, several agents of the secret service prefer to be still more careful and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider "valid" the presentation of the CIA.
They are missing them solid proofs, as well as to the OIEA.
When it asked him  the safe that it was to have by in front a reactor, a diplomatic height of the NU answered in summer of lapidarian way that the OIEA has "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians undid  with a lot of rapidity of the demolitions of the presumptive "military building inutilizado" and allanaron the terrain to consciousness.
Nevertheless, in June of 2008 a team of the OIEA under the control of the previous inspector boss Olli Heinonen found rastos of uranium in the-Kibar, that had been manufactured by people.
Besides the OIEA obtained images by satellite on a been member, of commercial vendors in the just moments after the attack, that have to have a main informative value of which presented the CIA.
Nevertheless, these photographies did not arrive to the market because an unknown client, maybe Israel, bought them of exclusive way.
Therefore the OIEA can not verify his authenticity independently.
Syria always gave to understand that it never had had a nuclear program secret neither built any reactor.
The uranium proceeded of the Israeli arms, explained Damaskus.
The OIEA refused it like inverosímil after the analyses of the particles.
Since Damaskus denies  to argue in this regard, of equal way that with regard to the images by satellite.
Besides, to the controllers forbids them  a second inspection in the-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the building bombed.
Also Israel saves a strict silence.
"Never we will comment it", Ehud Olmert, prime minister in functions in the moment of the attack, confirmed recently the official position.
Like this, the investigation of the case has not given results from June of 2008 and "transforms  progressively in a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", like a diplomatic western of high charge corresponds  with a place in the OIEA in Vienna, finally is slope a grave infringement against the treaty of no proliferation of atomic arms, by which watches the OIEA.
The OIEA considers three teams more like the key for the progress in the esclarecimiento, that have to be "in functional connection" with the presumptive reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not given to know publicly until the moment of which teams treat , neither which functions have, neither if they seem suspicious.
According to the periodic Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has designated like internal to Marj ace-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived of the vicinities of the cities situated.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near of Masyaf with the images by satellite, that very probably treat  of one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly it finds  in or immediately at the side of a military base, Syria forbids with this reason the entrance to the three places to the OIEA.
In Vienna says  that the Syrians fear a register that the USA have requested to the OIEA to spy the military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert on the teams thanks to the warnings of the secret service of the USA
By means of photographies by satellite, the OIEA has indications that it moves  material between the three places and the cube to the bank of the Éufrates.
A diplomatic western with a high charge in Vienna affirmed that at least one of the teams can be "related with the production of fuel".
But there is not "any indication of sensitive activities", neither of enrichment of uranium neither of reacondicionamiento; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor  acciona with uranium that was not enriched.
Of where it has to come the uranium and where has to separate later the plutonium for the bombs, for these central questions there is, in the best of the cases, valid suppositions.
Neither there are doubts on if the ruins, the valuable tracks that can recover, find  in the three places.
As they disappeared the cientos of load of the trucks of the soil, anybody has information on where remain the demolitions.
The OIAE considers unlikely the mine of salt to the-Tibni, situated in the few kilometres from the-Kibar to the another part of the Éufrates, that the Syrians recognised in 1998 by his aptitude like zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous inspector of the OIEA, related it with the reactor in an analysis of the images by satellite for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographies from the orbit show that the Syrians effected movements of earths in the three supposed suspicious places and deleted big containers after the OIEA requested the entrance.
It can be casualidad but hardly contributes to dissipate the suspicion.
Besides, in the diplomatic sector says  that the OIEA has employed some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrians allowed, to keep the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus criticises also this proposal.
The diplomatic western in Vienna does a year reassured  with that the reactor already was destroyed, therefore the subject does not have a lot of urgency, from does a pair of months, Glyn Davies, a type of ambassador of the USA esgrime the called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the nuclear authorities vienesas have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the OIEA, that has to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which am opened in the future", but still hesitates.
This way is very risky: For this needs  the majority of the council of government of the OIEA, and some of the 35 there represented countries are not precisely anxious by a climbing.
On the other hand, as reflexionó a diplomatic: "And what happens if at the end they do not find at all?"
The love in the times of the war
there are problems since Angelina Jolie began in summer with the direction of his debut still without name.
She same has written the script, a history of love between a bosnia and a Serbian.
It does not know  much more in this regard, but this is sufficient for the agitation.
The rumour is very persistent, the woman, Muslim,  enamora of his Serbian rapist during the war of Yugoslavia.
The associations of women bosnias have protested quickly, with which in the last moment moved some days of rodaje planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has filmed  in Hungary and in the posproducción, but still there are protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic Of the feminine organisation of victims of the war wrote to the High Commissioner of the UN, ACNUR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed to a newspaper bosnio, Jolie is the ambassador of the High Commissioner of the UN for the refugees.
It is not diplomatic, does weeks the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, affirms Hasecic.
They do not give  histories of love in the fields of rapes, and the position of Jolie in this regard delata to the victims the sufficient on the script.
His organisation in accordance with the High Commissioner of the UN for the refugees has recommended destituir to Jolie like ambassador, informs the Guardian.
But what has written exactly Jolie for the scenes?
The ministry of culture bosnio that read the script, awarded after a throw and slackens a permission of recording in Sarajevo, is not of the all clear reason Jolie did not go in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that it does not pursue political purposes with his film, enters  with a lot of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parts involved.
His content keeps on being imprecise.
In the network circulates a second sinopsis of the film that sounds quite distinct: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and go back to find  when she, a bosnia Muslim, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works like policeman.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape  enamora of torturador".
It is safe that the film of Jolie begins really before the war.
The pressure on her, affirms Jolie, is "unfair and based in erroneous information".
At present they can attain the peace with the hackers of Hollywood: Whereas the script is still in the network of illegal way, as many others previously.
At all as far of here
This afternoon at last it goes back to be good for the Irish.
Any trace of affliction
Instead, the team of house dominates on his clients of Sweden, Finland and USA
The fans shout of joy while retumba the high music, strike the soil with the feet.
The club Bailey vibrates in the sudirlandés Cork, because the players launch , and find, balls of pingpong to the glasses of beer from a distance of three metres
The odd show calls  "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner are 500 euros more some tickets of aeroplane to The Vegas for the world-wide championship of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type, this estrafalario game of drink and the discreet computer in reality do not do good crumbs.
And the boy of 26 years tries to amuse with this, distract of the question fulminante, what will offer him the future.
The entertainment in The Vegas is not in his plans, in January will realise a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presentiment", affirms.
"It is very far of house and still do not have work there."
At least: His girlfriend expects him in Auckland, "of a threw achieved the work of his dreams like agent of events, maybe was a good signal", says the youngster and smiles.
Owing to the bad perspectives home, two of the three brothers of Tanners already have looked for luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin works in the actuality like aide of YOU in Londrés.
The youngsters go : In the island there are a lot of families like the one of the Tanners.
100.000 Irish will abandon the country in a near future, predict the experts in economy and the institute of social investigation ESRI of Dublin.
Until 2015 they explain  200.000 emigrants.
A big loss for this small country with alone 4,5 million inhabitants.
The prognoses confirm , comes a comparable migratory wave to which suffered the island in the years eighty.
After a decade of progression that trajó a big welfare to the Irish, in the actuality extends  the melancolía.
The economic crisis confuses especially to the youngsters, Irish very formed, for which up to now, everything is slope up.
The loss of employment and the social descent seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
All need that there is money in abundance.
But three of each ten men and lower women of thirty years are in the unemployment.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director in mass of young emigrants, that complain that: "In Ireland all sinks ."
"It would have to have a lifting against the politicians and the bankers, but the one who can, goes  and loses our country and with this to a whole generation."
"The last that close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, student of right and president of the union of Irish students sees to appear a shady future because the government only devotes  to settings and no longer offers perspectives of future to the young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but do not have strategies to attain new places of work", affirms the girl of 20 years.
It observes like his mates go of some practices no reumneradas to the following.
His main worry, explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and deprimente."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this subject of positive way.
McLarnon Organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the subject to work abroad.
"For which begin to work, do it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career", affirms the manager.
In his page web appear photos of a boy practising surf in Australia and of another practising snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Work abroad is not like doing it in the galeras, if no that comports freedom and entertainment.
From it does half year, Seán Or'Donovan knows how is to build something in another place.
Since no longer there was at all that do for the engineer of 29 years, at present works with 15 Irish mates in the construction in Germany.
Now they raise a shop of fashions in Gelsenkirchen.
In January goes  to Hannover or to Berlin, to the following project.
Or'Donovan sees his homeland only few times because it works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy", affirms, since it does long of the first time that stepped the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I never am so well."
It laughs  something ashamed and goes  by freezing rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential zone with taken care gardens in front of the houses, in the entrance are parked big and expensive cars.
Or'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago by 380.000 euros, 100 by one hundred funded by a credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions", says.
It has fear of fracasar with the credit?
Or'Donovan thinks a while, serves more hot tea and says: "I do not have boys to which have to feed and am young; if all goes out badly, can begin from zero."
To the civil engineer do not like him the complaints that listens often at present.
"Anybody has to be hungry, our situation is not, with a lot of difference, so dramatic as in time happened here in the island", affirms.
"Work a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, maybe with this feel us for the first time like Irish."
It laughs  and account on his father, that in the last big economic crisis went  to England.
"After seven years went back and the life continued in Ireland, very simple."
To Cian Tanner like him these ideas.
Leave slope the future and simply see as it is the life in another part.
Already it worked a pair of years in London and why did not go them to go well to him and to his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But in these days there is a thing that upsets him of to a large extent: the celebration of his 27 birthdays the Friday in Dublin.
It fears that it can degenerar in a party of sacked.
"Only, no too many emotions", says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Sacked, sounds very angustioso."
"Better call it a party to leave, very relaxed, with a pair of friends, a pair of drinks, a pair of games."
The democratic routine
Follows increasing the support to the democracy in Latin America, as well as the backrest to the private companies.
The delinquency generates main worry that the unemployment.
Besides, largely of the region, sees  to Brazil like a more influential country that the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last survey of the Latinobarómetro realised in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has celebrated  regularly from 1995, allows to realise a follow-up of the changes of attitude in the region.
In the results of the survey of this year, realised in September and principles of October, stand out two questions related.
The first is the relatively encouraged humour reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of the attitudes to the democracy and his main institutions.
The support to the democracy has increased considerably in diverse countries of the Pacific coast of Sudamérica (consult the table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economic growth has achieved an average of 6% annual from 2002, the support to the democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It grew also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered  after suffering a big descent of the production the past year.
Nevertheless, so only the half of the respondents of Mexico and Brazil, the two more populated countries of the zone, are democrat convinced, which goes down the regional average (consult the chart 2).
Around 44% of the respondents in the region declared  satisfied with the way in that it works the democracy in the practice in his country, the same figure that the past year, but considerably upper to 25% registered in 2001 (graphic 3).
Around 34% affirmed that they trusted the Congress of his country and 45% in his Government, the same quantity that the year happened in both cases, but considerably upper in relation with 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
It does a decade, the economic turbulences in Latin America affected gravely to the support to the democracy.
The fact that it have kept  during the world-wide financial crisis probably was due to that numerous Latin American countries so only saw  affected by a brief recession and enjoyed of a strong recovery.
Besides, the existence of a social network of security stronger has contributed to protect to the poorest.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America informed this week that the proportion of Latin American that live in conditions of poverty so alone increase marginally in 2009 and that has reduced  again this year, until 32%.)
However, the state of spirit varies considerably of a country to another (consult the chart 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his salient president, Luiz Inácio Lula gives Silva, reflects  in a general feeling of progress.
Said feeling is less common in Mexico and Centroamérica, where the recession was graver and have increased the violent crimes.
For the second time since they began the surveys, more polled in Latin America mention the delinquency, in place of the unemployment, like the gravest problem to the that  enfrenta his country (consult the chart 5).
Around 31% affirms that, was they or a near relative, has been victim of the delinquency in the last year, a figure that has reduced  from 38% of the past year and that it is the lower percentage registered from 1995.
The economic performances more positive reflect  in a main support to the private companies and to the market economy: around 71% of the respondents in the region affirm that the private companies are indispensable for the development, whereas in 2007 so only was 56% (consult the chart 6).
Around 58% agrees in that the market economy is the only system that will allow that his country develop , in front of 47% the past year.
It results interesting that 62% of the respondents in Venezuela think the same (and 80% backs to the private companies), although his left-handed president, Hugo Chávez, is expropiando numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exerts a main leadership in the region, such as it indicates 19% of the respondents (in front of 18% the past year), gone on down the United States (9%, same figure that the past year) and Venezuela (9% in front of 11% does a year).
However, United States is the country considered more influential by the respondents in Mexico and big part of Centroamérica, whereas Venezuela has such title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the rubbish
Anybody expected that the general elections celebrated on 28 November in Haiti went perfect.
However, they passed of an a lot worse way of what feared  the foreigners that try to help to the country to trace back after his problems.
They entered  votes in the urns, some people voted several times, papeletas thrown in the scuppers, electoral schools destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, included groups displaced by the earthquake of January, wandered by the zone trying discover where had to vote.
Some of them, at the end, gave  by defeated.
A dozen of candidates to the presidential, included varied of the most popular, reported fraud and asked the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, extended  by all the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the civil servant of the United Nations of main rank in Haiti, declared that they were "some relatively good elections in a lot of senses."
The observers of the Organisation of American States and of the Community of the Caribbean affirmed, with cautela, that "do not think that these irregularities, by bass that are, invalidate necessarily the process".
In other words the show continues.
The electoral authority, that according to his opponents is engaged with René Préval, the unpopular salient president, and with his candidate, Jude Célestin, would have to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
It foresees  that the desempate will realise  in January.
Still they have not lost  all the hopes in relation with the elections.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapero, and Mirlande Manigat, an ancient first lady, have withdrawn his initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But still they can arise problems if the electoral authority declares that the gentleman Célestin, that hardly has support, if it has any, has happened to the second round.
Taking into account that the epidemic of the cholera arrasa the country and more than one million the survivors of the earthquake follows living in shops, expects  a big abstention.
Arrived the moment, a lot of Haitians wanted to vote, but did not attain to do it because of a fault of organisation.
Around 250.000 documents of identity, necessary to vote, still had not distributed  shortly before the elections.
There is a lot at stake.
The donors of help consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has remained patent, also think it the own Haitians.
Advancing on tiptoe to the centre
In the weeks that have passed since it lost to his husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed of a big charm between the public that has increased his index of popularity in 20 points, until more than 50%, the main level that has registered from his election in 2007.
In spite of everything, that can turn it into a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of the next year will depend of if the clearly affected lady Fernández leaves sideways the intransigencia of his deceased husband, his predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this point, the indications are not conclusive.
The gentleman Kirchner, that followed doing charge of the economic politics even after his wife him sucediese like president, had the habit to elaborate budgets that infravaloraban the fiscal income, the economic growth and the inflation.
This allowed to the presidential marriage spend the additional income to his discretion.
In theory, the government of the lady Fernández lost his majority in the Congress the past year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after the demise of Kirchner owing to a cardiac attack on 27 October.
Some members discrepantes of the movement peronista in being able to have  enfrentado to the lady Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which a deputy gave him a puñetazo to another in the face and other deputies accused to the government of bribe, the Congress decided to refuse the budget of 2011.
"I do not go to argue", said the president.
The budget of 2010, in consequence, will apply  to the next year, what will offer to the president a margin of action still main to the hour to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: probably it grow until 9% this year.
The tax of official inflation finds  at present in 11,1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the exigencias salariales of the unions, situate it near of 30%.
The gentleman Kirchner, that assumed the power in 2003 when Argentina was to the edge of the collapse economic, did that the growth and the reduction of the poverty went his priorities, in place of the control of the inflation.
It denied  to negotiate with the FMI, presionó to the private sector and did that the INDEC, the institute of statistics, adapted the official statistics of inflation.
It will moderate now the president Fernández these politics?
It has summoned meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
Besides, his civil servants affirm that they want to limit the increases salariales the next year to 18%.
The economy has seen  promoted by the high prices of the Argentinian agricultural exports in the world.
However, the inflation has limited the impulse to the growth achieved with a big devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps by it is reason the lady Fernández is giving signals to want to restore the financial bonds of Argentina with the rest of the world.
To starts of the year, the government arrived to an agreement with the headlines of bonos that had denied  to a restructuring forzosa previous of the debt that Argentina had not credited in 2001.
In the actuality, seems that the lady Fernández is about to to celebrate an agreement with the governments creditors grouped in the Club of Paris, to the that has to around 6.700 million dollars.
The Kirchner always insisted in that this would not involve the supervision of the FMI, as it is used to to be usual.
However, the past month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Bottom will offer "technical assistance" to elaborate a new index of prices to the national consumption, which seems the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It does not remain clear if the President Fernández wants to be still in the politics when it finish his mandate, taking into account that it no longer has to his husband to his side.
If it does it, it will need to win the support of the half class, big part of which has tired  of the kirchnerismo.
When the Argentinians return of his holidays estivales in March, the wave of charm by her will have waned.
If it wants to win other elections, will have to decide if repudia or no, with tranquility, many of the politics of his husband.
Half hurra by China
The voters of Taiwan are approaching slowly to a species of union nearer with the continent.
What think Taiwan on his big brother just across the narrow?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, attended on 27 November to choose to the mayors and councillors of five urban districts in what it seems a wide evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
The own gentleman Ma has gone back  a defensor of the feelings by the continent, forging innovative business bonds, including a pact of free partial trade, the main changes in the relations with China from 1949.
The gentleman Ma happened the proof, but by little.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) finished winning three of the five elections to city council, did not attain to obtain the majority of the votes.
In his place, the democratic progressive Party (PPD), that has bent  by a total independence of Taiwan, obtained practically 50% of all the votes in front of 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the presidential, the gentleman Ma would be in problems.
From his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has diminished in around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD empató with the KMT in the city councils.
In the elections could see  the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy trucks of campaign and big agglomerations with banderitas and light girls of clothes dancing.
Neither it was missing the mysterious attempt of murder of rigour.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, president honorario of the KMT, was campaigning by one of the candidates of the KMT the night before the elections.
A man of the crowd shot to the youngster directly to the face, injuring him and killing to a transeúnte.
The curious is that it has not been able to  determine if the man pretended to hurt him to Lien or avenge of the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected to the elections, seeding suspicions on the PPD and causing that the voters bent  by the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It resulted surprising that did not treat  the subject of the continent in himself.
In his place, the candidates spoke of plans of public accommodation and creation of employment.
Taiwan usually enjoys of his de facto independence and detests the military threat of China.
Therefore, the KMT is used to to avoid give advertising to his bonds with the government in Peking.
But this time also the PPD avoided to encourage the feeling against China.
It answers to the new consciousness that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
By his part, the gentleman Ma affirmed that it had confirmed  that his politics regarding China was acceptable for the majority of the Taiwaneses.
It foresees  that the Government of Peking follow bribing them with the trade, of compliance with his strategy to attain that Taiwan go back to the redil.
China did not lose the time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of the investments and the medical cooperation.
Definitely, it would like him achieve likewise the political integration, but the first is the first.
The best will be to expect to that they happen the presidential elections of 2012 for this.
In any case, the PPD has  reinventado.
Two years ago it found  in a bad situation: his ancient leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, abetted openly the explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of the lady Tsai, has arisen a new generation of moderate and the PPD is encouraging  for attracting to professionals and young.
The lady Tsai has been received gratamente like candidate of the PPD for the presidency, to the equal that His Tseng-chang, that fulfilled mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing all the possible for showing that it also can have relations with Peking.
The lady Tsai announced the plans of creation of a group of experts that act like point of contact between the PPD and China, whenever they can carry out the with no conditions previous negotiations.
The lady Tsai says to the Taiwanese public that his party represents a "reliable alternative" to the precipitated approach of the gentleman Ma regarding China.
The gentleman Chen seems raging by the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, affirmed that the candidates of the PPD had gone out better stopped if they had insisted in that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even it ordered to the gentleman His, a pragmatic, that did not present to the presidential.
Even without that interceda the gentleman Chen, the PPD will have difficulties to choose between his possible candidates.
The KMT also has to do an examination of consciousness.
The assessments of the gentleman Ma have been poor, in spite of the impressive economic growth; the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to campaign with him.
His fault of popularity seems to have to mainly to the unemployment and to the increasing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman of the KMT affirms that it will restructure his cabinet, as well as the local teams.
The big samples of the PPD suggest that the support of Taiwan to an approach is limited.
At the same time, the majority of the Taiwaneses consider that the economic integration with China is unavoidable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a known columnist, "already has crossed  the point of no return."
Nominaciones To the Grammy: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is the election surprise in the category of Artist disclosure.
It acts on request of a president and possibly the people will fix  in you.
Esperanza Spalding, the bassist and singer of jazz of 26 years selected personally by the President Obama to act in his ceremony of the Nobel Peace prize in 2009, supposed one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nominación of high level in the category of Better Artist Disclosure.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of the jazz from his album of 2008, "Esperanza", the nominación gives what think, but respects the norms of the Grammys according to which has to be an artist that have not taken out to the market more than three albums before recording the one who "determines the public identity of said artist".
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", definitely supposed a big advance and, taking into account his light vocal style and pleasant, as well as a big skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, can  at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the voters of the Grammys, that lately have concentrated  in the field of the jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy did honour with reason to "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, a thrilling and glorious disk that was one of the favourites the past year.
Between the competitors of Iyer finds  the veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the typist John Beasley by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favourite in New Orleans and invited usual in "Treme", of the HBO, was honoured in the category of contemporary jazz, that by the rest bends  considerably to the fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society obtained a deserved recognition in the category of big groups, competing against the big jazz of camera of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", went a big example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in his band.

The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of legislation
The project of mosque for Temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the commission of local legislation after more than five hours of public evidences, often warmed up.
The critics attacked the project saying that it boosts the terrorism and the atascos.
However, the members of the commission decided the Wednesday at night that the new religious centre respected the local legislation and would be impressive from the aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show his support, so many Christians like Jewish or bahaíes, of all the religions", said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic centre of the valley of Temecula, the Thursday in the morning.
"The truth is that, like American citizen, me enorgullece".
"It shows that it prevails the justice".
"The opposition is really minimum", adds.
"Only that speak very high".
"In this valley there are wonderful people".
The meeting began to the six of the afternoon and lasted practically until half night; the main part of the time devoted  to people that intercedía in favour or against of the centre, practically the same quantity in each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued in the website of the newspaper.
"United States no longer exists", reads  in one of the comments.
"It treats  of another Planet of the apes with the lady Libertad died in the sand".
"America has fallen".
The plans of construction of Islamic centres have caused protests also in other parts of the country, included near of the zone zero, the zone of New York where produced  the attacks of 11 September 2011.
In the Valley of Temecula, the magnet Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation closely of 135 families carries years conviviendo without problems in the county of Riverside, but wanted a main and better space that the warehouse that rented in a property shared with a manufacturer of systems of filtered of water.
The new mosque of 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would elevate  until the 43 feet.
It would occupy a surface of 4,32 acres in Nicolas Road, to around two miles to the east of the institute Chaparral.
The opponents still can resort the project in front of the municipal Council.
A resistant microbe to the arsenic poses the possibility of new forms of life in the Earth... Or in other places
The discovery of an odd bacterium that can use the arsenic like one of his nutrients expands the possibility to find new forms of life in the Earth and, possibly, in other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here in the Earth, say that it shows that it is possible that there are forms of life without the main elements that considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can grow it was with phosphorus or with arsenic".
"This turns it into something very peculiar, although little it is missing him to be a type of form of life really 'alien'", commented Paul C. W. Davies Of the Arizona State University, coautor of the report that appears in the edition on line of the Thursday of the publication Science.
From it does time, considers  that there is six big essential elements for the life: the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, the oxygen, the phosphorus and the sulphur.
However, the researchers have discovered that the bacterium, found in Monkey Lake, California, can keep growing after substituting the phosphorus by the arsenic.
"It does you pose you what more is possible", affirmed Ariel D. Anbar Of the Arizona State University, coautor of the report.
As it indicated Anbar, the finding is important for the research of life in different planets of the Earth, since the researchers need can recognise the life, know the appearance that has.
The study centres  in a microbe discovered in the Earth.
Nevertheless, the announcement of a press conference to debate it, in which they did not spread  details of the discovery, generated a big speculation in Internet on the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not do it.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary surroundings, could have organisms that use other elements to promote his biochemistry and that the group of standard "elements" that consider indispensable for the life perhaps was not so fixed", commented Charles Cockell, chair of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell Did not form part of the team of investigation.
"This work is new because it shows the replacement of an element by another in the biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure", added Cockell.
The discovery did not realise  by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the institute of astrobiology of the NASA, that directed the study, centred  in the Monkey Lake because it presents high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and the phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, by what especuló that an exposed microbe to both could substitute one by another.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because his chemical behaviour is similar to the of the phosphorus".
"In consequence, can result him complicated to the organisms differentiate them".
"However, the arsenic is the sufficiently different as so that it do not work so well like the phosphorus, by what goes in and, for saying it of some way, toughens the biochemical machinery", explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known like GFAJ-1 and exposed them to concentrations every time main of arsenic, to the that attained to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact to show that it can live with arsenic in his place poses the possibility that it can exist of natural form a form of life that use arsenic, already was in other zones of the Earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic was more common.
Jamie S. Foster, auxiliary professor of microbiology in the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that it can substitute  the arsenic by the phosphorus is not new, but never had found  an example that showed that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the first were of the Earth, signalled, by what the researchers especularon that the first forms of life can have it used.
"Himself That suggests that they could exist other means to generate life, no only the way in that the life formed  in the Earth in the past", indicated Foster, that did not form part of the team of investigation of Wolfe-Simon.
The investigation had the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
They have found  the dogs stolen that were missing in Compton
have found  the two dogs that were missing of the four stolen in front of the motel Bellflower, as they affirmed the officials of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles the Thursday.
The four dogs of competition, two Akitas and two Corgi Welsh Pembroke, disappeared the Tuesday when somebody stole the van Chevrolet Express of 2006 in which they were happening the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as they signalled the authorities.
Two of the canine recovered  the Wednesday in the afternoon and the two remaining found  the Wednesday, late at night, as it informed Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs find  well", affirmed Whitmore.
"They are in good condition".
"They have gone back with his legitimate owners".
Whitmore Did not want to indicate exactly where found  the dogs, in which neighbourhood, neither the circumstances of the discovery.
"it is carrying out An investigation".
"We do not want to say at all", it affirmed Whitmore.
"We are following some tracks".
It could not  find to the owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, so that they did some comment the Thursday.
They gathered  with his two Akitas in a shelter of animals of the county in Downey the Wednesday in the afternoon.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog of 10 months) had not suffered damages.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek pretended to exhibit in the competitions of the zone this week for the Japanese owners of the dogs, followed disappeared until the Wednesday at night.
Peek And Rickard, that live in Redding, were in the city for the national championship AKC/Eukanuba in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention to exhibit to Trace.
The others dogs went them to exhibit in other planned competitions for the previous days to the championship AKC/Eukanuba, as it indicated Peek to The Times the Wednesday.
The south of California is one of the stops in turns it of practically two months that realises the couple participating in canine competitions.
The Monday at night, Peek and Rickard did the check-in in the motel.
Usually they remain  in motels and park the just van in front of the window of his room.
They carried to other three dogs (a child of boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and Brittany, that slept with them in the room of the motel.
But they left to the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the ventanillas slightly opened so that the dogs could breathe cool air.
Peek And Rickard reported the theft of the van the Tuesday to the six of the morning.
Peek Had said that would offer a reward to any one that could drive them until the Corgis, endowed of microchips to identify them.
The Thursday was not clear if it would give  a reward or no.
The lion is smart to roar again, to the time that the restructuring of MGM achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has achieved finally green light to begin again.
The Thursday, a federal judge of failures of New York approved officially the plan "prearmado" by the creditors to erase roughly 5 one thousand million dollars of debt, allanando the way so that the company of entretenimiento of 86 years focus his efforts in the production and première of films and programs of television.
The failure of the Thursday confirms that the plan fulfils with the exigencias of the code of American failure, by what do not exist other legal obstacles so that MGM  relance under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that will turn into the main executives of what will be a study reduced.
The personnel will reduce  of 400 to roughly 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not go out of the Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase close an instrument of credit scheduled of 500 million dollars, to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The bank of investment is at present sindicando the credit, that by his account is contributing with 75 million dollars, and expects  that it was funded around the middle of December.
The process of restructuring of the study began in May of 2009, when the bank of investment Moelis and Co. It was hired to give advice on the necessary management to order his finances, while it struggled to be able to realise payments of interests by 300 million dollars to the year.
In the month of August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex President of Enron and expert in recovery of companies in failure, known by his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The tentativas of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the tribulaciones financial of MGM and satisfy to the more than 140 creditors of the study, required much more time of the expected.
After several months of discussions, to ends of 2009 the parts agreed to put the on sale company.
However, the auction attracted to few postores and any had to pay the more than 2 one thousand million dollars that looked for the creditors.
Before the spring of this year, went back to the table of design while the team of MGM began to work in a plan of restructuring that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, went finally backed by the creditors to ends of October.
When MGM officially go out of the failure in the weeks to come, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive bonuses multimillonarias by his work.
Moelis and Co., that already has received 1,2 million dollars, will obtain a payment of 9,5 million dollars.
The companies of Cooper, that have been collecting 375.000 dollars by month by his services of administration of the company, will receive some "honorarios of success" of 4 million dollars.
Barber And Birnbaum plan to restart the production in MGM, that premièred only a film this year, and gathered an annual blackboard of seven or eight films that will go out in 2012.
Also they plan cofinanciar two films based in "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs concertar a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to fund his part of those two films, that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, that possesses roughly 18% of the debt of MGM, had been treating to fix a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the biggest shareholder.
However, the recent conversations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys Wants to maintain a balance of his budget for gifts
Whereas the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, gone on down, perhaps, the system of video games Microsoft Kinect, both can mean a mella significant in his budget for gifts.
It consider that by the price of an iPad can buy  five bicycles BMX of 99 dollars each one, and a game Kinect slope the same that 10 ropes of classical jump adorned with accounts, or roughly 48 tins of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep his budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited to three vendors of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy by less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the Law of Moore has been working; the technological toy of this year probably will have more power, costing the same and even a bit less compared with the one of the past year.
Besides, while generally there are fewer new toys with websites associated, two of the most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the toys promoted by batteries of button are increasing, as well as the toys with batteries recargables.
Here there are some recommendations.
(All the prices are of Toys "R" Us, except that it was indicated of another way).
The Sing-to-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are toys of peluche of the size of a cobayo that sing a note when they tighten  his barrigas.
A squeeze equivale to a note, and a second squeeze begins to arm a song.
If you buys more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaución: Once that begins to tighten, can not stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking loaned of the technology of Elmo Live of the past year, the doll animatrónico of 14 inches plays games of on duty change like Simóm Says, and can do the lunar step, thanks to his innovative feet articulated with wheels with device of blockade.
The boys that tested the toy used to Mickey like an instructor of dance, although his parents complained by the fault of a control of volume.
If you is a boy of the years 80, can remember to Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a full rucksack of letters of questions designed to convert a walk in car in a session with a fascicle of exercises of autocorrección ocurrente.
If you is receloso to give him to his boy his intelligent telephone, here econtrará three independent alternatives.
MobiGo Of VTech (60 dollars, of 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and the easiest to use, presenting a keyboard qwerty; although the games do not teach with so much efficiency like the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, of 3 to 12 years), is the first tuned important of the line Leapster, with a newer screen and brilliant.
Any version is compatible with the old cartridges.
iXL Of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, of 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the type iTunes to present games and electronic books, and has a slot for cards SD that allows to visualise photos of family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks hardly bigger that a box of cerillas, each one with his own screen LED.
The aim is to arm words placing the blocks in row before the time finish; it is formidable for a competition improvised of armed of words.
They are increasingly the toys that have some class of connection on line.
Based only in his presence in jugueterías, the two bigger are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy him to his son a pet on line in the Club Penguin, for example, can achieve a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Appear Pack, (5 dollars, of 6 to 12 years) that includes a coin with an unseen code.
When you changes the code on line, his son obtains sufficient credits in the shop of the Club Penguin for two articles.
These could include skate on wheels or a toy pet Puffle.
Slightly bigger that the sow of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microrobots promoted by batteries of button.
The false insect moves  quickly on 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It is fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find the exit.
Also it is durable.
Ours was able to leave the table of the kitchen and even happen a while inside the mouth of our dog.
It promotes  a more moderate side of the maintenance of the order in China
Like a sergeant urban instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a square of the city, inspecting with severity to the nervous people to his charge, issuing orders in low voice with military authority.
He wanted that the feminine members of chengguan, the corpulentos policemen of the urban order of China, feared and despised by his wayward forceful measures and his inclination to the violence, communicated one some impression to a bunch of viewers.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, whispered, "how are the beautiful girls!"
Four girls that hardly happened the adolescence with white gloves and green jackets identical olive and trousers adjusted to call the attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly ranged.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on of the hair tied with moños to blue and white lines.
"Personally, I think that they have a normal appearance", said the Mr. Tang, desdeñosamente.
"The models are beautiful".
More than a government has treated to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city ordered that all the new recruits have a title of degree.
The Province of Guangdong changed the green colour grisáceo of the uniforms to a blue purportedly more attractive.
Wuhan, in central China, substituted the use of the strength by looks intimidatorias: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials surrounded to a díscolo carrito of snacks, and observed it with the ceño fruncido constantly during half hour, until the hawker collected his things and left .
Xindu, an urban district of 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a change of radical image.
From 2003, the district has added to his urban police 13 women, on purpose chosen by his appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give him to the coarse police a softer side, feminine.
Lamentably, until Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase the ínfimo respect of China for with these squadrons of the city.
And by a good reason, would argue the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are authorised only to enforce ordenanzas of the city, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the means of Chinese news portray rutinariamente a different reality.
In January of 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed to hits to a transeúnte after having used his cellular to film them while they dissolved a protest against a dump of wastes.
The past year, a manual of training for inspectors of Peking was stolen and published in internet, in which it described  like azotar with efficiency to criminals without doing them sangrar.
This year, a hawker of watermelons of Shanghai suffered cerebral damage after one argue with five officials.
A game of full video of violence, available to download on line, presents to inspectors trained by the Chineses that attack to vendors callejeros.
"Chengguan Has left a scar in the government", regretted  Chinese Daily, a national publication, the year happened after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really punctilious cleaning".
The sceptics say that the current approach is very far of this.
After the district requested through a warning eight new draft feminine in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked  if the women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both things.
The warning of the district asked feminine candidates of 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and the five facial shots harmonious".
They had to have a height above the average, upper to 1,6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retreat to the age of 26 years is compulsory.
The civil servants said that the work was physically too arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"His image is the important thing", said him an anonymous civil servant of district to Rednet.com, a website cuasi governmental.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they fulfil with the requirements, like height, weight, facial shots, etc".
Afterwards it comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
The chengguan feminine are like floreros, said, and added, "in addition to being floreros, will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the office of administration of the city of the district, is not anxious for backing this description.
But it observed that the exigencias of height were standard in a lot of warnings of Chinese work for both sexes.
Afterwards it comes the exigencia of harmonious facial shots.
If this means to be bet, is a matter of debate between the Chineses.
Surely, the handicapped person or desfigurado does not have to present.
"We can not allow that a lame person or a jorobado avenge to work here", said the gentleman Zheng.
"His image would not be well".
Liu Yi, who patrol the Square Baoguang near of a monastery, has 22 years, with his cheeks dyed and a mouth subtly curve.
She does not think that the accent in his appearance was sexista, said.
"You thinks that seem sexy with this uniform?" It asked with a look sardónica.
His mate of work with hoyuelos, Xu Yang, of 21 years, said "Our work has to present the image of the city".
They neither  oponen to his work to determinate time, said, because they warm up ambitions of main career that simply frighten off to vendors in the alleys where supposes  that they circumscribe his business.
Each morning, the squadron  enfrenta more or less to a dozen of vendors ambulantes that launch  on foot or in bicycle, treating to sell so many buns or tazones of tofú as it was possible before being thrown.
"Gentleman Wang, has to leave".
"We have said him many times!" It said the Miss Xu while a vendor escaped  on foot, abandoning temporarily his car thrown by bicycle with guarniciones of noodles.
The officials describe his duties as more monotone that exhausting.
"This is more or less the same each day", said Huang Jing, of 20 years, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine".
A reason is that the feminine officials carecen of the power of his homologous masculine to confiscate the commodity of the vendors.
Only they can loom with reporting to the offenders to his supervisory men.
This tends to protect them of the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, that are common everywhere of China.
This year, cientos of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, incited to riot  afterwards that it scattered  the false rumour that some officials chengguan had murdered to a vendor.
More than a dozen of policemen or officials chengguan resulted injured in the nocturnal episode; 14 vehicles of the government were dumped or set fire.
By the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm hardly is guaranteeed.
Only to two streets of the genial Square Baoguang, where the feminine officials patrullaron this morning, more than 50 people gathered  in a corner.
The officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as it demands the regulation.
The owner of the motorbike shouted groseramente.
The situation stagnated  during 15 minutes before the officials, with bad expensive, opened  step to the codazos until his vehicles and went  quickly with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, of 40 years, a coordinator assigned to the masculine squadron, remained behind, with his white insignia given turn to hide his name.
Like the feminine officials, the coordinators, men of 40 years or more, exert a paper purely of support.
Unlike them, no it teachs them  to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we struggle verbalmente".
"Sometimes we struggle physically", it said the gentleman Li with total naturalidad.
"The main part of the time is the public the one who begins litigates it".
The public prosecutors will not raise charges against the Senator Ensign
The lawyers of the senator announced the Wednesday that the public prosecutors of the Department of Justice have exculpado to the Senator John Ensign of the imputaciones criminal that arose of his affair with an ex assistant of campaign and his efforts to ensure work by means of lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision finishes with the legal threat more serious that enfrenta Ensign, the Republican of Nevada that it was considered like possible presidential candidate Republican for 2012, until the scandal on his affair had national headlines the past year and damaged his career.
The office of Ensign said that it felt  "surely content" by the decision, that arrived afterwards of an investigation of a whole year.
The senator still could enfrentar a disciplinary measure of the committee of ethical of the Senate.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice had informed "us that the Senator Ensign no longer is an aim of his investigation and that does not have any plan to raise charges against him by this subject".
The Department of Justice did not want to do comments on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for a lot of lawyers of ethical out of the Department of Justice, that said that it seemed to have significant proofs to indicate that Ensign could have confabulado for violar a federal criminal prohibition on lobby.
The interviews, the email and other documents that spread  in the first place in October of 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped to Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain yielding work by means of lobby, to attain the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the affair of the senator with her.
The lady Hampton once worked like treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign Put  in contact with several political sponsors to find him work to the gentleman Hampton and pleaded for them after they had hired to the gentleman Hampton to do lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Like Hampton had been recently an assistant of Ensign, was excluded according to the law to do lobby for his ex empleador or the Senate during a year.
The experts in ethical said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, that were fellow intimate before the affair, appeared at variance with the call "revolving door lobbying ban", that looks for to restrict that ex state employees use his connections to do personal businesses.
Of the evidence that has made public , "seemed to be a prime case facie of a conspiracy for violar substantially the statute revolving door", said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington that specialises  in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the civil servants of the Department of Justice rejected to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, the gentleman Brand and other lawyers of ethical said that the department seemed cautious to the hour to accept political processings after several important reverses for his section of public integrity, including the decision of the year happened to abandon the processing against the ex Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges by bad behaviour of procedure.
The federal public prosecutors "are clearly some cowards", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for the Responsibility and the Ethical in Washington, a group of defence that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that the civil servants of the government of high rank now can suppose that the laws do not apply  to them", added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call of a public prosecutor of the Department of Justice the Monday and another call more the next day, saying him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
The team of defence of Ensign had been cooperating with the public prosecutors in the tentativa to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement the Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins Denied  to explain with detail the legal arguments that gave him to the public prosecutors.
"I do not seat me comfortable going in in details on my discussions with the Department of Justice, only can say that we think that they took the just decision", said.
The past month, the Federal Commission of Elections decided to change an investigation in a separate complaint by the group of ethical, that alleges that a payment of 96.000 dollars of the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violó the electoral federal law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have sufficient proofs to show that the money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy Is an important company of Nevada that had supported during long to the senator, which achieved work by means of lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave him to Hampton.
An email sent in December of 2008 showed that after the company accepted to Hampton like lobbista, the boss of cabinet of Ensign, John Lopez, communicated  with Hampton and said him that it was "hammering" the Home Office on a question in dispute.
Ensign Also assisted to a breakfast with Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called to the secretary of transport to establish a meeting for the aerial line after it had hired to Hampton to do lobby.
When by first appeared the news of the affair the past year, Ensign asked him pardon to his constituents and renounced to his position like fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile during a lot of months, two weeks ago Ensign said him to the journalists that planned to posit to a third mandate in the Senate.
When the spokesman of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign no longer was object of a criminal investigation, said that the senator expected that the committee of ethical followed quickly the example of the Department of Justice and concluded his investigation.
"The Senator Ensign has wishes to continue with his difficult work for the people of Nevada", said.
The appeal of Cheshire will aim to Twitter
there was half dozen of them "chateando" in the rows of the room of the court.
Minute to minute, sent reports of the frightful evidence via Twitter.
At the end, it says the defence, there was more than 140.000 messages of Twitter on the process that tackled the rape and the boys tied to his beds in a house that was set fire.
The Thursday, the widely followed process of Steven J. Hayes, the one who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is smart to arrive to an official end, with the imposición of the judge of the penalty of death voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of the gentleman Hayes have presented writings in the court that delinean the arguments of the appeals that probably will occupy to the courts during years.
One of the more provocativos affirms that the intense reports on the process, included the wide use of Twitter by part of the journalists of means of massive information, created "an atmosphere of circus", and such saturation generalised and immediate with details exaltadores did that the public passions exerted an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The catchword could force to the judges of appeal to lidiar with the question of if the new technology requires new rules in the room of the court.
"As far as I experienced during this process, think that there is a true danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the room of the court was affecting the rights of the individual to have a just process", said Thomas J. Ullmann, main lawyer of the defence of the gentleman Hayes.
The judge of first instance Jon C. Blue, of the State Upper Court, refused lacónicamente the demands in a failure the past week, saying that the means of news were "carefully controlled" and that there was not any proof that the jury have been carried by the passion.
But probably it will not be the last word on the subject.
During decades, the courts of appeal have recognised that the coverage of cases celebrate can generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In a historical failure of 1966, the Supreme Court of United States revoked the conviction of a osteópata of Cleveland, the doctor Sam Sheppard, by the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" because of the media.
It thinks that  the crime had been inspired by the program of television and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals that examined the conviction of the gentleman Hayes half century later, could feel intrigados by the argument that they could be necessary new rules to control the form of communication from the rooms of the court, something inimaginadable in the period of the case of the doctor Sheppard.
"There is a general reason of worry on the impact of the new media" in processes of high profile, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of the School of Laws of Stanford, that studied the penalty of death of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it said  that this was imposed arbitrarily.
The professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal could feel intrigados by the idea that limit the immediate communication from the rooms of the court could do that the trials were juster.
The question of Twitter is only one of many of the subjects delineados by the lawyers of Hayes, that probably will be argued during years, delaying an execution.
The lawyers of the defence also affirm, for example, that Hayes could have been prejudiced when the Judge Blue rejected to allow them that testearan the reactions of the potential juries, showing them hair-raising photographies of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that were horrified by the photographies of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, of 48 years, and his daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
The lawyers of the defence say that they also will question the constitutionality of the penalty of death and will sustain that the judge wrongly stirred up to a jury that had criticised to the public prosecutors, and that wrongly there was presionado for a verdict by his odd decision to order him to the jury deliberar during a weekend.
The juries were not kidnapped.
But his arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract the main part of the interest.
They observed in a recusación to the verdict filed the past month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was argued during the electoral campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate of United States.
They argued that the media continuously threw firewood to the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of the tweets of the means, the cameras and the reporters out of the court", wrote the lawyers, "went something never seen here in New Haven and maybe in all the state".
His attention in the coverage of Tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news were more important that the reports delivered more slowly, were a vision ludita that would do that the politics of the court on the control of the coverage was feeble in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal often felt  attracted by the arguments on the adaptation that required  in the courts because of the social and technological changes.
The lawyers of Hayes are presionando by this catchword.
In his writing, referred  to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, that revokes the conviction of the doctor Sheppard because of the coverage of the process, and left in clear that would demand that the new means would require new rules.
"This case", wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century".
It can the civismo tend a bridge to join the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign by the invectiva and the negatividad, this week has unchained  a bit of civismo in Washington.
It is a presagio of a genuine cooperation bipartidista future or a moment ilusorio before a fast turn to the fight partidista in the capital?
The meeting of the Tuesday between the president Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any advance in the big subjects that have to be treated during the salient session.
But by what say all, went at least a discussion cortés on the differences of the two parts, as well as a recognition of his responsibilities shared to govern, instead of being another empty episode to win points partidistas.
The public meeting of the Wednesday of the commission of deficit of the president was equally civilised, in spite of the political differences that subsisten between the members.
It seems clear that the narrow interaction during a period of months generated a mutual respect that trasciende the brecha ideological that still separates to the members.
This is hardly sufficient to declare that it has arrived a new was of cooperation.
Now both parts are in a period of proof, sondeándose mutuamente to identify signs of cooperativismo and commitment, while they treat to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed war partidista.
Reason by which the meeting of the Tuesday and the back evaluations of the same by part of the participants did  with a minimum of exigencias or indictments.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and are most deeply rooted as to suggest any fast change of the climate that existed during the last two years.
Already it was that it treat  of taxes, expenses, sanitary assistance or social help, the two parts find  in opposite poles.
Anyway, the election of November has softened the humour in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is not any doubt that the things have changed regarding the way to say the things", said Pete Wehner, a civil servant of the administration of Bush now in the Centre of Ethical and Public Politics.
"They are unavoidable after the elections.
The elections wake up passions adherents, that afterwards extinguish .
This is good".
In some questions, in particular in those that appear in the agenda of the salient session, the Republicans and Democrats do not have another option that find a solution.
The reductions of taxes of Bush win  at the end of year, and anybody is in favour of this.
Both parts want to find a way to preserve some or all the reductions, of permanent or temporary way.
Of the same way, is likely that there is a commitment to expand the subsidios of unemployment, probably because the Republicans can not do think that are in favour of the reductions of taxes for the rich, denying the subsidio of unemployment for the unemployed workers.
After the meeting of the Tuesday in the White House, there is main optimism by a possible deal on these subjects during the salient session, together with the ratification of the new pact of nuclear disarmament START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Institution Brookings, warns that the successful cooperation in the questions apremiantes of the salient session will not drive necessarily to a continuous bipartidismo when the new 112do. Congress gather  in January.
It affirmed, by the contrary, that is very likely and until unavoidable, that begin a period of disagreement.
"After the things that have to do  are carried out, in the short term the psychology revertirá the situation to one of confrontación" affirmed.
Also Wehner expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the civismo can drive to a true cooperation.
"I see the main part of what sucederá between now and 2012 like an essay for the main event of 2012", affirmed.
The reasons have a lot that see with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of Tea Party, that contributed decisively to his creation.
By more consciousness that have the Republican leaders on the dangers to exaggerate his position, know that they have to treat to fulfil his promises of recortar the expenses of the state and cancel the new law of health.
These lines adherents already observe  clearly in the initial reactions in front of the recommendations of the commission of deficit, that include the reform of the code tributario and the increase of some taxes and of the age of retirement, and the cut of expenses.
The copresidentes Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have commissioned  of one of the most difficult works in Washington and, according to his own assessment, have entered by force the question of the deficit in the public agenda of a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish his plan like an official recommendation, and have been struggling to arrive near of this figure.
The main resistance is between the civil servants chosen in the signpost, suggesting that in fiscal questions there is, at least at present, few bases or wish for the commitment.
Galston predice Two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and the ones of the Congress.
The first sucederá the next year in shape of crashes adherents, when the Republicans challenge to Obama on the budget, the taxes and the medical assistance, followed afterwards by a period of main cooperation bipartidaria.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There are considerable proofs that, in spite of the partidismo of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see to the two parties working together.
If the confrontación drives to a dead centre, like sucedió in 1995, then both parties will observe with attention the reaction of the people.
Whoever that consider that it is losing probably will change course and will look for commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
The partidismo and the polarisation at present are main of what were around the middle of the years 1990, and seems to have an ideological gap bigger between Obama and Republicans of the Congress of the that there was between the President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in his moment.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 like the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo that shows  this week can be welcome by a lot of Americans.
But this will require much more effort of part of both sides to find points in common in the questions that still divide them.
An American document filtered portrays to Moscow like the paradise of the corruption
The control of the city is in hands of a "cleptocracia", and leaves a part of the sobornos and money of protection that collects directly to the Kremlin, as it informed in February the American Embassy in Russia.
It informed  that so much the police like the Service of Federal Security handle enormous systems of blackmail, what helps to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow.
They collect money no only of legitimate businesses, but also of criminal groups organised.
Each stratum of the bureaucracy, what the Prime minister Vladimir Putin has designated the "vertical authority", takes his part to measure that the money goes up in the scale.
The note, that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks in his website the Wednesday.
The note bases  in sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov still was mayor of Moscow, and blames it by big part of the corruption.
The President Dmitry Medvedev sacked it in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleaning since.
Luzhkov And his wife, Yelena Baturina, that possesses an important company of construction, have denied systematically the indictments of corruption along the years, and he has won several demands by libelo on such indictments.
In September, when in a channel of Russian television asked him on a documentary that suggested that it was corrupt, affirmed: "it Is a madness, a patraña, a fastidio."
According to the surveys, the Russians believe of overwhelming way that his society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the report of the embassy, and is inaudito that they are the diplomatic of a foreign country those that do this.
"The direct links of the government of the city of Moscow with the criminality have carried to some to call it 'disfuncional', and to affirm that the government works more like a cleptocracia that like a government", affirms the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy of a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and of the mafia that literally means "ceiling" or protection) that traspasa the police, the Federal Service of Security (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Subjects (MVD), and the office of the fiscal, as well as all the sectors of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov Is in the highest".
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are in the second level".
"Finally, the criminal common and the corrupt inspectors are in the lowest level".
"This is an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fill an empty in some areas, because the city does not provide some services".
The report affirms that the SFS collects the money of the biggest companies, and that the police aims to the small trades.
A source, affirmed the report, "explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understand that the best is to achieve the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of the groups of the crime organised) since they no only have more arms, resources and can that the criminal groups, but they also are protected by the law".
"For this reason, the protection against the criminal gangs is not more a priority".
The note observes that, whereas the collection of money is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those that pay are subjects to the arrest.
Those that do not pay quickly find his enclosed businesses by a pretext or another.
Medvedev Has spoken several times on the fight against the corruption, but has confessed that has attained little progress.
The note of the embassy informs on men taking cases, probably full of money in cash, inside the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against the corruption, Medvedev has to trust the burócratas", affirmed Georgy Satarov, director of the group of experts of Indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy".
"He does not belong to a political class, because it no longer exists a political class in Russia".
Without the politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, affirmed, the corruption is unavoidable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that the corruption costs him to Russia more than 300 one thousand million dollars by year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the no governmental organisation Transparency International, the country was classified in the place 154 (the countries are classified of the less to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American Embassy, that did not occur until afternoon at night hour of Moscow, surely will cause discontent inside the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed by the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity so that the Kremlin argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the documents WikiLeaks could be lies and reacted furiously by a disclosure that affirmed that the diplomatic American called it Batman and to Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the subject is that this relates  with our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic politics in this country", affirmed.
"But to be honest with you, do not suspect that this would have done  with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you knows, that was done of a so immoral way".
The veterans of the Jemeres Red forced to enfrentar the past
In a concrete classroom weakly lit, with walls marked and descascaradas, the director of the Secondary School Anlong Veng remembered to the man that had built it, the last leader of the Jemeres Red Ta Mok.
"Here all love to Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and concerned  by his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, of 42 years.
Known like "the Carnicero" by his brutality during the government of the Jemeres Red, the commander keeps on being popular in this remote ex fortress of the Jemeres Red in the northwest of Cambodia, where built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where still live thousands of ex soldered of the organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the Jemeres Red surrendered in front of the government, the loyalty sustained by long is being finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and the reconciliation allowed him to the victims that enfrentaran publicly to the people that had participated in the diet.
In June, the government distributed here a book of text of secondary school that for the first time teachs him the history of the Jemeres Red to the children of his ex soldered.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of an ex member of the Jemeres Red, sentencing to the ex boss of the known centre of torture Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known like Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each one of these events, the anxiety has grown between the veterans of the Jemeres Red of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for the reconciliation and his attempts of reintegrarse to the Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear between the ex Jemeres Red, but can not do at all", affirmed Chhang Youk, director of the Centre of Documentation of Cambodia, an independent organisation that investigates to the diet.
"For them, the life under the Jemeres Red was glorious, but the diet has turned into a symbol of the bad".
"This is generating divisions inside the families".
During the government of the Jemeres Red of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of hambre, illness or excess of work, roughly 1,7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnameses invaded and derrocaron to the government led by Pol Pot, the rests of the diet and his soldiers escaped to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December of 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the war of guerrillas from his bases in the mountains and the selvas of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Veng.
But around the middle of the years 90, after an agreement of peace sponsored by the UN drove to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, big groups of combatientes of the Jemeres Red began to desert to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot Died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by strengths of the government in 1999 in the near Mountains Dangrek.
It died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while it expected the process.
Without the support of his benefactores, the most ancient combatientes of the Jemeres Red fell in the absolute misfortune that it is common in the rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia by the movement.
Although some civil servants of elite of the Jemeres Red conserved his administrative places venues in return to depose his arms, the soldiers rasos keep on being poor agriculturalists and no qualified.
"These people has obtained few profits afterwards of the surrender", affirmed Sok Leang of the Centre for the Justice and the Reconciliation, that offers public forums by all Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the diet".
"They were bred without any concept to do businesses".
Sor Lim, of 55 years, who joined  to the Jemeres Red when it was a teenager in 1974, struggled in the selva near of Anlong Veng before devoting  to the life like agriculturalist of poor rice in 1998.
"The life with the Jemeres Red was well", affirmed.
"Ta Mok Gave him to eat to all".
"But now the life is difficult because we have to autoabastecernos".
The current court of the Jemeres Red also has caused worries here.
At the beginning of the next year, expects  that the court begin to process to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another ex minister of the Jemeres Red.
The mandate of the court is the one to process to the main leaders and to those of main responsibility by the crimes, but has not said if it will pursue cases in addition to these four.
This no served of a lot to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the means has centred  in Im Chaem, of 64 years, who was a boss of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Jemeres Red to finals of the years 1970.
In 2007, she said him to the researchers of the Centre of Documentation of Cambodia that had supervised the construction of the prey of Trapeang Thma, a project in which it thinks  that they have died thousands of workers forced.
During an afternoon bochornosa recent, Im Chaem went back to work in the fields to his house on pilot wooden in a way of earth in the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun launched long shadows on the pasture reseco, Im Chaem rejected to speak of his past in the Jemeres Red.
She affirmed that if the court summoned it would not present .
"Cambodia is in peace and stable", affirmed.
"If there are more processings, there will be war".
The Prime minister Hun Sen, that deserted of the Jemeres Red in 1978, also has warned repeatedly that there will be unsteadiness if the court pursues to more suspects, although the experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and sepultar the past" affirmed.
But enfrentar the past is precisely what Cambodia has to do to advance, said Chhang Youk, of the centre of documentation.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to go back to join the pieces broken" affirmed.
"It is our obligation gather these pieces broken so that we can understand".
The centre produced the first book of text approved by the government on the Jemeres Red, called "To History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June like a supplement to the book of text of history of secondary school of the Ministry of Education, that contains less than four pages on the Jemeres Red.
As in the main part of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng knows few details on the Jemeres Red, in spite of the bond of the city with the diet.
Touch Valeak, of 19 years, a student in the Secondary School of Anlong Veng, said that the new book of text helped to the students to understand an important part of his history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when it carried the book home to study.
"My family refuses a lot of parts of the book of text and the court", affirmed.
"They have suspicions because they are not safe on the quantity of people that will process the court".
Such resistance has done that the process of reconciliation was complex and difficult, affirmed Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the book of text and the court are beginning to produce an impact, affirmed.
Anyway, here the Jemeres Red conserve a powerful charm.
In the Mountains Dangrek, a way with too many bad grasses and covered of stock exchanges of plastic refused drives to a rectangle of the black soot covered by a ceiling oxidado of hojalata.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a montón of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a vendor of cellular to the edge of the way, said that it did not know a lot on the man that was cremado there.
"But he has a strong spirit and a lot of inhabitants of the place go there to pray him", affirmed.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later this day decided to walk until the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where would leave a manojo of mature bananas with the hope to have good luck.
Byelorussia accepts to renounce to his reservation of uranium described for armament
In a surprising victory for the campaign of the president Obama to protect the nuclear material all over the world, the government of Byelorussia announced the Wednesday that will renounce to his reservation of uranium highly enriched, a critical component of the nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a conjoint statement published after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton gathered  with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Byelorussian Sergei Martynov, to the margin of a summit of security.
By years, the American government had been treating to persuade to Byelorussia that it renounced to his highly enriched uranium and seemed that they had arrived to a point without return the past spring.
But the American civil servants said him to the Washington Post that they carried out a pair of operations classified with Byelorussia in the two last months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of uranium described for armament of an installation of Byelorussian investigations.
This prepared the terrain for the agreement of the Wednesday to withdraw the rest of the material, roughly 227 kg, according to a civil servant, that spoke from the anonymity because of the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear Security of 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, that excluded to Byelorussia.
And apparently it was a good attainment ensure the invitation of the ex Soviet republic to the following summit in 2012.
"Really I felt me fascinado by the fact that they wanted a place in the Summit of Nuclear Security of 2012".
"This shows that this process is working", affirmed Ken Luongo, president of the Society for the Global Security, a group that promotes the nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant step and important" die by Byelorussia.
In April of 2009 Obama promised in Prague protect all the vulnerable nuclear material all over the world in the next four years.
Since, the American government has helped to six countries to undo  of all his highly enriched uranium.
Byelorussia would be the seventh.
A dozen of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
In the moment of the Summit of Nuclear Security of Obama, the Byelorussian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation never would renounce to his uranium.
"We have conserved the highly enriched uranium (cientos of kilograms of what is basically uranium described for armament) and the uranium of low enrichment", affirmed Lukashenko in this moment.
"This is our prime matter... We do not go to manufacture dirty bombs, and do not go to sell  them to anybody".
"We use it with ends of investigation, is everything".
However, Byelorussia approached to the United States does some months, indicating interest in achieving an agreement.
The civil servants affirmed that the first task to withdraw the uranium of Byelorussia, in October, went particularly complicated, since the material had been slightly irradiado.
The civil servants said that it was loaded in a special train that travelled more than 2.000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
According to the civil servants, the second operation finalised the Monday and was done in aeroplane.
The American government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and the main part of the money used  to supply him to Byelorussia the installation of investigations with uranium of low enrichment, that is not ideal for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a civil servant of the Department of Energy that works in the Reduction of Global Threat, said that "this was coordinated and orquestado with a lot of care to strengthen the confidence" that drove to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Byelorussia possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium described for armaments, as well as cientos of kilograms of uranium highly enriched.
Byelorussia will treat to delete his reservation to 2012, according to the conjoint statement.
The relations between Byelorussia and the United States have been taut by years, mainly because of the rough repression of Lukashenko of the human rights.
But the statement of the Wednesday suggested a potential distention.
It declared  that "while it receives  with I like the progress in these questions of global security, the United States and Byelorussia recognised that a main respect by the democracy and the human rights in Byelorussia keeps on being a central subject to improve the bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens".
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA with Taliban prisoners and of To the Qaeda with direction to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as it expressed in a telegram the ambassador of U.S. in Madrid.
Like this they reflect it the documents filtered (wires) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where adds  that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández of the Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive was informed to "be able to to show that they exerted an appropriate surveillance on the foreign aeroplanes that cross Spain".
In June of 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in contrary practices to the human rights to a dozen of countries, between them Spain, produced  a meeting between the ex North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of the Vega.
The vice president recognised that the report of the Council "had taken to the Government of Shoemaker out of game" and insisted in that Spain did not have at all that hide in this subject.
"Of the Vega underlined that Spain does not have objections to the flights of intelligence through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid be "pillados desprevenidos", relates Aguirre in a wire.
Also the then title of Outsides, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, signalled to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this subject the lowest profile possible, although, when being in hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
By his part, in January of 2007, the public prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that would not try to block the initiative of the judge to ask the de-rating of the documents of the National Centre of Intelligence (CNI) and of the ministry of Defence on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports do not contain any element incriminatorio neither any sensitive information", explained the Embassy after speaking with the public prosecutor.
However, U.S. reflected his worry by the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German public prosecutors", more than by the information desclasificada of the CNI or of the ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case tactfully between Governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March of 2007 in a breakfast between the ambassador of U.S. and the minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this commented him that "although the Spanish judges are rabiosamente jealous of his independence and will do what consider adapted", he had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoided comments of inflamada rhetorical, in an attempt for recessing the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses his worry by the performance of the PP in this subject.
"In spite of his general orientation proamericana, our experience suggests that the PP will not doubt in capitalising any indication that the Government of Zapatero tolerated or knowingly ignored actions of U.S. that could be interpreted like possible rapes of the human rights, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the Government of U.S.", signals.

The popular would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase of votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PP already has the sight put in the generals then , there is advance or no, the perspectives are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training obtains in these comicios is used to to bend to the that receives in the Catalans.
Like this, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the generals of 2008, whereas in the autonomic of 2006, the figure rose to 316.222.
The past Sunday, the PPC attained 384.091 votes.
To keep  this upward trend, that has nourished  of a trasvase of votes of the PSC and of the fidelización of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, if they celebrated  general elections, the PPC could happen of 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, whereas CiU would win also four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose at all less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would ascertain that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a deputy - now has three - whereas ICV would remain  with a deputy or would win one.
But, to keep  the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will produce  in May of 2011 with the comicios municipal, where the popular also can be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of province and in his relief at the head of the Deputation of Barcelona, one of the administrations that more presupposed handle - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
So much nationalist like popular coincide in the possibility that the PSC lose the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the socialists would not obtain majority neither possibility to resort to his traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican disaster, would not be descabellado that this training lose his representation in the Barcelonan Consistory - needs  obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased his figure of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive strength in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to to star the dump in the capital tarraconense, where governed with the PP before that the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has situated  only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, keeps very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, found  in several occasions.
The popular have grown also in other important municipalities like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to To the Qaida
In addition to the seven arrested persons in Barcelona, in Thailand there was three
The seven paquistaníes and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Commissariat of Information of the Police in Barcelona formed a cell yihadista that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of To the Qaida, between them "The Tigers for the Release of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author this last of the attacks of Bombay that caused the death to 106 people in 2008.
The Home Office has given big importance to these investigations, until the point to ensure that with the "operation Kampai" has remained "weakened" the device of fake of To the Qaida to international level and, "therefore, his operative capacity".
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where were falsified and afterwards distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy To the Qaida so that his "combatientes" can cross the European borders and of other western countries with total impunity.
The cell destamantelada is not the only that the network yihadista had operative in Europe, of here that in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, by what no  descarta that in territory of the EU carry out in the next days similar hits to the developed in the night of the past Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (were detained the paquistaníes Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand developed  another with the capture of the paquistaníes Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were those that directed from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of her was struck in 2009 - stole mainly to tourists passports that fulfilled with the marked requirements by the called "World-wide Islamic Front".
That is to say, the documents had to be to name of men of between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas stamped.
In means of the investigation underlines  that, for the moment, has not found  any data that link to the arrested in Catalonia with the attack of Bombay, in spite of that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", have been one of the groups receptors of the passports stolen in Spain and afterwards falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it fits to remember that days before it was committed this attack, from Catalonia were sent through an agency of transfers some one thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of cards of mobiles that afterwards were used by the members of the "commando" that finished with the life of 106 people.
The Police has confiscated  of abundant documentation.
The PP demands to But that park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had occasion yesterday to expose him personally to Artur But his conditions to support his investiture like president of the Generalitat, identical to the already posed during the campaign and that  summary in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and prescindir of adventures edge-soberanistas, as it is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to pose in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans attended to the meeting of Artur But with the security that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections of the past Sunday, figure more than sufficient to do  want to, as the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the trainings that will exert the opposition abstain  in the vote of investiture.
Of a possible entente with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to keep in the Congress when they celebrate  general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that these days keeps But with the rest of political leaders do  in Catalan key.
And regarding the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it will be necessary to park all the speeches soberanistas and independentistas", as well as the economic concert - similar to the of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader pretends even subject to referendum.
Both leaders yes have in common his bet for thinning the political device of an autonomic administration very inflada and the elimination of the tax of successions and donations.
Of the details of the negotiation on the investiture of But will occupy , by part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But it has gathered  already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - that promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalan).
The geriátrico affirms that the deaths did not go by "fault of measures"
The owners of the centre of Olot no descartan that his celador killed to more than 11 elderly
The managers of the geriátrico The Caritat of Olot (Girona) offered yesterday a press conference to put of relief the damage that has caused him to the institution the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse that while it was there employee killed at least to eleven elderly that had to his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Room, compareció accompanied of the letrado of the centre, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the wish of The Caritat would be can exert the indictment against the manager" of the deaths but "the lawfulness and the responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil managers".
And it is that in addition to the desprestigio social that can suffer the entity by have not detected to time the criminal activities of the celador, the big threat for The Caritat earns now forms of sustanciosa compensation that already are calculating the legal representatives of the familiar of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime traces back to August of 2009 and that since has not left to kill.
The judge already aimed in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - ancient patient of the geriátrico - that suspected that in a lot of cases any doctor explored personally to the died but, attending to the age and to the pathologies of the patients, dismissed  the formality by telephone.
The Caritat, through his director, denied yesterday categorically this extreme and aimed that "the fault of measures can not have been in any moment the cause of what has happened".
The lawyer of The Caritat added that "in the cause there is not an alone indication that there has been an imprudent action by part of any another person that was not the own imputed".
The already baptised like "Angel of the Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed it on 29 August 2009 for, a month and half later, kill to a second grandmother.
In this case it caused the death puncturing him an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that committed it helping of a mix of tablets sedatives.
The director of The Caritat aims that it is complicated to control that the personnel of the centre have access to the medicines.
The pricks of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his afán to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to give them death.
But they will be the analyses that are doing  in the laboratory those that will have to clear if Vila do not mention and looked for for his first victims a less cruel death or if, by the contrary, burned them by inside giving them bleach as it already has confessed that did with the three women that killed between the 12 and on 17 October.
In The Caritat do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the celador, neither so at least to the number of murders confessed, that no descartan that it was upper, and justify his attitude in the different versions that has given Vila in his visits to the court and in the little sense that has to change his way to proceed after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That's why they say that they put  to disposal of the justice for esclarecer the scope of this event.
The ECB looms
The investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday of Trichet that warned "the markets do not have to subestimar our capacity of reaction".
The differentials of peripherals have closed with strength and the actions of the European banks have gone up more than 5%.
Nevertheless, neither we have to subestimar the capacity of the ECB to make a mistake  and the euro hardly has repuntado which is a worrisome signal.
What has produced  yesterday is suitable of a market ilíquido that the same that it collapses  recovers  but motivated by closing of short positions and very speculative.
The institutional investor will take in losing the fear.
It does a month the ECB quoted us today to withdraw measures of liquidity and will have to  retractar morning by fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalise the plan of purchase of public debt by ineffective and delete all the extraordinary measures of liquidity to term and leaving so alone boundless access to week.
After the Irish crisis expect that prorroguen the measures of current liquidity "at least until March" and keep the quarterly auction with boundless access at the end of the quarter to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
Also we expect that they continue with his program of purchase of bonos and even that they give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfil with the expectations generated revertirán the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they follow obcecados in withdrawing measures of liquidity, that God assist us!
To the equal that in his meeting of May in which they affirmed that they did not have neither contemplated the purchase of bonos and collapsed the markets, tomorrow could repeat the history.
The ECB has to be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazuca the Monday and the Wednesday said that it already had bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The alone Treasure issued 500 millions to 5,28%, versus 750 millions to 4,81% of the previous auction.
Still like this the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points in all the curve, reflecting clearly a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, has made public  the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures estimated are some 10.000 millions in the short term and other 15.000 potentials and have until February to achieve private capital or will remain nationalised.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the test of stress, the figures are asumibles inside the Plan of Help and help to reduce the uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to achieve the parliamentary approval of his new budget and still does not have sufficient support, by what Ireland keeps on being a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to relax the tension of face to the next Summit of Heads of state and of Government on 14 December in which it is necessary a political commitment that show that we are a union and that all touch the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch to Wagner and the rest the hymn of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity when presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will approve the Friday the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate the employment sound in hearings of the investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock exchange have gone up 4,5%, the double that the rest of European Stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and of the Bank of Spain has been fast and conclusive and are benefiting us of the effect surprise.
Today there is a key auction of a bono to three years that will see  benefited by the effect Trichet by what expect that it resolve  with strong demand and help to dissipate the doubts on our capacity of refinance.
For Spain ask a Plan of Help would be a autoinmolación.
They would give us a line of liquidity that do not need, the Treasure have more than 40.000 millions in available liquidity the triple that in March, to very expensive types and closes you the access to the markets sine díe.
Nevertheless, the strategy has to keep on being the one of the woman of César, "in addition to being it, seem it".
Spirit, can.
The president of Eulen will impugn the board de Vega Sicilia asked by his children
The storm no amaina in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and The Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will impugn, when considering it "invalid of right plenary", the judicial board of The Enebro of the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will treat to do cost his majority and do with the organs of management of the signature title of Cellars Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in his litigio by the control of part of the group.
The founder of the main holding of business services to the company does not seem had to yield in his litigio to be present in the organs of government of The Enebro.
Of his board of directors was descabalgado by five of his seven children that appointed  administrators in the assembly of shareholders of 18 January of this year and whose impugnation is annotated in the Mercantile Register.
The judicial board of The Enebro for the next day 16, summoned by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the thunders in the breast of the family Álvarez.
The resource to the judge to fix the assembly is, until it resolve  the conflict, the only juridical mechanism that guarantees the announcement of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez like a "desperate resource of the applicants his five children for, by means of argucia procedural, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, treat to validate and sanear the radically invalid board of 18 January", according to his official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the base so that, once celebrated the board, proceed to his impugnation when considering that it is "invalid of right plenary".
The same protagonists, that keep a discreet silence, already tried without success that the magistrate summoned in June a board.
In The Enebro, society patrimonial and title of Cellars Vega Sicilia, amongst other active, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services demands, however, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This subject is the fundamental issue that has to decide the judge once celebrate  the sight on the demand of impugnation, for which still there is not distinguished date.
Network Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in the cars in real time.
Since Network Bull burst into in the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selecto universe of the speed has been marked by the surprise and by the success.
In a first moment anybody took in consideration the options of a escudería recently arrived and, in spite of the ascending path of the last seasons, the past November, in the straight final of the championship all bet by the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without desmerecer the skill like pilot of the finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, neither neither of the capacity of the engine Renault that propulsa his car, in the world of the Formula 1 has turned into a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in hands of Network Bull to turn into it a winning team.
It treats  in reality of a powerful software of simulation of processes that the German put in the market in 2007 with ends very move away of the high car competition.
Designated PLM, this powerful computer instrument has used  to design chains of setting of factories manufactureras all over the world, plants of energy, instruments of high precision.
The aim is to reproduce, simulate of faithful form the product or the process before building it of real way, avoiding of this way failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM Has facilitated the development of the photographic cameras of Canon, of the aeroplanes of Sukhoi or of the cars utilitarios more famous of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in his factory of Formula 1 has allowed to Network Bull design and carry to effect "in few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that detect  during the careers and in the essays.
Russwurm Explains that the escuderías in the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in his team that were able to enter a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during each season.
In the team of Network Bull work today 180 professional youngsters of high qualification that, instrumented with powerful computer teams, analyse and project all luck of modifications in the bólidos.
The director of Siemens explained that to the software PLM is able to analyse and improve all the elements of the bólidos of Network Bull with exception of the engine, that is of the whole responsibility of Renault.
They modify  the materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the elements of security.
The changes can carry  of the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by means of laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As only limitation of this madness of the technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of Formula 1 can spend at most in each season to facilitate the competition.
Network Bull has mounted the factory of high technology to design and produce his bólidos in a location to some 50 kilometres of London.
It treats  of two buildings in which they are restricted the visits, especially for journalists.
All what there becomes is considered "high secret".
The staff for this committed rises to 580 people, included his two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Network Bull, definitely, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the mark of energetic drinks has put to the service of his participation in the circuits, hide  other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and his invalid notoriety.
The boss of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, affirms that five years ago it could affirm  that the advances of R&D in the cars of carts contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were managers of the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the value added.
Nevey Recognises that the Vettel or Webber never will be substituted by the computing since "they are gladiadores impredecibles".
HP Will install in two years 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in collaboration are his partner Pont Kings.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational foresees to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company compatibilizará this initiative with the 16 already present areas in centres multimarca as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Smith, put like example the remodelled shop situated in the Big Barcelonan Road, property of Pont Kings, with the one who collaborates from 30 years ago.
The North American group has prepared a plan to situate 200 points of sale of mark in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first in opening were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the past week, being the one of Barcelona the third.
Smith did not want to desvelar the following possible openings, although it recognised that Madrid could be the following destination.
The also director of HP personal systems ensured that the philosophy to install the shops will be always the same, supporting in a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group aide and commissions  of the design exclusive furniture of the shops (with products that can touch  of interactive form), that in Europe will have an identical image.
Besides, HP covers the training of the personnel of the establishments.
Helena Smith denied that it treated  of a system of franchise and stood out that the exclusive network of trades pretends "to improve the service to the client and to the pymes in the purchase, the attention, the posventa and even the packaging".
The shop of Barcelona includes a space with a pilot program pioneer to world-wide level that commissions  to resolve the possible problems of the computer teams of HP in guarantee.
An on-line service connects with a technical centre situated in Maastricht (Holland).
"Like this, in 10 minutes can solve problems that sometimes can take until two days."
"This system is designed especially for pymes and users, since the big companies already have hired services of technical assistance", remarked yesterday Helena Smith.
Sabadell bets by 'steal' one million clients to his rivals in three More optimistic
years that other directors, the adviser delegated of Bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking, but descarta initially a new crisis of liquidity and vaticina the end of the war of the passive.
In spite of this, foresees a collapse of the margins of interests, that will try  compensate partly with rises of commissions and of the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to attract in three years one million individual clients, his asignatura pending.
Sabadell has found a road to explode the three next years and can like this survive in some economic surroundings very complicated.
The bank will set up in 2011 a new plan director that will have a force of three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without need to resort to the public helps of the FROB, is to win quota of market with the catchment of one million new individual clients -700.000 if they discount  those that can go out of the bank-, his big asignatura pending, since up to now there was spoiled more to the pymes and companies that to the retail client.
This year it has attracted 250.000 individual clients and 50.000 companies.
His quota of market in individuals is of 3,5%, whereas in companies surpasses 10%.
Another of the bases of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet by the productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduction of costs like aim, and whose challenges will expose them the bank when present the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to fix  some aims and make public them since the financial crisis has trastocado all the plans of the world-wide banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his plan director Optima, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets did that it will expand it an exercise more.
The clients that leave to escape the boxes of savings will be his main aim.
In a desayuno organised by the APIE, Guardiola insisted in that 2011 goes to be a difficult "and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Besides, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although it thinks that the war of the passive -that penaliza the margins- is reducing , the price of the premiums of risk that are paying banks and boxes by his broadcasts to obtain liquidity are moving  already to the price of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The subject of the liquidity and the finance is structural, and goes to be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not closed the tap, but the differentials are higher", recognised Guardiola.
Banesto Already gave the Thursday orders to his network so that they limit the credit on a long-term basis and go up the price of the differentials -see CincoDías of the 22 and 27 November-.
Also it recognised that the tendency of the banking now "is to go up commissions", but "there is a competitive frame".
The plan director of Sabadell bases  in the organic growth, although, as always, the group no descarta corporate operations.
No in vain, it ensures that in Spain "go  to require main sizes."
"Next year it goes  to move all", ensured.
It affirms that the needs of capital are "gone up a lot of" and no descarta that some Spanish financial entity go in in red numbers.
And it aims that the FROB can suplir to the market in the catchment of bottoms in front of new recapitalizaciones.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive to the temporary closing of the markets, subtracted importance to what some bankers vaticinan already like a new crisis of liquidity.
It signals that it can not  issue, but on the contrary of what occurred in June, can obtain  finance in the short term through repos, what cushions the crisis.
The CECA descarta a second wave of fusions in the boxes
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, descartó yesterday that it go to produce  a wave of fusions of boxes of savings and went back to insist in the speed with which is executing  the restructuring of the sector.
When it started the process of concentration of the boxes of Spanish savings, were varied the entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that would reserve  for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Boxes of Savings (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, descartó yesterday that this new wave of operations go to produce .
"I think that the biggest part of the fusions has done , the incorporation of Cajasol to the group of Civic Banking can not  say that it was a second round, what there is are adjust."
"The main part is entirely done; it can that in place of 17 go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have done  already and tutelados by the Bank of Spain, that in this has collaborated a lot also", aimed the director.
In statements during a desayuno of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is tackling  "to the main possible speed, and have to be very satisfied of as it goes  producing in the terms that in his day, no now, marked  in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain", enfatizó.
"Happen of 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million volume of active to 17 with 75.500 millions is a process that does not have parangón in the history, reducing the number of entities in 62% so that they are much bigger to fulfil with Basilea", resaltó.
Olavarrieta Recognised that "they exist a series of opinions quite little lucky on the slowness of the process" that show "a fault of seriousness and of sense", because "what does the Bank of Spain is to remember that we have to be inside the term before final of year".
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ensured yesterday that Spain has the financial system more rigorous of all Europe and "probably" of the world, and attributed to those who put it in cloth of trial a "fault of knowledge".
The director aimed that, inside the current coyuntura economic, "can be very calm" with the situation of the financial entities and of the boxes of saving, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "importantísimo" and that "goes to the main possible speed".
Also it remembered that the Spanish banking went out very very stopped of the proofs of stress that realised the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted for keeping  in the euro, but has established the conditions for all the Union.
The tensions in the markets have caused a double governmental answer.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new measures of adjust, from fiscal reductions to the pymes, regulation of private agencies of placing or supresión of the 426 euros of help to unemployed without provision, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Stir and The Prat and of 30% of Lotteries of the State.
By another, the vice president Elena Salgado, with the support of the ex-president Felipe González, has added  to the critics to the chancellor Angela Merkel by his responsibility in desatar the current crisis.
How it is necessary to interpret these movements?
It go by in front that the position of Merkel is not an error in his communicative politics.
By the contrary, is another turn of nut in the difficult process of redesign of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what has to be his future, that bumps with the one to keep the ancient traditions of good part of his partners.
In front of the European resistances, in Germany begins to especularse on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by her same, Austria and Holland, amongst other countries, while the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the frame, although now it seem science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable, near to 50% of the population.
The third, a rediseño of the euro, on line with the proposals germanas of main control macroeconómico, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries transgresores, possible suspensions of payments of any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of adjust them potential.
The German position is clear and comes defining from does time, so now they do not fit excuses.
First, in the 2009, when so much the FMI as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government took out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from the 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that had to do (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in the public finances), and what were practising his European partners, included France.
The second in the front gave it the country centroeuropeo when Merkel lengthened penosamente the decision of rescue of Greece.
Already then it went object of fierce critical, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published were very against of the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, again Merkel surfaces with a clear position, demanding the reform of the treaties of the Union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, force to the private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has interpreted  like antieuropea, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and all the other.
But his proposal, although a so much edulcorada, has approved  and, in the next months, would have to assist to the process of reform of the Union that make possible those measures from the 2013.
Germany has traced a red line that does not think to cross.
And It is saying us to all that, although now it was necessary to take measures with which perhaps is not very of agreement, from that date the ancient operation of the euro, will have finished .
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries offenders will be severely sanctioned, can be forced to declare  in suspension of payments and, in this case, the private sector also will run with part of the cost.
Germany Is signalling us that we have to follow a severe way of growth with high taxes of saving and investment, moderation in the consumption, improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based in the debt and the construction, with enormous holes in the scales of payments, as the one who has chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply do not go it to tolerate.
The envite is clear.
And we would do badly in not to understand it.
It does not treat  only of reconducir the public deficit to 3% in the 2013.
What demand us is much harder.
And the worst that in these circumstances could do is to deceive us to us same.
I expect that the current turbulences leave step to a main tranquility.
And that take advantage of the window of opportunity that have given us, until the spring of the 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero also has understood it like this and his double self-evident (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures) suggests that, in spite of the critics to Merkel, has opened  way the thesis that it is necessary to sort out home.
But the red line that Germany has traced here is, and does not seem that they go it to move.
And, between the possibilities that contemplate , the one to abandon a monetary zone too atiborrada of countries little serious, can not exclude.
Then, Germany always will be able to us say that already it had warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Tretas like the ones of Alonso and Bouquets in front of the Ajax show wit but no will to escape to a sanction.
The expulsion supposedly urdida by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Bouquets) in the party contested on 23 November against the Ajax in the League of Champions has caused that they write  rivers of ink about if such behaviour is or no antideportivo and if, eventualmente, both players had to be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As it is very known, to fault of some minutes to finish the party (that his team already had clearly livestock), the two players lost knowingly time to the hour to take out both faults to cause that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
Of this way, and place that already the Real Madrid will finish like leader of his group, both players will fulfil the statutory sanction the next party of the liguilla, against the Auxerre, and will be able to happen clean of cards to the following phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two parties to the trainer of the team, José Mourinho, and with distinct economic quantities to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of the football.
It is so widespread that forms part of the ethos, of the no written rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate arisen in the case related is due to that it has been starred by a team of the entity of the Real Madrid (that in his hymn boasts of nobility and honour, and that in past occasions has fined to his players by analogous acts) and to the dramatization orquestada, when seeming, by Mourinho, the one who adds an episode more to his dilated history of technician histriónico and provocador.
In any case, the debate turns around if this type of behaviour no forbidden on purpose by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions commits  fraud of law; then , in effect, they are respectful actions with the sportive regulation, but seem to evade his sense.
The question goes through to examine the type of damage that cause to the sportive spirit.
One of the goods that comprises the sportive spirit is the physical integrity of the contrary players, appearance that with these actions did not put  in danger, that is to say, there was not violent game.
Another of these goods to which alludes  with the clean game is to avoid that the team of the players offenders take advantage of  of unfair way of the contrary team, thing that neither occurred.
Now well, the paradoxical of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it did not accommodate  to what usually characterise like cheat or fraud of law, as his rape of the rules did not do  to hid to treat to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action treated to be the most evident for like this receive the punishment of the referee.
They expected and they accepted gustosamente the sanction.
Another question is which type of advantage obtain the offenders in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to ascertain that it does not place  in situation desventajosa to the rival neither obtains  profit in the same party, as obviously the result of the action supposes to leave to the own team with fewer players.
And neither it is an useful strategy for the next party, as the club will not be able to have these players.
The advantage, obviously, consists in that the players will begin the following phase of the League of Champions without cards that can loom his participation in a future party.
But it treats  of an advantage on a long-term basis, with a true degree of indeterminación, as the team can remain deleted at first, and besides with this performance the players fulfil a party of sanction and happen to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards produces  with one less than in the first cycle.
So that, to go happening rounds, is not so clear that it was an advantage.
In definite, these actions do not go against the sportive spirit, of the that yes forms part take strategic decisions that favour to take out the maximum provecho of what allow the rules.
In the supposition that occupies us, the players did not act for evadir the application of the sanction (this yes would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather they chose when subject to her.
They took a strategic decision without sortear the punishment neither escape of the same.
Although the border between the wit and the fraud of law is diffuse, in this occasion think that treated  of a clear case of wit.
The controversy, seems me, arises by two factors: because it treated  of two autoexpulsiones and by the way in that it carried out the transmission of the guideline to cause them.
The damage caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not so much ethical like aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to attract the dinners navideñas of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year a avalancha of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
They proliferate the celebrations autosufragadas by the employees, that want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December also go back the dinners grupales previous to the Christmas, that follow exerting of oxygen cylinder for the restoration and the leisure of Barcelona, but that owing to the crisis have ended in an offensive of prices adjusted to be able to attract to the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or foods, coincide the employers and associations of the sector interviewed.
To finish to complicate the accounting, the calendar of this year (when falling the Nochevieja in Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of 13 December, with the result to date of a avalancha of reservations of dinners for days tip (the 16 and 17) and hardly movement for the previous week.
As it already comes sucediendo from the 2008, when it began the stage of lean cows, are many the companies that have deleted the collective dinners by budgetary question.
For no prescindir of the tradition, a lot of workers keep it paying of his own pocket.
It was cual was the coyuntura, ones and others demand prices of battle, confirms the president of the Gremi of Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronal, to day of today, does not dare to vaticinar how will be the celebrations of this month.
"The people thinks it to him a lot before reserving."
"It wants to go out but it has the alerts lit in the subject of the prices", aims.
The business will go well "to which give quality at good cost and with good service", adds, and remembers that the clients tend to go down a stair with the crisis, so that the band around the 25 euros has turned into majority in the demand.
In a poll in diverse centrical establishments ascertains  the collapse of requests for the night of the 17.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is an authentic boom of applications for this Friday, with the pretence to spend less than 30 euros, to what have answered adapting his menus to the coyuntura, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, The Inn and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has comported more reservation anticipated, even from principles of November.
"We have done the impossible to keep the same prices of the past year, with menus for all the tastes from 19,95 until 30 euros", detail.
In AN Grup, that champions The Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and until a total of 23 venues, keep  optimistic after detecting a peak of the turnover from the second semester and some good, although concentrated, perspectives of business for the Christmas.
Sources of the group stand out that the 18 also will be a day hiperactivo to level of groups of friends that precelebran the parties.
To his six menus of group have added one navideño, with the 30 euros or more like budget crashes and the perception that there is predisposition to spend 10% more than the year happened in return to demand more details, as it digs.
Also they see green shoots in some companies that go back to invite to his employees and feeling that the volume of the groups is something main.
By part of the patronal Fecasarm (that it includes entities like the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and sustains that in group the reservations are "encouraged", although the clients "negotiate to the maximum".
This yes, the illusion by the celebrations has not descended, pay the one who pay, indicates.
The nuclear program paquistaní generates big restlessness in U.S.
Islamabad produces atomic arms to "a faster rhythm that any another country".
The leaks of Wikileaks confirm the bonds between the Talibans and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of U.S. filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous interests that causes in Washington the nuclear program paquistaní.
To the margin of the esclarecedores and substantial details that offer on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in matter of atomic security, instead of going in increase, "decrece", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm that any another country of the world".
The peculiarity of the nuclear program paquistaní - that the arms are not assembled but they remain stored by components to hamper his destruction in case of attack-- constitute one of the main reasons of desvelo in Washington.
Like this it enumerates it the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a previous report to the visit of the then adviser of National Security, James Jones: "The vicinity of some nuclear installations to low territory Taliban attack, the rumoreada dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and in the programs of missiles is contemplated, no already only by U.S., but also by Russia, like proliferante and reason to keep the policeman.
"Pakistan has had to hire personal with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear installations; given the fall of the educational and cultural levels, the extremist organisations have more opportunities to draft to people that work in the nuclear programs or of missiles", said the expert Yuri Korolev, of the Ministry of Russian Outsides, in a meeting with his homologous American.
The newest of the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the every time lower cooperation between U.S. and Pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high rhythm paquistaní of production of nuclear weapons.
A dispatch of the embassy in May, that describes as "frustrante" the communication with Pakistan, sustains: "The transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain without answer or are descartadas".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, ascertains that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster rhythm that any another country of the world".
The ambassador Patterson also asks to Washington, during a visit of the boss of the Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, that leave "very clear" to the responsible that "the Army of Pakistan has to finish with the tacit support to the terrorist groups".
To the hunting of the boss of Wikileaks
Obama appoints to a responsible height of the anti-terrorist fight to avoid new leaks.
Interpol Issues a red alert with the end to follow the movements and locate to Assange where was.
All the related with Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it does not treat  of a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it is not new, but it dates of 20 November.
And it does not have to see with the last leak of more than a chamber of million of diplomatic documents of U.S. but with the indictments of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Besides, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how put in contact with the gentleman Assange".
It was the day 20 when the international police body with headquarters in Lyón (France) dictated the order to application of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving permission of the authorities of this country.
Like this the things, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate to Assange "with seen to his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although the Interpol can not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the countries members, as it has explained the organisation, yes consider the called network notice free road to proceed to an arrest --that it has to tackle the national body of police-, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where thinks that  is Assange.
The movement has indignado to the lawyers of Assange, that yesterday published a letter reporting that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, has showed  had to answer by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They remember also that Assange requested and obtained permission to go out of Sweden of the public prosecutor of his case, to which compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, boss of security of Stalin.
"This seems a hunting, no a legal persecution", reports the misiva.
While the world looks for it -and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son-- Assange is still in paradero unknown, but no quiet.
The Monday conceded from an indeterminate place an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which it asked the resignation of the secretary of State of U.S., Hillary Clinton.
"If it can show  that it was manager to order to diplomatic American that spied in the UN violando international treaties that U.S. has signed, would have to resign", said.
His opinion was denostada yesterday by the secretary of press of the White House, Robert Gibbs, that described as "ridiculous and absurd" the request of resignation.
"I am not of the all safe why has to matter us the opinion of a type with a page web", declared to the chain CNN.
The own Obama has commissioned to a responsible height of the anti-terrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new escapes of documents.
The attempt of the spokesman of the president Barack Obama to subtract importance to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim political and conservative commentators.
Peter King, the congressman that from January will chair the Committee of National Security in the low Camera, has asked to the Department of State that study the possibility to include to Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to take part and his bottoms and pursue to any that them of any contribution or help".
More far still it has gone Tom Flanagan, an aide of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, that has had to retractarse after saying that Assange would have to "be murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into objective and use an aeroplane no tripulado or something".
The one who did not excuse was Mike Huckabee, minister baptista, exgobernador of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"The one who was in the Government the one who filtered the information is guilty of betrayal and anything that was not the execution would be a too kind punishment", declared in the chain Fox.
Puigcercós Looks for the peace in ERC with winks to the affine to Carod
The republican leader will allow to the party a secret vote on his continuity.
Huguet Proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly's system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for sortear the enésima internal uprising in the rows of ERC, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and the half of the votes.
The president of the party is conscious that his threaten of resignation results insufficient for the affine to the exlíder Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is today so diluted like his own mentor and that at all can him cause the quebraderos of head that had with other extinct currents.
Thus, the leader of Esquerra will try to win to the new critics with winks that allow him armour until the municipal elections.
To start with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to pronounce on his continuity secretly.
By means of papeletas, and no manually height.
If the carodistas want vehicular some vote of punishment to the president, will be able to do it without fear to reprisals.
In fact, the boss of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as the one of submission to his person.
In several interviews, affirmed that it would not consider  ratified with the half more one of the votes, but added, without requiring percentages, that neither would be well a result "to the Bulgarian".
The next to Carod demand to the president something more than putting his charge to disposal of the militancia, a gesture that no voucher when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But to the not having of the sufficient majority to force resignations, go to try agree with the executive a leaf of route of here to May.
For this, expect to participate in the preparation of the document of reorientación strategic that the direction will subject to vote of the national council the day 18.
His intention is avalar to Puigcercós in return that this promise to advance the congress to autumn of the 2011, something that the cúpula already takes for granted.
The leader of ERC recognised that the "polyphony" prejudices the stability and that his aim is to do that, once and for all, the organisation was able to wash the dirty cloths of doors to inside.
In this line, results sintomático the article that the conseller in functions Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the headline of Innovació took for granted that the leader will be confirmed "in return of diverse aims".
And it enumerated five, of which stand out two.
The first, "recomponer" the executive so that it represent at least to 90% of the militancia, that is to say, include new faces that come from of the affine sector to Carod.
The second can be the big novelty.
Huguet Proposes that ERC clear of once the asambleísmo like mechanism of operation.
Like this, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allow to celebrate the congresses through delegates chosen by suffrage.
Finish with the assembly's model, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, that already battled in this sense in the two last congresses.
In fact, the convulso cónclave of the 2008 left the commission to the direction to review the asambleísmo in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment follows slope, as the internal tide of the last years desaconsejaba face the subject.
Now, without critical sectors to the threaten, can be a good moment to restart it and try close it for ever.

With literature put the finger in the sore
The second round of The pleasures of the tongue was a walk where the participants did gala of the narración
"This of The sex in the tongue understand it but... The finger in the sore? What expects  of me?", inquirió the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the tongue, cycle that festeja to the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subhead of his question (in another fair the round table devoted  to The sex in the tongue, explained).
The finger in the sore... "It puts us in aprietos", espetó dulcemente the Argentinian writer to the public, mostly of youngsters, that gave  appointment in the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that devoted to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would define afterwards like a big tale, with Luisa in first person like the protagonist that in search of the know which is the "sore", goes of doctor in doctor, of which does not obtain answers although yes tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectólogo goes out convinced: "the patience is not my strong, perhaps was my sore".
At the end, afterwards of a frustrated approach with the traumatologist that has stolen him the breath in half of the corridor, but the one who clears him that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psicoanalista the one who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the sore only attained to know that it is the real opened and that does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the cheats of the tongue have to go very entreverados.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a deleitosa narración that titled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the sore does not appoint  but in a moment discovers .
With pinceladas of magic realism, account of a famous hechicera, that the same touched clouds, brought of turn to men that had gone  far or repaired the virtues that had lost a doncella, narración that viró to speak afterwards America, the big novel to which did not be missing him from the beginning his own chroniclers that explained it and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo the one who criticises the excesses of the explained by the captains conquistadores.
"Cervantes that it invented us to all (the writers) did mockery of the witnesses fingidos that appeared in the histories presented like real, but of another way never had arrived  to explain the history of America with imagination to which was missing him until the modesty".
However, it stood out "they are the crazy and the embusteros those that better imagine" and is where converges reality and lie, where no longer knows  that of the told belongs to an edict or to another, where the literature of fiction achieves his apogeo.
It calls it in fact the "tradition cervantina'.
"By his inheritance are what explains ".
In his turn, the writer Mayra Montero limited and applauded the variety of interpretations to that gave place the invitation of the FIL with his round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-puertorriqueña aimed his to the big sore of the social violence that crosses his country -and shares Latin America- product of the disputes of the traffic and sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, the good poetry, the good songs shut a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditado", indicated, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that establishes  between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this last.
The night closed it the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also did emphasis "of this finger in the sore of the committed writer of the writer".
It considered that in a world that lives to haste, also in the intellectual habits and control of the consciousnesses that redunda in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small himself".
"To be owners of our thought and be owners of the reality have to matizar: and matizar means many times put the finger in the sore and bother to those people that are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in ideas established and without nuance and bother also to the powers that prefer a world in black and white", said, inviting to recobrar the sense to write.
Romano goes by his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, has had altibajos in his career, but has known to achieve already in three occasions the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, besides  enfrentan two different styles marked by his technicians, those who find between yes with a marked contrast by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, has had altibajos in his career, but has known to achieve already in three occasions the decisive series, although up to now it has gone  in white and that's why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian has finished comforting with the medal of the subcampeón, has remained  a step backwards of the winners and interestingly with a same team has played consecutive finals.
The strategist santista arrived to his first final like trainer in the Tournament Opening 2002, when it carried the reins of the Morelia with which fell by global of 4-2 in front of Toluca; later, in the Closure 2003 also arrived to the decisive duel and also lost it with global of 3-1 and went precisely in front of Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Tournament Bicentenario 2010, again in front of the Devils, Rubén went back to suffer a reverse, since his team finished empatado 2-2 in front of the choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the batch of pénaltis put  in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the somersault 4-3.
Rubén already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore it does not want to run the same luck, looks for to give off of the maleficio and can festejar by first occasion a title, although it affirms that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, do not want to break any statistics, this is by a club, by some fans to which I owe me and by consequence will come the title for my, but the previous is the most important", commented the timonel when it questioned it to him about the numbers that has against playing final.
Very valid has the previous final, of which, ensures, has learnt a lot, "the only education that can have is that until the referee whistle the end can not festejar, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penal for throwing already were prepared to go out running and think that this is an education, until it do not finish  the party can festejar".
Know that this series could define in penal shots, something that does not upset him, as it trusts his players: "One never looks for to arrive to the batch of penal, one looks for to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is not of another and it is necessary to be ready, in the previous tournament were prepared, unfortunately did us a bad played the destination, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety to have the title in the hands, but was us , this left us something for this final that expect do not arrive to this instance".
Romano has in his hands leave to be a technician subcampeón and test for the first time the glory that give the titles.

"That no by agreements cupulares, leave  by out to 5 that probably go to do 9 deputies, ahorita to the five that see us, separated in different fractions, have decided to unify us to look for a place in the table of negotiation, that is the subject that in the reform that they did that they agreed, are was and we do not agree with this reform".

It will be able to struggle against the migration clandestina without problems
The project of law of the conservative that, according to the Government, would have to solve the problem of the pateras loaded of migrantes clandestinos, surely  enfrentará to a big opposition, since the three parties of the opposition have announced the Wednesday that could not support it.
"I base me mainly in the Letter."
"I find me here with a party that has created the granite that step", declared the liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded of the deputies after the celebration of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberal defend that the project of law in his current form, that would allow to detain until a year to any person that proceed of a fuselage identified like transport of immigrants clandestinos, infringe the Canadian Letter of rights and freedoms.
The leader of the Block of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, indicated likewise that it could not back the project of law because it aims to the mistaken white.
"We are against and, seemingly, all the parties of the opposition are against of the project, so we already will see what does the Government", declared the gentleman Duceppe.
The critic of the NPD in matter of immigration, Olivia Chow, has refused at one stroke the critics that signal that his party is not the sufficiently firm with the immigrants clandestinos.
"The neodemócratas agree in that they adopt  measured against the attendants of the pateras of clandestinos and this is what pretend with another project of law, the C-35", signals the lady Chow.
"We do not support the project of law of the conservative because it attacks to the refugees and imprisons to the boys during a minimum of a year", explains the lady Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused to the parties of the position to play to politicians and to do case omiso of the will of the Canadians.
"The big majority of the Canadians says to the deputies that do not tolerate this type of migration clandestina, these criminal operations against Canada and that treat to the country as if it was a felpudo."
"They expect that Canada adopt some firm measures", thinks the Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on his project of law, what could carry to the country to some elections like consequence of his rejection.
Nevertheless, a conservative has communicated to the Agency QMI that the Government went to request the celebration of a vote so that each deputy that go to oponerse explain  afterwards in front of his constituents.
The new unit does not achieve the unanimity
Although it had announced  the possible creation of a permanent unit of fight against the corruption and the colusión by Jean Charest, numerous observers follow asking the establishment of a commission of public query on the question.
The Minister of the public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not posed  two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York is question from January of the past year.
The metropoles possesses a permanent unit against the corruption from 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of the Tuesday has pillado by surprise to more than one.
It fits to say that, during a meeting of the permanent Council on the police services of Quebec celebrated the past 29 October, never debated  this measure in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
This was sufficient so that the critic of the party quebequense that treats the question of the public security, Stéphane Bergeron, described this announcement like "a rabbit taken out of the basket" and like "an amateurish solution of last hour".
The Minister Dutil, by his part, has answered to those who fear that the political power have too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the results when we announce it", indicates simply.
"We are conscious of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is not at all that it can substitute the launching of a public survey.
"What more  obstina the gentleman Charest in avoiding the creation of this commission of investigation, more people shares our opinion, that is to say, that has something that hide", explains.
"The only way to have of a commission of investigation is with the resignation of Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethical and gobernanza of the national School of public administration.
To go out of this dead centre, suggests to Quebec that concede a special mandate to the interventor general so that it realise a survey on the colusión and the corruption.
"We have to be able to expand the mandate of the interventor general", concludes.
Likewise, it considers that Quebec could award to the interventor the same competitions that to a commissioner, allowing him like this force to the people to testificar.
The creation of a permanent group is not the only project in ciernes in the Government Charest.
Quebec Requests likewise to Ottawa that modify the penal Code so that it adapt  better to this type of crime.
This application seems to proceed of the fiscal of the operation Marteau, that has informed to the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigations.
The federal Minister of the public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed by his part that his homologous of Justice, Rob Nicholson, bends  at present for realising some amendments in relation with this subject.
During the operation Spring 2001 related with the groups of moteros, although it had not adapted  the penal Code, were detained 131 people.
Later, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Law on the gangsterismo.

The sectors situated north of the river and in the valley of the Outaouais were the most affected.
They could receive until a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
Since these precipitations add  to the thaw of the snow that already had accumulated  in determinate sectors, fears  that diverse rivers  desborden.
The Wednesday at night, the unit of civil Security of Quebec issued alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The north rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, already have caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, the strong precipitations have caused that  desbordasen some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-of-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rains have dragged a provisional bridge.

They blame partially to Dupont
The presenter of radius of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a true reverse in front of the Canadian Council of the norms of the radiotelevisión (CCNR) by some controversial statements in relation with the social assistance and on the Haitians, as well as by his earthy language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that the gentleman Dupont and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express his opinion, but determinate statements contained "inaccurate information on the social assistance, a representation indebidamente refusal of the Haitians and earthy language that would not have to use in the broadcasts spread during the day".
The Council has indicated likewise that the debates on the suicide, including the divulging of the name of two people that had  suicidado, no infringen the codes on the broadcast.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation with the comments done in broadcasts spread between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision issued  after a complaint of the common Front of people that receive social assistance of Quebec.
The group complained that the cuantías mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
The presenters have to communicate reliable data and no that they drive to deception.
In relation with the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had manifested that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Committee have arrived to the conclusion that the message transmitted was that it would not have to consider the suicide like a solution to the problems of the life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes put in entredicho of "Dupont him midi" have treated a delicate subject of a way equitativo and suitable."
Therefore, to this respecto has refused  any fault.
The last litigio referred  to the statements realised after the earthquake of Haiti.
In that moment, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred a clash mediático that had aroused numerous reactions.
The presenter of CHOI declared that it had not realised any donation to help to the Haitians because it could not know with security if the needy went to receive really the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that his effect acumulativo constitutes a representation indebidamente refusal of the Haitians.
"Already I have fulfilled my suspension of three days up there."
"My file is clean from does a year and half", declared the presenter.
In all the decisions, the Committee reports the broadcast of earthy language.
In any case, the chain of radius CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than the required".
The consequences will be minimum for the emisora, that will owe, between other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of main audience in a term of three days.
A king of the kung-fu in Montreal
The montrealés of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, that stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, goes up to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I began to practise martial arts like the kung-fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria", explained Zemmal, that lives in the metropoles from 2008 to advance in the professional level.
"In my case, look for fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy with the game on the soil that involve the mixed martial arts, exist few competitions in North America".
The athlete, that works like agent of security and like employee of the company UPS, has given recently bad news to his rivals, winning two medals of gold in the Championship of the amateur World of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), celebrated of the 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.

"At present I prepare me to participate in the Glass of the World of saint shou in China".
"They will invite to the sportsmen that have finished between the four first places in the last championship of the world in each category".
"In 2009, I won the medal of bronze in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, finished in eighth place".
"In 2007, in China, finalised the tournament in fifth place, but achieved the third place in Toronto in 2009", added.
"The interesting is that I have gone progressing in each competition".
"To this step, will be the first this time or next year!"
The "saint " shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originaria of China in which it allows  strike with the fists and the feet, as well as launch to the opponents to the soil.
The clashes originariamente celebrate  on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The pugilista more famous in this type of fight is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Him, widely recognised in the world of the martial arts.
Although Be born Zemmal so alone has to keep a competition in his career, definitely will attend to the big tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the kung-fu.

"It is like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the main stadium of Thailand) ".
"It has been an incredible experience".
Zemmal Has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who has won me is a true professional", thinks.
"There are four competitors by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals  enfrentan in the final of his category".
"To continuation, the champions of each category  enfrentan to top to an only champion, the king of the kung-fu".
450 millions in agreements without biddings
Hydro-Québec has conceded direct agreements by a value of 450 million dollars to companies of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-To-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the centre of this avalancha of more than one hundred agreements finds  a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, that has obtained without a previous bidding the most important agreement, the one of management of the project, by a sum of 295 millions.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision of Hydro-Québec to trust to the private sector his responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5.000 million dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium Énergie gérance obtained the yielding agreement without that realised  previously a public bidding.
For the Party quebequense, the resource to consortiums of companies poses a grave ethical problem that looms with deleting the competition and cause a rise of the prices.
"It treats  of a new method of colusión and to delete the competition".
"That is to say, the people, in place to do it secretly, now do it openly", declared yesterday the deputy of the Party quebequense Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, the gentleman Simard posed the question in the national Assembly because, as it affirms, does not understand how can benefit  to the public interest in this way.
The Minister of natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, answered in the afternoon, denying firmly that it have produced  a colusión with this agreement.
"I begin to tire me", protested, defending that the PQ had acted of dishonest "way" and "with fault of rigour".
It signalled that "the minimum" would be that the PQ excused.
The formula of the consortiums is a common practice in the whole world.
Usually, it treats  of an alliance with a temporary limit that allows to two or several companies group his knowledges to answer to a bidding for a complex project.
The project Eastmain presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works already have begun and will last until 2012.
In all the case, the agreement has conceded  without that it went in at stake the competition; it has treated  of a negotiation.
Besides, the formula of the consortiums has left to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for projects relatively simple.
Such as it published the past week Him Devoir, the formula of the consortiums in the sector of the technical advice is being subjected to an investigation in the Government.
A fast glimpse to the mercantile register of Quebec allows to identify more than 200 consortiums, of which some seem permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in association with the majority of his main competitors, like PEAK+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and exist tens of them, drives to an only legal person, that is to say, Dessau.
Regarding the consortium Énergie gérance, the Minister Normandeau has stood out that "the territory of the Bay James answers to a hand-held dynamics of particular work and Hydro-Québec answers specifically to her from the years 1970".
The big boss of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie of the Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has stood out the fact that the agreement of management of the project has conceded  of direct form.
"If you answer to a bidding and there are few participants, your prices go to be higher".
"You have two options: you can go in in contact with the actors of the sector and say them: we go to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price".
"Nevertheless, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people", signalled the gentleman Laporte.
The agreement conceded to the consortium Énergie gérance forms part of a long list of agreements of more than 50.000 dollars obtained by the Party quebequense.
The agreements were conceded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-To-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After the comprobación, Him Devoir has identified 109 agreements of technical advice conceded between the year 2002 and March of 2010 to companies or to his subsidiaries, in particular laboratories geotécnicos.
SNC-Lavalin Has obtained 22 agreements, Génivar achieved 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account his participation in Énergie gérance.
All the agreements were negotiated.
In total, rise to 449.783.344 dollars, included the agreement of Énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has given to understand that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good known of the liberal Party of Quebec".
The Minister Normandeau has left to fall that the PQ also is linked to these companies, that fund "it", before requiring that it treats  rather of his leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption. The green "label" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer quebequense hardly trusts the actors of the sustainable development, as well as in the marks of just trade neither in the ecological certificates to guide his elections.
According to the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results have published  yesterday, the situation is still worse. The consumer is submerged in a universe mediático by where pululan messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the fault of reliable information and considers that this even brakes his commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of the products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the quebequenses seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies neither in the advertising environmentalists of the same, reveals the tool of measurement elaborated by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: the half of the consumers puts in doubt the reliability of the official certificates that carry the products called just, as well as the credibility of the products and marks that carry labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsables", signals the Barometer.
Of the same way, so only 14,6% of the quebequenses take  seriously the speeches of the politicians on this question.
Anyway, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of the consumption, sustentado at present by near of a third of the consumers quebequenses.
In fact, the lagunas and the doubtful character of the information do that 46% of the consumers refuse this option.
It treats  of the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the most elevated price of these products.
Besides, a third of the quebequenses say desconfiar also of the supposed performances of the products or ecological services that tries them  sell.
On the other hand, practically the half of the consumers changed his habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the mark of one or several products to respect his convicciones.
61% has given priority to the shopping in the shops of his neighbourhood and has preferred to buy alimentary products cultivated in his region, signals the Barometer.
Greener and responsible (the index of the responsible consumption has achieved 64 points on a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec adores to occupy the place of the king of the recycling that tries to reduce his impact on the environment concerning by the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seem to be of doors (of his car) outside: in 2010, so alone 28% of the quebequenses indicated that it have used the public transport or have shared car to defend his principles environmentalists.

A loan so that the State recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to the that have asked that it engage  financially in the recovery of the complex of cinemas eXcentris pos the Société Angus and the Parallèle, accepts to collaborate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société of développement Angus and the Parallèle, that expected a donation of seven million dollars of the Ministry of culture to go back to buy to Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris in the boulevard Saint-Laurent and give him back his true vocation cinéfila, have not obtained what asked.
The Government has accepted to involve in the subject, but in his own conditions.
In place of the donation expected, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose cuantía would be, in fact, inferior to the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution in advantageous conditions, at least in opinion of determinate public employees.
Quebec Already had refused the past spring a first plan of action and an application of 12,8 millions, but since the applications have reviewed  to the drop.
The president of the Société of développement give entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, that leads the file of eXcentris, remitted a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister St-Pierre.
It has remitted him a last report does a ten of days.
Nevertheless, the SODEC received a contrapropuesta of the cabinet the Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have of term until 31 December to answer to the same.
Anyway, it seems that it has to refuse entirely the hypothesis of a donation of the State.
We remember that the Association of owners of rooms of cinema and cinematographic complexes of Quebec  oponía to a direct investment of the State to back the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of culture does not have to fund projects inmobiliarios, since it has not done it with other rooms of cinema.
On the other hand, diverse representatives of the sector yes demand a considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried during ten years the load of the cinema of author in his venues of the complex, after funding his own construction, what could justify a derogation by part of the Council of the Treasure.
The fault of rooms for independent films results patent in Montreal and eXcentris had known fidelizar to his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, promote by his part a campaign of finance privately, expecting gather 700.000 dollars to open  way to the acquisition.
From spring of 2009, so only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, follows projecting films in eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms the next 27 February, projecting the lovely film of Xavier Beauvois "Give hommes et give dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not gone back to put  in contact with Him Devoir and do not know what think he and his group of the proposals to the drop that have received.
It raises  the veil of the Canada given complex...
The new diplomatic wires American spread by WikiLeaks desvelan what the United States consider like the complex of the Canadians regarding the Americans, but reflect at the same time the feeling of superiority of these last to Canada.
The diplomatic American surprise  that the Canadian constituents do not think in the relations Canada-United States when they go to vote and think that the visit of the president Obama has helped to the conservative government to achieve that it approved  his budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American embassy of Ottawa and of Washington that have made public  yesterday, offer rather substantial details that content really substantial.
A wire of 22 September 2008, that is to say, during full federal electoral campaign, relates until which point the United States do not go in in the questions debated by the political leaders.
This caused big surprise to the American ambassador envoy to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
The gentleman Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders see  conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent to the Canadians to the hour to treat the daily domestic questions, instead of leaving such election to the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade of 1988) ", writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresente, but potentially too dangerous to speak of him."
The ambassador has still more problems in understanding this "silence ensordecedor" because the two countries keep some intense political relations and economic.
"Logically, it thinks, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and, still more, of the boss of a party to manage these essential relations would have to be a key factor in which they would have to think the constituents to the hour to vote."
Can observe  this feeling of importance also the wire sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, commissioned of businesses in Ottawa, to prepare to the president Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will contribute to guarantee the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by means of which Canada will register for the first time deficit in the last decenio because of a plan of recovery of between 30.000 and 40.000 million dollars", writes the gentleman Breese.
In any side does  quotation that the government had to prorrogar the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that it substituted him the coalition neither that the parties of the opposition conditioned his survival to the quality of the plan of recovery proposed.
Another communication of January of 2008 signed by the ambassador Wilkins alert to Washington on the increasingly negative image that transmit the dramatic series spread in the CBC of United States.
To the ambassador concerns him the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2Or, in which they realise  references little subtle to Maher Plough, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings so that the CIA realise forceful interrogations.
Another wire explains that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked to his homologous French Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be had to receive to some prisoners of Guantánamo.
The gentleman Kouchner answered that yes, but that depended "of each case".
At the end of the meeting, wrote "has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation with Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary accepted to review the file".
Finally, we can mention that they have heated  the spirits in relation with the place WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, ancient adviser very near to Stephen Harper, declared in the radio of CBC that the manager of this massive escape would have to be "murdered".
In United States do  echo of Mike Huckabee.
A world-wide plan to renew the illumination
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan of renewal of the domestic illumination, commercial and industrial in one hundred countries to reduce the gases of effect invernadero (GEI) in a quantity that corresponds practically to a third of the additional decrease that has to carry out to stabilise the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan frames  in the group of big concrete projects that the UN expects that it adopt  in Cancún to compensate the fault of commitments vinculantes of reduction in the countries industrialised.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the light bulbs incandescentes, that still monopolise between the 50 and 70% of the market, substituted  by light bulbs fluocompactas or, still better, by light bulbs of diodes electroluminescentes (OF THE or "LED" in English), would avoid  big part of the 1.800 million tonnes (Gt) of GEI issued in the planet to light to the humans.
The illumination is responsible of 8% of the world-wide broadcasts.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the broadcasts of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, the past year, the big countries emisores, like the United States, China, Europe and others, included Canada, engaged  with some plans of voluntary reduction that had to diminish the global broadcasts of GEI of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, they would have to diminish still 5 Gt of said quantity to stabilise, before 2020, the increase of the temperatures in two degrees centígrados to avoid that  descontrole.
In the light bulbs incandescentes, 95% of the energy dissipates  in shape of heat and the rest, that is to say, 5%, produces light.
In the case of the light bulbs fluocompactas, the expense of energy reduces  in 75% and with the new light bulbs LED, reduces  still twice more the energetic consumption.
The light bulbs fluocompactas last an average of between 6.000 and 10.000 hours.
The new light bulbs LED, as those that has launched the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that, besides, has participated in the study of the UN), possess a hope of life of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less than energy that a light bulb incandescente, what allows us do us an idea of the saving that can achieve  with the plan of replacement that would apply  in one hundred countries.
These new light bulbs also can work with reóstatos and issue very little heat.
By on, they do not contain at all of mercury.
Diverse specialists have manifested his reservations in relation with the light bulbs fluocompactas, since they contain mercury and that they have to delete like dangerous waste, which no always is possible in the developing countries, except that the manufacturers place instructions.
However, it indicates the report, the main source of broadcast of mercury in the planet are not the light bulbs fluocompactas, but the thermal head offices of coal, that issue a big quantity of mercury to produce the electricity that squanders  with the light bulbs incandescentes.
Only in United States, said central issue 25.000 tonnes of mercury to the year.
The report details the advantages that would offer this international program to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save  in this way one thousand million dollars to the year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, that is to say, the equivalent to 3,5 thermal head offices whose construction would cost him 2.500 millions.
Ivory Coast expects anxiously the announcement of the electoral results
The Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate "publication" of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, since they have expired the terms fixed.
"The Secretary General stands out the need that the independent electoral commission complete his work and announce the provisional results immediately", resalta a spokesman of the boss of the UN.
"It asks to all the parties of Ivory Coast and to the institutions that show his sense of the responsibility and abstain  of any initiative until they announce  the provisional results."
In spite of the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left that it happen the deadline of the Wednesday to midnight without that published  the results, three days from the scrutiny of the Sunday.
Around forty minutes before the ending of the term, the president of the CEI had commented to the television that the commission "followed working" to announce the results.
The Wednesday have multiplied  in the world the requests that the CEI proclaim finally the name of the victorious of the second turn between the salient Laurent Gbagbo and his opositor Alassane Ouattara.
However, the edict of Gbagbo has the cancellation by part of the constitutional Council of the fraudulent "votes" in the north, in hands of the ancient rebellion of the new Strengths (FN) from the coup d'état fallido of September of 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Ivory Coast, has affirmed that the manoeuvres of intimidation of the constituents realised by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the salient president to go to vote.
All the election could remain cancelled if the constitutional Council accepts the complaints presented by Gbagbo.
Now well, the opponents of Gbagbo consider that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a near political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a north man that denies any relation with the ancient rebellious, has judged of "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and has asked to Gbagbo that respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim the victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that it has lost and that present a complaint in front of the constitutional Council after having prevented that the electoral commission the diffusion of the results, would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidential, the Sunday, had to have put the guinda to the process of reunificación and of reconciliation of a country divided in two from does years.
The United Nations have warned the Wednesday to the political class of Ivory Coast that they could be considered responsible of possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first turn, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes in front of 32% of Alassane Ouattara, that received publicly the support of the ancient president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first turn).

Subject Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated the mediación of Siria
Durante more than ten months, between July of 2009 and May of 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested person in Iran by "espionage", has had in vilo to the public in France, has alerted to the diplomacy and has stressed the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the attentive look of the diplomatic of United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown appearances of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained his strategy to the Americans until the point to give them councils to manage his own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
They show how the French managers tried to convince to Washington that the release of the French youngster did not produce  in exchange by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested person in France and looked for by the American justice by traffics of materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the raw reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate to the media to give the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar To the-Assad, had exerted an essential function in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it did not do at all.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris carries the title "Iran: French comments on the way to manage the cases of taking of hostages".
The adviser of Eliseo for strategic subjects, François Richier, accompanied of the director of the Quai d'Orsay for the north of Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, converse with the diplomatic American Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain him the French method.
They advise to the Americans that do the following for repatriar to his own citizens retained by force in Iran.
"Do noise", say, "soltad continuously" in the media the right "words fundamental humans", "innocence", "immediate release".
Everything to embarrass the Iranian diet, accurate of his image.
"When the Iranian ask you that you stop, do it more frequently still".
Because, once exhausted the attempts of negotiation by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve at all", the Iranian are "expert in dilatory manoeuvres".
The gentleman Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an usual Iranian tactics: the taking of hostages for the political blackmail".
It announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (that it will produce  on 16 August, day in that it will take refuge in the embassy of France) "will require the credit to the Iranian of a big quantity of money" (230.000 euros of reward).
Besides, it signals that Eliseo anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "goes to increase".
The Iranian could "in the near future detain to another of the near of 1.800 French citizens that live in Iran", affirms.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss goes out of prison after twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
It spreads  the following information: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request the United States by illicit traffic of delicate electronic material to Iran, has been put in freedom in Paris by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, to the equal that numerous observers, doubt of this odd coincidence.
For Washington, that near the networks clandestinas Iranian of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand constitutes a bad news.
It has accepted France an exchange?
Free to the Iranian in return of the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier guarantees that it did not go like this.
Eliseo, affirms, no only "has surprised  enormously by the decision of the judge", but it has tried oponerse to the same.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (in the period, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can not cancel the judicial" decision, comments.
The gentleman Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand follows under the "narrow" surveillance of the services of French information.
The adviser of Eliseo marks a number of telephone, hangs and, afterwards, informs to the diplomatic American that the Iranian "finds  at present in some buildings of Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo no escatima in efforts, uses communiqués and "escapes" organised in the media to do think that the Syrian president Bachar To the-Assad exerts an important "and" influential "paper" of "mediador".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that the manipulation brings his fruits, since several articles of press transmit the French official version.
A telegram with date of 25 August 2009 mentions "the 'blitz' mediático of the French civil servants".
To what owes  such "gratitud" to the gentleman Assad, asks  the embassy in Paris.
"In spite of his full statements of alabanzas, the French civil servants recognise privately that so only have an idea wanders of what have done really the Syrians".
To continuation, the document treats the reasons that have carried to Eliseo to give foot to this fiction.
The big effort of communication "has by object validate the politics of Sarkozy opening to Syria", thinks.
A politics initiated in 2008, that "in opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, finished to be lined of premature and desmerecida".
When "exaggerating the Syrian paper", Paris tries "to show to Syria the praises that can harvest if it exerts a constructive paper in the region".
The aim also consists in "seeding the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it of good source.
On 11 August, François Richier trusts him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done something or no."
"But anyway, we have appreciated it to him."
"At least, this would have to cause confusion between the Iranian".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a communiqué, appreciates to the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syrian that have exerted a "active paper in favour of the release of our compatriot".
From midnight, the Korean youngsters can not play on line
The Government surcoreano goes to adopt a law called "of Cenicienta" that will prevent to the teenagers participate in games on line after the half night blocking his access, as they have indicated governmental managers.
In December will subject  a project of law to the Parliament to ask to the companies of games on line that they block the access to said games after midnight to the youngsters of less than 16 years, as they have indicated representatives of the Ministries of culture and of Family.
"A lot of boys play all night and, afterwards, results them difficult study in the school and carry a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect his health and his right to the dream", declared the AFP Jo Rin, ministerial manager attendant of the project of law.
The games on line will be again available to the six of the morning.
The companies will have of a year to prepare  for the application of the law, precise.
The government poses  likewise ask to the companies that limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the youngsters like this request it, added the manager.
Besides, it goes to put to disposal of the one who request it free computer programs that allow to limit the time of connection to Internet.
South Korea is one of the most connected countries "" and the newspapers give news regularly on diverse facts linked to an intensive use of Internet.
The country is likewise the indisputable champion of the world-wide competitions of games on line.
In November, South Korea obtained four medals of gold in the World Cyber Games, where  enfrentó to other 58 countries.
World-wide 2018-2022: the FIFA designates to the countries organisers
In the middle of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the FIFA designates the Thursday to the countries organisers of the Glasses of the world of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political election where the fights of influence and the lobbying can arrive to prevail on the technical criteria.
A thing is clear, the edition of 2018 of the competition of the FIFA will celebrate  in Europe, bastión traditional of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Low Countries-Belgium).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, since the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a première in the African continent in 2010, or continue with his implantation in the United States or in the Far Orient (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that formed part of the delegations (David Cameron, the prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian heads of government and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic interests and politicians that are at stake in a World-wide.
The transactions between frames, therefore, is possible that last until the last minute.
By the other, results difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the report of evaluation of the FIFA, the English candidatures, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) possess better arguments that his competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too weight for the 22 members of the executive committee to the hour to vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible of the disclosures that drove to the suspension by corruption of two members of the CE (Reynald Temarii and Masters Adamu), could have ruined like this the opportunities of his country, cradle of the football, that so only received the World-wide once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire the Monday when spreading a documentary that has put in evidence to three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient to upset to the FIFA and embarrass to the English managers, that have launched  to a lobbying intense in the last weeks with David Cameron in command.
The Head of government expects to reedit the hit given successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, that had achieved in 2005 for London the organisation of the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, will be sufficient to recover the shine of England in front of the CE?
It is not clear, since the duet Spain-Portugal explains also with numerous strong points thanks to his stadiums, already smart, his experience (World-wide of the 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Glass of Europe in 2004 in Portugal) and his culture futbolística.
However, the shady economic perspectives and financial of both countries could throw down his ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts on the solvencia of Spain and Portugal the only that achieve is to give points to Russia, turned into a outsider of weight in spite of the lagunas in his candidature (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, the Prime minister Vladimir Putin decided to not to displace to Zurich and has reported a "disloyal competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the indictments of the English press against the members of the CE.
"They are taking out to relucir his dirty cloths, trying engage them", affirmed Putin.
For 2022, the United States, that have of the experience of 1994, seem the most logical favourites.
First world-wide economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to carry him advantage to Japan and to South Korea, that have developed separately an excellent project.
Nevertheless, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that have organised together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the World-wide 2026 to China, fervientemente wished by the FIFA, that would cause that Asia remained  without possibilities for 2022.
Beside Qatar, that has presented his project basing in futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the FIFA would continue with his expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks that certainties.
Australia, to the equal that Japan and Korea, also could see prejudiced by the weakness of the rights of TV paid (in function of the time difference) by the European countries, the dorsal spine of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: the proof
Of Gaulle really had doubted.
Mitterrand had given to understand that it doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have neither the lower doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
A mandate in Eliseo carries to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will go back to be candidate in 2012.
Nevertheless, the proofs of this do not combine well with the mystery that is used to to associate to the presidential function.
Therefore, always it is necessary to look that it doubts .
To a side and to the another.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac affirmed that no descartaba a third mandate.
On 15 November, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would take his decision "sometime in autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it treat with the deputies of the UMP, the Tuesday at night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some stir.
It treats  of the official announcement of his candidature?
Neither much less.
The so alone president indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited to two the number of mandates of five years.
Simply it transmitted the facts, no an announcement.
It is not the first time that speaks of the presidential, with a tone jocoso, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, still will happen seven years and half with me", there was soltado in July of 2009.
In another occasion, in May of 2010: "you do not think that I do not pose me what will come afterwards."
His affirmations of the day before yesterday do not approach him more to the candidature, neither neither less.
They arouse comments by two reasons.
The acceleration of the career by the candidature in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal have gone up to the palestra what carries to Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerarse.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that his candidature in 2012 result evident is what carries to a lot of people of the PS to demand that it organise  the battle before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, the constituents of right prefer the candidature of François Fillon to the one of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% in front of 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is not any discussion on the subject", has reacted immediate and cautiously the surroundings of the Prime minister.
"If it thinks that it can lose, it will not be candidate", thinks Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"Always it will think that it can win", it corrects Alain Juppé, resignado in front of the evidence.
Euro: the ECB sees  forced to keep his acquisitions of Letters of the State
The last meeting of the Council of governors of the Central Bank European (ECB) of the year would have to allow require the modalities of exit of the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a big number of operations no conventional of monetary policy that would have to finalise to finals of year.
Owing to the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the institute of broadcast of Frankfurt definitely will not be able to allow be so peremptory if it does not want to risk to aggravate a situation more than complicated today in the markets of European obligations.
The political cost would be equal of high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the Minister of French Finances, Christine Lagarde, has backed the active paper exerted by the ECB in favour of the solution of the crisis of the debt of the European States.
It has not wanted to say if it considered that the central bank would have to do more, increasing for example his program of purchase of state obligations.
"I reserve me my opinion for my European mates "....
The day before, in Brussels, during his audience in front of the Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show  more elocuente regarding his intentions, indicating only that the program of purchase of Letters of the State in the secondary market "continued" and that "already will see what decide" during the meeting of the Thursday.
The only that remains clear is that the ECB goes to keep his main invariable type in 1%, the lowest level of his history from May of 2009.
In the practice, the acquisition of obligations of the Treasure by part of the ECB has duplicated  the past week until achieving near of 1.350 million euros.
Besides, according to the indiscretos operators of the market, yesterday would have bought again Irish and Portuguese titles.
In total, the central banks of the eurosistema have purchased titles by a cuantía of 67.000 million euros from May of 2010.
Between the operators of the market, does not doubt  the most minimum that they will follow the shopping (consult the page 29).
The economists neither foresee any significant changes of course.
Although the operations of loans to more than three months already have disappeared of the arsenal of the ECB, this still realises boundless allocations of liquidity to beneficial conditions and with lengths that vary between a week and three months.
The economists expect that today  prolongue this device during some months.
"I do not imagine me that it go to modify considerably his program."
"If no, it would run the risk to cause new tensions in the short term", thinks Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that produce  a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011", anticipates by his side Norbert Bräms, economist in Salt.
Oppenheim.
In relation with the interventions in the market of the public debt, "the ECB would have to keep a volume of purchase of said obligations so that the market remain stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of the exhibitions of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the zone of the euro, the institute of broadcast does not have more option that keep his presence in the market.
"It has to compensate to any price the fault of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevent a marked rise of the performances credited by the most fragile States", thought yesterday an important agent of obligations.
Because, if the types of interest put  by the clouds, the States will have still more problems to reduce his indebtedness, or even to stabilise it.
This is the price to protect to the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi bullfight with young bulls the storm
After Italy have begun the week of a way inquietante, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the backflow of the types of the obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
To the exit of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have affirmed that listened to Giulio Tremonti describe the situation of "indescifrable" and that expected  an unpredictable "weekend", statements denied later by the interested.
Anyway, the Tuesday the difference with the on a long-term basis German types had achieved the record figure of 210 basic points and the price of the agreements of coverage against the risk of failure (CRQ) had shot  until the 263 points, causing a true stir in Rome.
In the Council of ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was upper to 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, manifested  "deeply concerned" by "the turbulences in the markets" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the zone of the euro, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in Hudson Institute.
In reality, his problem is the fault of growth and the stagnation of the income associated to the same, what causes that the State run the risk of not being able to face up to his needs of finance.
The last forecasts of Brussels have supposed a vase of cold water for the government.
It calculates  that the Italian growth will achieve 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012, whereas the budget that is being examined in the Senate bases  in some figures of 1,3% and 2%, respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4,3% of the GDP next year (in front of 3,9% foreseen by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (in place of 2,7%).
Of here the rumour that they can apply new budgetary disposals after the parties, by a cuantía of 7.000 million euros.
"In necessary case, will have to adopt new measures of austerity", thinks the Commissioner of Economic Subjects, Olli Rehn.
By the moment, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
"The bases of his economy are in order and his in good condition accounts, as we carry saying from does time", ensures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator deep down Monetary International manager of Italy in the FMI.
"There is not any immediate problem, neither to short neither on a long-term basis, because in spite of his considerable debt (119,2% of the GDP in 2011, NDLR), the efforts of stabilisation requested to Italy are lower that the required to other countries", comments Pier Carlo Padoan, economist boss of the OCDE.
It remains the problem of the political unsteadiness.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi  enfrentará to a motion of censorship in the Camera of Deputies, after which could anticipate the elections to finals of March.
In such a case, it would open  a little favourable period to the taking of decisions in case of a grave crisis.
The Europeans reflexionan on the reinforcement of the mechanisms of fight against the crisis
Christine Lagarde already has repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think that already have showed the Sunday, at night and by the day, that the Europeans are clearly solidarios, decided, engaged with the defence of his coin and of his monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the relaxation registered yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States has promoted to the governments and to the ECB.
However, we can not speak still of a principle of normalisation.
The agency of Standard qualification & Poor's announced that it could go down the qualification of the debt of Portugal, the most frequent white in the actuality of the speculations.
"To the equal that in May, fault really clarity and political transparency, which weighs significantly on the banking systems", think the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political rhythm is much slower that the rhythm of the markets".
Conscious of this hiatus and of the dangers that hides, the European countries intensify the debates to reinforce the mechanisms of exit of the already existent crisis.
The informal queries between the Ministers of Finances that see  more directly affected and, in general, with his homologous of the G-20 go by good way.
And this taking into account also the meetings of the Eurogrupo and of the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB gathers  today.
In the agenda, the type of measures no conventional of support to the countries of the zone of the euro in the colimador of markets (consult further up).
Regarding the European Bottom of Financial Stability (FEEF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, has initiated the Tuesday in Singapore a route by Asia to inform to the investors of the Far Orient on the novelties of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits does not consist in raising funds, definitely prepares the terrain.
It foresees  that the first broadcasts of titles of the FEEF realise  the next month.
Yesterday, an official representative American has trusted to the agency Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase of the bottoms movilizados by means of an additional direct commitment of the FMI.
Regarding the countries that find  in first line, Portugal and Spain, these  prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation with the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add  to the measures of austerity with a nearer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to advance by a different way to the that followed Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs request international help before applying his own budgetary corrections and to decide the structural reforms that consider indispensable to increase the confidence of durable form.
The capitalist partners of the European bottoms, finally, pose  the available options to accelerate the process of normalisation of the markets of public obligations.
Of I go through Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first in launching the idea that, if the 750.000 million euros movilizados by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not doubt in going back to take out the wallet.
The economists of Barclays Main, an actor of first line in the market of the European public debt, consider that a cuantía of around 100.000 million additional euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in shape of direct injection of liquidity.
It exists the instrument for this: the European mechanism of financial stabilisation, endowed in the actuality with 60.000 million euros.
A council that, definitely, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if they worsen the conditions of market.
Nieve and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
The snowfalls follow causing difficulties of circulation, especially in the secondary network in Bretaña, and can affect to diverse economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments find  in orange alert because of the risk of snowfalls and of training of ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have added  to the twenty departments that already were in orange alert, eighteen from the Wednesday to the half day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined  to the group at night.
According to Météo France, the strong snowfalls fallen affect north of Gironde and Charentes, although also nieva slightly in Island of France.
They expect  some layers of snow of between 2 and 5 cm, on time of between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments affected, and of between 1 and 3 cm, or even until 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the ones of the regions of Drop Normandy, Island of France and Lemosín.
The snowfalls are sufficiently strong as to cause difficulties of circulation and affect to some economic activities, alert Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, has forbidden  the access to several departamental roads to the heavy vehicles of more than 7,5 tonnes, included the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Bretaña is complicated, by what recommend that it do not drive  save in case of need and has forbidden  the circulation of determinate vehicles TER during the day.
During the Thursday, has forbidden  the school transport in Picardía.
It had not foreseen  any specific measure the Wednesday at night to limit the circulation of the heavy vehicles.
The prefectura "urges to all the drivers to that they drive with the main prudence in the roads and to that they adapt his driving to the situation".
The general Direction of the civil aviation (DGAC) asked to the aerial companies that cancelled the Thursday 25% of his flights in the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly owing to the planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends to the aerial passengers that put  in contact with his airline.
In Great Britain, the airport of Gatwick, south of London, and the one of Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until the Thursday in the morning.
Metre of the Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport in the Island of France has achieved his point álgido, llueven thousands of millions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we speak of the 23.000 millions for the metre of the Grand Paris that it has to build the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of bottoms of 4.000 million euros.
In the theoretical plane, this sum will be the one who will allow later to the SGP obtain loans in the markets to fund a part of his double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The law of finances rectificativa of 2010, examined in the commission of finances of the National Assembly this morning, contains the planned devices to find the first part of this money.
They exist two ways: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase of the tax on the offices in the Island of France.
The first, as we read in the article 15 of the text of the project of law, is "in profit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
Besides, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is of 117 million euros to the year".
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "for modernizarlo, increase his product and allocate said increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would obtain  with this method?
Who knows.
In the text do not give  figures.
But it is far of 4.000 millions.
"It requires  that the fiscal resources add  to the 4.000 million euros of the allocation of bottoms that movilizará the State and that will concede  to the Société du Grand Paris to measure that advance the project", can read in the exhibition of reasons.
To the SGP does not surprise him this system.
"From the moment in that they create  income (the two taxes, ndlr), can cover the studies during three years and afterwards receive the 4.000 millions later, as we explain."
"It will register  in the budget and will use  in function of the needs".
The SGP calculates that empecerá to receive the 4.000 millions in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This device, in which the 4.000 millions promised do not appear in the credit, can cause a parliamentary debate slightly lit.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Hackers vengadores And diligent spies
The subject WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, desvela an apparent scandal, a scandal that so only seems scandal in front of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by the regression.
But we go step by step.
The first appearance of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (independently of the nation to which belong) is formed exclusively by cuts of press.
The "extraordinary" American disclosures on the sexual habits of Berlusconi so only reflect what has written  from does months in any newspaper (except which belong to Berlusconi) and the profile siniestramente ridiculizador of Khadafi carries long giving ideas to the artists of nightclub to create his sketches.
The norm according to which the secret files so alone have to be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and no only in this century.
If it visits a bookshop devoted to esoteric publications, will see that each work repeats (on the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-him-Château, the Templarios or the Rosacruz) exactly what had written  in the previous works.
This does not have to  only to that the authors of texts ocultistas do not want to do investigations inéditas (or do not know where look for novelties on the non-existent), but because those who devote  to the occultism no so only trust what already know, what reconfirma that that already had learnt.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies  to the secret files.
The informador is lazy, to the equal that is lazy (or has little anxiety) the boss of the secret services (if it could not be, I what are, redactor of the Libération), that only considers true what can recognise.
The top information secret on Berlusconi that sent the American embassy of Rome to the Department of State was the same that published the Newsweek the previous week.
Then, why they have caused such stir the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, so only they say what all person cultivated already knows, that is to say, that the embassies, at least from the Second World War and since the Bosses of States can call by telephone or take the aeroplane to gather  to dine, have lost his diplomatic function and, to exception of some exercises limited of representation, have transformed  in centres of espionage.
Any viewer that see films of investigation knows it perfectly, so only look that we do not know it by hypocrisy.
Anyway, the fact to repeat it publicly infringe the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of the American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that a hacker any one can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world affects considerably to the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects so much to the victims as to the "hangmen".
But we go in in the true nature of what has happened.
In the past, in the period of Orwell, could conceive to all can as a Big Brother that controlled each gesture of his súbditos.
The profecía of Orwell has done  reality since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction realised, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen converted  in this way in a complete victim of the eye of the power.
But when it shows , as it occurs now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of the can can not escape to the control of a hacker, the relation of control leaves to be unidirectional and goes back  circulate.
The power controls to each citizen, but each citizen (at least the hacker, chosen like the vengador of the citizens) can know all the secrets of the power.
How it can hold a power that no longer can neither conserve his own secrets?
It is true, as it already said Georg Simmel, that a true secret is a secret empty (and an empty secret never will be able to be desvelado); also it is true that all knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is in reality an empty secret, without secret, since it proceeds of the public field; but desvelar, as it has done WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were secret empty means to remove him all can.
WikiLeaks Has not hurt him any to Sarkozy or to Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and to Obama.
Which will be the consequences of this wound caused to a so powerful power?
It results evident that, in the future, the States no longer will be able to put in the network any information reserved, since it would be like publishing it in a poster in full street.
But also it results evident that, with the current technologies, can not  expect keep confidential conversations by telephone.
At all it results easier that discover if and when a Head of state has displaced  in aeroplane and has put  in contact with one of the homologous.
How they will be able to keep in the future private and confidential relations?
I know perfectly that, by the moment, my forecast is thing of science fiction and, therefore, novelesque, but imagine me to governmental agents that displace  of discreet form in diligencias with itineraries incontrolables, carrying messages that have learnt  by heart or, as a lot, hiding some data written in the heels of his shoes.
This information conserves  then, in an only copy, in enclosed drawers with key: to end of accounts, the attempt of espionage of the Watergate had less success that WikiLeaks.
In the past, have written that the technology at present advances like a crab, that is to say, to backwards.
A century after the telegraph without wires have revolutionised the communications, Internet has gone back to create a telegraph with wires (telephone).
The strips of video (analog) had allowed to the researchers of the cinema study a film step by step, advancing and retreating, discovering all the secrets of the setting, whereas now the CD (digital) so only allow to advance or retreat of chapter in chapter, that is to say, to enormous proportions.
With the trains of high speed, can go of Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas in aeroplane, with the trips that comports, need three hours and average.
Therefore, it is not at all out of the normal that the politics and the technicians of communication carry us again to the cars of horses.
A last comment.
In the past, the press tried to comprise what wove  secretly in the embassies.
In the actuality, are the embassies those that ask confidential information to the press.
Climate: the botches of France in his promises of finance
A year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, is time to to examine if they have respected  the promises of finance quickly unblocked (calls fast start or precocious) realised by the countries developed.
And they have  desvelado the French botches.
In the Agreement of Copenhagen, the countries developed engaged  to provide 30.000 million dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union engaged  to contribute 7.200 million euros in three years and France 1.260 million euros (that is to say, 420 millions to the year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table his best letters to convince to his partners that his commitment with the finances fast start is true: a report detailing the measures of his States members, a press conference, a big complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The operation appreciable resulted transparency and was appreciated by what really voucher: the developing countries and the civil society would want that all the countries developed did the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has freed 2010 2.200 million euros, which situates it in the good way to the fulfillment of his commitment of 7.200 millions in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, the things are more complicated.
According to the Agreement of Copenhagen, the money has to be "new and additional" to guarantee that it realise  a complementary effort, without prejudicing to the official help to the development.
Alas, it has not arrived  to an agreement on what means "new and additional".
When the European Commission proposed a harmonisation, some States members, included France, have blocked the procedure.
In the actuality, each chooses the reference that more suits him.
For example, the European Commission has taken like reference the year 2009: it keeps  the international finance and add  150 millions in three years in concept of finance fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references regarding the year or to the level of the official help to the development.
By the contrary, France considers that the finance of "all the new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words it does not do  reference to the expenses of the previous years neither to the total level of the official help to the development.
In concrete, the cuantía total of the help of France to the developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), while it pretends that it respects his commitment in matter of new "and additional bottoms"...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, it does not exist any norm and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro loaned equivale to a euro donado.
Obviously, such thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the utilisation of loans can be justified for determinate investments that are profitable (frequently, projects related with the reduction of broadcasts that base  in technologies more effective), results false to present a euro that goes  to recover like equivalent to a euro that  dona... As a lot, so only it would have to  compute for his commitments the cost of the loan for the country that concedes the loan (that is to say, the equivalent to a type of interest).
But France does not find useful such reasoning: "it respects" his commitment of 420 million euros doing 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8,5% of donations (36,1 million euros); it consult the document of the EU to see it by his own eyes.
It treats  of the only country of the Union that uses so frequently the loan.
Germany uses it in 46%, whereas Denmark, Low Countries or Slovakia, amongst other, respect his commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to fulfil his commitment, France so only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in his finance fast start, France realises a double abuse: by a part, in relation with the actions in the time and, by another, in relation with the true financial effort.
Spending so alone 36,1 million euros, achieves to give the impression that it spends 420 new "millions and additional", such as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finances (because it seems that it is Bercy the one who has occupied  of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, so much inside the EU (why went the others States members to be followed donando when they can simply loan?) As in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not silly...
The chapter of the precocious finance is a minucia, relatively in the short term, in relation with the group of the negotiations on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand of more in the immense machinery that is the CMNUCC.
We expect that it was not like this.
It was what went, results indispensable to learn of this first year of precocious finances.
In the first place, France could announce a change in his method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect his commitments and of the same way that the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could do that they advanced the debates on the bets at stake in relation with the finance on a long-term basis (another essential chapter that is debating  at present): we will not rid us of the question of the "additional character" neither of the method to compute the loans.
France could change his posture to go back  so progressive in relation with this question as it is it with others.
Therefore, it remains us the hope of the new Minister of Environment, the lady Kosciusko-Morizet, that will arrive to Cancún next week.
An announcement surprise on the fast start of France and on his vision of the "additional character" and of the utilisation of the loans would contribute to improve the level of necessary international confidence to advance in the negotiations.
Warning on the pesticidas ingeridos by the boys
A boy of 10 years ingiere in a day 81 different chemicals, as it indicates a study published the Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the ancient movement by the rights and the respect of the future generations).
The association, that warns that his results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analysed, but are ilustrativos of the problematic treated", purchased in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that is used to to consume a boy of some ten years in four foods and a tentempié to the day.
These foods taken like model, that respect the official recommendations (five parts of fruits and cool vegetables, three of dairy products and 1,5 litres of water to the day), as well as the sweets, were examined in the laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticidas, heavy metals and other contaminantes.
The balance of the dish results overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified like cancerígenos possible or likely and five substances classified like cancerígenos safe, as well as 37 susceptible substances to act like perturbadores endocrine (PE), according to the studies of diverse institutions like the international Centre of investigation on the cancer.
"Although, in practically the whole of the cases, do not surpass  the legal limits for each one of the chemicals of individual form, our study shows clearly that the exhibition of the consumers to contaminantes possibly cancerígenos and/or PE results worrisome", signals the association.
For the desayuno, the butter and the tea with milk contain by himself alone more than a ten of waste cancerígenos possible and three considered like cancerígenos safe, as well as near of a veintena of waste that can prejudice to the system hormonal.
The apple, mattered of Brazil, foreseen like tentempié for the school, contains trace of six chemicals, included a fungicida forbidden in France.
The same applies  to the green beans of Kenia, included in the food, in which the study has detected trace of a powerful insecticide forbidden in the EU.
Besides, the filete Russian, the tuna in tin and even the bar of bread or the chewing gum were prepared with pesticidas and other chemicals.
In the water of the tap, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the slice of salmon was the most nutritious "" with 34 chemical waste detected and even the analysis of the dish of plastic used to heat the food in the microwaves was not entirely clean.
The final risk that generate these "cocktails of contaminantes" for the consumer "probably  subestima", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Them Verts (EE-LV), by his part, has proposed "in front of the gravity of the situation" apply a moratorium on the utilisation of pesticidas to brake "the increase of the illnesses associated to the civilisation".
In July, a study of the European Agency of Alimentary Security (AESA) indicated the presence of waste of 365 pesticidas different identified in the fruit and the vegetable consumed in Europe, of which 76 in the cereals.
