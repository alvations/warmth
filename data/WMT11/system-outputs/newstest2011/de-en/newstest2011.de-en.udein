What they should do which ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague are familiar neither with Voldemort, nor the 'Konditorei. "
The new Office of the gentlemen of the capital, from the ranks of ČSSD obviously certain language barriers need to be overcome, in order to be able to understand their old and new members from the ODS in Prague advice and representation at all in the town.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has members of the new Council from ČSSD cut off times a little ," as they have control the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the present coalition partners, in Prague at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced in the mattered era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, is borrowed from some of the most prominent actors and Causae situations.
Surprisingly, showed that the new councils fall in relation to these new notions something in the dark.
The claim they, at least.
Voldemort "who is?"
"No idea."
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy ', Lukáš Kaucký, the new Office of the Commissioner for Culture responded to the test of" godfather's words. "
But also the Office of the Commissioner Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar manner.
For example, to the concept of "golf hole."
"The is the only expression of those who put me here that I would use and again."
"I think that not a lot of slang."
From the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz had published in June this year, before the election, Congress of the ODS, the editorial editors pickte six terms, particularly those which are notoriously linked with the Prague government.
The Socialists should the terms' Voldemort, "" most Prague golf hole, "" in the Konditorei go "and" bull neck ,"" betrayal of the capital, "and" verblechen "define.
Prague Office three gentlemen agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague education system promised - firstly of its participation in the talks, was declining but then not even the phone.
The fifth council Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in the first place.
"I don't care about these things are, as the Civic Democrats to talk to each other, and I am not passing judgement."
"I think it is important, as we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he responded.
As has been suggested, would have realised Lukáš Kaucký in the abovementioned headline supposedly not that Bém mayor, Roman Janoušek is the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former.
The term 'Voldemort "says Kaucky absolutely nothing and that the only word he erriet the test correctly," was the greatest Prague golf hole. "
"It is the tunnel Blanka 'says Kaucký, added to security but still," but I know this more from the newspapers. "
And in jest: "I will probably show a language course."
The "Gulf hole" will then not only of matador Karel Březina, but also the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as Blanka entziffert tunnel.
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term stands and Voldemort Lukáš Plachý even knows where is this figure and in that way, what does it mean to be "to be moving in the Konditorei."
"I believe, in other words, to go to any old Prague restaurant works' Plachý is fairly close to solving the puzzle, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms.
Březina he asserts, in line with, but this knowledge could have achieved more from the newspapers than this vocabulary own him.
Judging by the test participants after, it seems, under the Social Democrats, in fact, to be no similar eingebürgerten slang.
"I have asked my colleagues, but it appears that there is no such thing as us."
"We would call on us by name, and then we also use words or nickname," the Chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský says - loosely from his party "Hulda."
"I was at school (Bříza Birke named), but I do not know whether my colleagues mention as" us tells Karel Březina his nickname.
Deník Aktuálně.cz the newspaper has tried out the names and see as - he works.
Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "Old" the representative Miroslav Poche that made before the election by the party machinations Sponsorship attention is being called by some colleagues' Igráček " (famous Czech Lego's figure).
Nickname are the only thing that allowed the social democrats, in whose use of language.
Hulínský it may supposedly if it is called 'Hulda "but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
Be Spitzname "Doctor the rubber truncheons' rights' has to do so, allegedly, that Petr Hulínský has earned his title Doctor juris Bratislaver to the police academy.
The government wants to prevent the torture of "witch" and a booklet issued
Women who are branded in Burkina Faso to witch, are usually a common social features.
They belong to more of the older generation, they can find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are not a constraint and have children.
If one of these women to Hexe will ', "they will strictly isolated, so that they can be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"Including young and healthy women will be spared this, as they have been helping in the work and give birth to children," a decoration sister describes the situation, who cares in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim by more than a hundred women who emitted by their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against these abnormal "social action."
And issued a brochure for this reason, which is to eliminate the "witch hunt."
Is, however, a catch.
"More than 70% of adults cannot read in Burkina Faso," the newspaper 'derStandard "on the dilemma of the written information pointed.
To be accused of witchcraft is, but also in other African countries become commonplace.
Ghana, to the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, who 27 years Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - it bucket with Petroleum and set them alight.
About this incident the server (including BBC reported.
The perpetrators claimed, however, the matter would have been just a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
Their version that oil was inflamed, which will be used for ritual Salbungen.
And, once the group have tried to "exorcise an evil spirit" of the woman. "
Isolation of "witch" in support of the people, regardless of their education.
"The standard" from quoted a 42 years of entrepreneurial Burkina Faso: "Fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat today," he said.
While the government is trying in Burkina Faso at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambia niche President last year, the President has mitgemischt itself properly.
"President Yahya Jammeh revived after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch hunt, because these were supposed to share their death and now will try to kill the president himself, by black magic."
"He reminded Schamane from nearby Guinea to help, which abducted accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the bodyguard of President indiscriminately detained men and women violently from Gambia niche villages and on the farm of the President in Kanilai expressed," the organisation Amnesty International gave in her report.
On the farm, have been forced to drink the eingekerkerten people a Absud from plants with halluzinogener effect that inspires but also colon and kidney problems.
Arretierten survived two of the people to stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure the nearly a thousand prisoners have been released.
Bakala a tenants of: It fuels in the stove - but pay higher rent
An older untersetzter man leaving the clients centre of society RPG Byty "Kohlebarons" Zdeněk Bakala, the greatest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a file with three new rental contracts to three homes: On its own, and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three has been increased in the context of what has been called the "deregulation" just the rent.
Rather than 3,500 kronor month rent the son should be made to fork out in the next year for a 2 room home with kitchen 4100 kroner in the second category.
"And because there are no housing times fluent in the hot water and heat must be in an ordinary coal stove," he irked if the finger on the new lease of the son, to which he has signed a power.
"But what - I signed," he said resignedly annoys half and half.
Citizens association BytyOKD.cz who advises the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," the tenants to sign the new contracts, and not just to wait until 7 December in which it intends to publish guidance as to how they are proceeding against such contracts.
But the man is on the horizon.
"One says this, the other," he makes a finsteres face.
The region of Ostrava is so in large "deregulation laboratory."
After New Year's this deregulation is paying most rental housing in the Czech Republic, whose tenants so far, no highly marketable rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG's waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region already in Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday packed full.
Equal alongside the door's Bodyguards of a security agency and it is a call.
'Rent in 2011, "so clearly a special Tastfeld on Touchscreen.
Shortly angetippt and the equipment from spuckt a numbers slip.
Little we have the number '157 "entziffert and already they piepst in the large display from the ceiling of the waiting period.
Half an hour later, one of the series.
A little later an older married couple enters the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not the new rent.
Most people are here to deal with the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters, and so on.
Fly in the region is in the middle of November the Ostrava Kuverts with the new rental contracts most tenants out of a total 44 000 homes of the portfolios of the RPG in the post boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letter a rental increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The specific counter to the new rents in clients centre is opened since 18 November.
"The action is a little more than a week, that is to say, this is only the beginning" to respond to the women behind the counter after a moment of hesitation, as the "client" out as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections of Ostrava originating from Parliament Lubomír Zaorálek Group Vice President had taken up by the ČSSD this issue quite loudly, it is no wonder that the newspapers today are full of them.
"20 years I want from them a new ground."
"Not once ne besch. WC's glasses have been able to change it," the first man said air power.
Until now, particularly pensioners on counters, according to the staff, in order to persuade themselves, whether or not they receive the promised tenants moderation, which promises them RPG if they sign this Spezialangebot in time.
Enjoy a half reduced February rent the other tenants are also coming to the sign the new lease by 15 December.
Until now, deregulation counters' is in Havířov but everything else, as overburdened by demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011, because here," officials estimate the counters.
RPG offered both on their websites, as well as tape blackboards individual rental agreements, where it is necessary.
The rent parties should not agree to the new rent, however, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as the information on the only possible and to understand perfectly legitimate legal approach 'RPG said on its Web sites.
"No one is on trial," says the staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the clients centre gives it at least partly right.
"I have more than 13,000 (kroner) pension, from 5,000 remain left me for dinner, where I should find the money for a legal dispute," he says.
Then the employees is uncertain.
"See."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them on the media, they should not sign and so that the people are watching ', is to remember them.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to New Year's 2011 and RPG Byty is the rental increase, according to an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not enough times for maintenance of Wohnfonds," Pavel Klimeš, the director of the society argued Wohnungs portfolios RPG Byty and - particularly by resentful tenants criticized neglect of housing fund is, in the opinion of homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
During RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010, from the rent collected four billion was invested in housing, in the four years from 2011 until 2014 should be 5.2 billion.
In the large format voluntary LCD) display in the ceiling toward the Polstersesseln in the waiting room by Havířov appear repeatedly staged a few red shining information.
"The rent rises in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes by RPG."
7,50 CZK this bovine "always means per square metre and month," is to be read in the LCD) Monitor.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG the rent increased by 38%.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extreme low rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square metre," RPG argues.
2600 homes rent remains in the next year at the same level.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation not driving rents soaring, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposed another obligation: All revenue from rental increase (see diagram) the company will once again invest in the homes, especially in the heat - savings in new windows and insulation.
Priority - but this will come to those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects one saw - the office is also a nursery
The office buildings Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would be expected here for a mini nursery, heard with all what: Paint added walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini Außenterrasse on the playground.
This nursery is since last year, the staff of Arch.Design available.
The Projektierungs- and architecture office Arch.Design, Ateliers from which a number of eminent Brünner buildings come for the new buildings Avriopoint to awaken from the first drafts with the premises for its firms' mini nursery.
) wise in, since most of his 90 staff (Interior's age are the baby boom and the company is keen that the Projektantinnen and architect domestic return as quickly as possible to their jobs.
Shortening to work together with the possibility, is the nursery another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees the concept of the social programme.
-architektinnen the a civil engineer and have it easier to express their ambitious work and child care under one roof.
The mini nursery is an original idea of staff (Interior) by Arch.Design and with the support of management managed them financial assistance from the European Union and of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini nursery is financed through the Operation programme of human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget in the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants of EUR 2.8 million) CZK the necessary facilities and resources could be obtained, and, for a period of 2 years is ensured and qualified staff for the operation.
After the absorption of funds (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obliged to conduct a mini nursery 3 more years at their own expense.
The preparation of this project was a whole year, while the social economy rating made at the request of management is effective aid.
The children fully qualified staff working visit care - a nurse, and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten children without age can moderate restrictions, even though most of them are about three years old.
And, because it concerns a mini nursery, 5 children should only be present at the same time, however, the day on alternate several children each other.
The nursery farm is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all the staff have in relation to the use of the nursery, the equal rights - without regard to the corporate hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini is the nursery yet comparable with the Framework Programme the pre.
Children play not only particularly excellent teaching them will be needed - of basic knowledge to Vorschulunterricht, incidentally, they also have to learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer, which is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can always look at the child and so the stress of the late collection dropped the children from a nearby nursery school.
The parents use their working time more productive.
No wonder that natural and loyal labour relations come here too.
Arch.Design reihte so under the Czech company a in the recruitment of new staff clear Benefits offer, the families are friendly enough and through such programmes their staff marketing support.
A bone House fascinates even after 100 years, you look at the Interieure of Gaudi
The roof is like the backs of a prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the spinal column of Dinosauriers and Balkone are aufgerissene Fischmäuler.
That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house of the local inhabitants received its organic forms the nickname "bone House."
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone and mosaic Kachelsplittern in scales façades remotely and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features of youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the House plays with dream liability lines zärtlichen paints and Texturen, reminding of nature and living creatures.
It was only on closer inspection we noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful.
During the night the whole façade even plastic acts, dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung stepped up the glamour of the colours.
The same momentum full lines and tortuous forms dominate even the interior of the house.
Creates ripple effects-formed wooden copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and beverages.
The house Batlló in quarter Eixample in the busy shopping streets Passeig de Grácia No 43 by the transformation of the house, which dates from 1877, the architects of Emilio Sala Cortese said.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea Gaudís to an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction.
The rental house Casa Batlló devised, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He cooperated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Now on the drawing board that originated Dekorationen for representative of Realitätenbesitzers housing and also the use of Mosaiken in the facade was his idea.
In the shaping of the facade also numerous other Bildner and artists with worked, however.
The joint work on drafting the Casa Batlló the start of a fruitful collaboration of Jujola and Gaudí was.
So Jujol participated in the construction of the house in Casa Gaudís Milá Park Güell in which other plants are located by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion of the House received by the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nickname "bone House."
Others called it of specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning House."
They say, at the top of the buildings the sword of holy Georg, the existence was presented of Catalonia.
But also other elements bildhauerische symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí for the House devised a unique time for the former central heating system with Entlüftungskanälen Kaminen and typical.
Something bizarre their 45 ° C tendency is already.
In its creation Gaudí diminished then consistently ignored all building regulations and did not in any way out of this.
Before the start of construction - he a "by the city of the appropriate planning permission but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later, with the finalisation were so horrified by the outcome that they demanded.
Members of the Council were, among other things, that the construction of its pillars, even intervened in the public sidewalk.
To make changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - only 15 days after the call the urban community Josep Batlló issued a request for approval of the rental of two highly pertinent floors of the House - and it has been given him promptly.
The homeowners themselves drew in the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor of a Gesellschaftssalon was on the third floor of the bedroom and private rooms of the flat were.
The ground floor has been leased to a Juweliergeschäft.
The whole sechsstöckige building undergoes a staircase up upwards to Dachterrasse.
Through the fundamental elements of the placements all right corner and straight lines have been removed and replaced through bent and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be combined with the opening of the completely Salontüren and so a larger society could comfortably chatting, without having to give up during vertraulicheren talks at a certain amount of intimacy.
The house received by Gaudís conversion except a new façade, a fairly unusual roof and a further two floors.
Gaudís game impressively with the light, as well as the blue and white glasierten Kacheln facing the courtyard is disguised and light courts.
The game of these two colours gives all the floors of the House a maximum amount of light.
He was simply exploiting the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colours, the sunlight on the contrary, to absorb.
The house Casa Batlló, in 2005, the World Heritage List of Unesco was included, can visit today, everyone.
In the first floors geräumigste prächtigste housing and that the public is made available.
The homeowners decided only in the years to this step and this on the occasion of the Creator 150.Geburtstags of the famous.
When you said that this is a very profitable business, it maintained the surveys, and we extended it to other joint and Dachgeschossräume from including Dachterrasse.
The price to visit the Baudenkmals, however, is no trifling matter, he amounts to EUR 16,50, students, retired people, groups and owner of tourist cards get 20% reduction.
This sum exceeds the entry price to other Gaudí's buildings in the city.
Who would like to get to know the real atmosphere of the House with his Drachentürmchen, should try to make friends with one of the residents of the house and visit him at home.
The right mattress and proper beds rust? Women have other aspirations than men
Not tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface area lies - so, mattress and rust are the good bed.
These must complement but harmonious to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In selecting many things play a role - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of Schläfers.
Just as important the Interieur in which mattress and rust are subordinate is.
Typical example?
In a heated Wochenendhaus, not regularly, will be suited Latexmatratzen are not good, since they need much longer "warm to be."
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual a polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be changed on a regular basis.
If they have not actually enough Entlüftungskanälchen in essence and are on a strong record, moisture in congestion increases, so it is not impossible that is under their Schimmel.
In the election also have a role to play, of course, what we are used to.
Who has been a long time in a foreign country, where very high with mattresses soft layer usual, will be able to get used to the difficult low mattress with hard surface.
"All Eishockeyspieler who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they are not able to sleep more right."
Abgeschundenen "on their shoulders and waists, they simply need a soft layer from Visco's sparkling (Memory Foam - a form of memory's Polymer)."
"I commend them including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the 'information' from ligaments and skin badly," declared Hadamcziková Sylva, specialising in padded furniture.
I have therefore concerned many Eishockeyspielern years ago, but also other customers that mattresses with Visco's sparkling (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide the Tempur manufacturers and others, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer of Tropico."
And we need not necessarily be a famous Eishockeyspieler to learn to appreciate the advantages of Visco's foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The sparkling optimalisiert said its severity and absorbierten form in the heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body.
Anywhere it pinches in the middle of the night are not rolling around like after a major fight.
It simply sleep much better.
The sparkling viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene).
In the election of Matratzengröße should be the body size still include the length of Fußsohlen, i.e. around 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman are to the 180 cm high, need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each Schläfer should at least stand 90 cm is widely available, so together 180 cm.
In Einzelbetten, for example, on singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
The comfort, and also for any visitors.
Otherwise the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed broad: "If one is on the backs, nor should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises of mine tells. Helen Prokopová who Zunftmeisterin the Polsterer and Raumausstatter dedicated for years the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this issue also on technical schools.
In a double bed, everyone needs a rust and their own mattress, but be careful with the shopping, the mattresses are too high.
Otherwise, nothing else is left to install than Roste in different levels and it is not long on each bed frame possible.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with pen skeletal 15 cm, three centimetres to form class and the fine buffer should at least.
"With obvious or Hinsetzen one must feel the feathers, in any case," Helena Prokopová warns.
Every mattress makes a specific Rosttyp required.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as together evolved Siamzwillinge have to seek out in the bedroom.
These mattresses will not reveal itself and the reference you cannot wash, which today is already common practice and there is.
And as you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress) after five to seven years ago, becoming a huge (and congested sieve.
That is also why experts advertising slogans reject who promise in mattresses a life span of up to 25 years ago, even a lifetime guarantee.
Any thing has its ifs and buts.
And that is why a more practical advice of dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm breadth, we should not be afraid of the hygiene waschbaren, abziehbaren salary, but it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner that we can withdraw and wash easily.
Even if Matratzenbezüge today usually produced with Rundumreißverschluss, so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for Waschvorgang and washing machines sizes!), the kind of manipulation with larger mattresses is, above all, on their own, often, like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They have in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record?
Get out!
Or no more than a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
So they should provide the record, rather, with ventilation holes (if not content) and mattresses are used with the skeletal and 15 cm minimum level with so pen pockets nuclear and fine buffer.
A polyurethane mattresses not belong on such a basis.
For not verstellbare from Lattenroste with 14 to 18 play pen (Lamellen) Latex- Sandwichmatratzen (or is perhaps also appropriate combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with greater Lattenanzahl, from 28 and greater stroke do to regulate with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and possibility which Lattenhärte.
On verstellbare Lamellenroste no mattresses belong with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische disguise --.
Alongside the recruitment of Steife the pen make specific flexible shoulder modules will also be needed.
This is a specific fastening the pen, make it possible to make the stroke einzudrücken or verwinkeln so that they can provide the specific Einsinken Schläfers the back of.
Especially men with broad shoulders for an important cause.
There are even Matratzenhersteller who have started in 'Herrenmatratzen "soft areas to use the shoulder area.
Also the honourable is intended - they takes these soft zone in Hüftgegend.
For most customers are systems (Lattoflex punktelastische wing stroke) or Roste certainly burden with points of contact " Pads Multitorsionsfederung with calls.
Pressure will be distributed to a number of points, thereby reducing the tensions.
But, if you are on the right mattress and correct rust used a bad (too big and pillow fülliges) that most benefits are lost.
Here, too, as a rule of thumb: The pillow is to buttress its head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders rich, so the shoulder muscles to relax.
Ideal a 50 is therefore x 60 cm big cushions as it may be, for example, the Scandinavians.
Within the pages of this pillow should (with the side discharge zone in rust or soft zone in the mattress) offset the shoulder height.
Something have our modern mattresses with the former (with hay) Strohsäcken fat but common.
Modern manufacturer using ever more frequent natural materials or at least whose mixtures.
In mattresses the new magic word "bio means."
Will oil raw materials used in the production of natural oils Polyurethanschäumen increasingly figures - for example Rizinus- and soya oil.
Soya is used well by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means in mattresses, which is its core from materials purely natural origin," says Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus by the company.
Natural substances are used, but also in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
One can allow themselves but also micro capsules, the spread in sleeping or Lavendelduft fresh woodland.
Here, too, it makes a difference between men and women.
While the men 'kühlender "Pflanzenextrakt is used from Birkenblättern so that Matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cool the body, have the salary for women" wärmende "effect.
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten suggest the blood circulation, the weaker sex is in sleeping wohlig so warm.
And the current favorite?
Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren Zellstruktur with ruins and is therefore more active than breathing standard polyurethane foams, and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of various Steife (severity) by Kaltschäumen and Visco's foaming does occur more zones occur 'mattresses who know exactly where we are head, hip and at your heels.
For a quality mattress, however, has to be made to fork out over 7000 kronor and more.
Gesundheitsmatratzen are burdened but usually with lower VAT because they qualify as medical assistance.
The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage.
One looks to save on the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Magniflex with the brand offers the mattress Duofreeze in relation verstepptem Visco sparkling at CZK 11.990's Memory for.
The second to get it free.
It was the material Tempur that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling materials with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace.
No surprise, but they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts face enormous excess burdens at the start.
Tempur in heat soft, cool environment it will take root again.
So there is adapting the human body perfect and distributed in an optimal manner the physical pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally the sleep increased comfort.
Viskoelastische sparkling materials are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as when special Fußpolstern, which will make the legs and Gefäßen relief.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, the sparkling materials Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products.
Ever more parents want to have people monitoring equipment for the kids under control
The fear for their own children is growing and as more and more parents consider it by GPS to monitor.
The system, which was invented initially to the tracing of cars, can monitor human as well, which would be useful in such cases, such as the trace recently unemployed Anička Janatková disappearance of nine years.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet but soon, there will not be greater than a Armbanduhr.
Many people has enabled the case of missing Anička in fear and terror and so they are looking for ways to protect their children better.
For the price of a deterioration of their privacy.
"We are trying to say to everyone that there is no way around this by pioneers, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," Petr Pilin by society Macro Weil says, is one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that it can come in the case of the abuse of such equipment, for example, if there is someone in the pockets, not that he is aware of them, but we have had so far, no such case."
"Most customers buy it really for security reasons," Pilin adds.
His opinion, the child should know but, increasingly, what purpose does the "box" and how you use them in an emergency.
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková, however, points out that a child, if such a thing may not take it its easy to discard.
"Even very small children are showing great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"The phones initially among parents awoke great expectations, but they can be shut down just as easily as to how these new surveillance equipment," Bočková thinks woman.
Their opinion is also debatable whether such a body in the event of an attack helps.
"On planned kidnappings monitored the kidnappers virtually always, whether the child has any electronics in itself, it could be located."
Today, it is the mobile phone. "
"If such monitoring equipment were wider use, they would find these also because their sales certainly would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the police, the criminals are always a step ahead," the psychologist says.
It acknowledges, however, that similar devices can in a sudden attack by a paedophile well be helpful.
Roberta Čech RC monitoring by society, according to the tracking services for both cars, as well as for offering people, can help, the existence of such an appliance, even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The machine can adapt so that it asks each position in certain intervals."
"Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the final position of the person concerned is available."
"On more expensive equipment, a bent knife has even incorporated, this means that if you are wrong and hinfällt movement is still sending out, the machine an immediate warning of position," claims Mr Čech.
His opinion could perform similar services including smart phones with navigation, one needs only einzuspielen a special software.
The problem of the current positioning equipment, is that it is either to equipment in a matchbox's size, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the danger that you lose them.
Mr Pilin by the Macro Weil says that testing thus present devices, which look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible aggressor must not realise that there is a surveillance or positioning device.
"Or he realises that only after a certain period, which the police are a time advantage," he adds.
No matter which way the trend is towards Armbändern - or supporters, always used the same technology, such as the vehicle tracking.
So the combination of positioning function system (as in Ms in the car), and the function of a mobile phone, which reports the current position with the help of GPS.
The army has so many Zündschnüre that we could quite umwickeln the Czech Republic you think but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres Zündschnüre, detonated with bombs.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already made 224 miles powder to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years.
The only problem is the durability of Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The Army bought the Zündschnüre of the company STV Group, for example, come to a mere 40 million kronor.
In its explanatory statement, the purchase of the huge quantity of powder replied the General Staff for MF consume Dnes, the soldiers would annually to 60 kilometres of powder.
According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern, the MF accosted Dnes that emerges from this indication that the whole of the army would have to go through an intensive year pyrotechnic training - of all of the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably can be justified.
This length is also actually 25,000 Detonationen.
But even so this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
But if the old set of experts is that two metres powder enough for the training of every new professional soldiers completely, then the army through this Neueinkäufe has been, even under the terms of the increased needs of the pioneering special forces - a reassuring stockpile created for the already mentioned, 225 years.
Soldiers in the process of rapid deployment Brigade recently complained the defence minister, Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so profound are limited due to lack of funds.
The under trousers shortage to say nothing.
"I do not go well, why do they buy such vast quantities Zündschnüre of us."
But it is ultimately their decision, they will know to what they need them. "
"For us, the army is like a good customer, we come as traders largely look," the marketing manager of STV Group Jan Děcký says.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder so that, the army would have been so at least eingedeckt for ten years with this "ammunition."
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, but only for a period of four years of use Zündschnüre Armeepyrotechniker and police, and only two years ago.
"In perfect storage also are probably four years, mentioned possible," admits of them, but I want to be accused as a soldier not criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the duration of use must be tested thoroughly any munitions, whether it is reliable, and not the life of soldiers at risk.
These tests are not in vain, but will cost more money.
Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantities rebate for 445 kilometres powder.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 244 miles', tells us the viewpoint of buyers Pejšek spokesman of the Ministry of Defence.
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption Pyrotechnikern Zündschnüren by the police, the disposing of ammunition from the second world war, the Soviet army or brother, 1,500 metres more than a few years.
And the police only ever ordered such quantities of these munitions, which can consume it before the end of the use of the long term.
The safety of Pyrotechniker because, in addition, it holds open up the possibility of flexible shopping more modern and reliable Zündschnüre.
The Ministry of Defence already has huge problems in the winding up of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of the Warsaw Treaty when the Czechoslovak zweihunderttausendköpfige People's army was preparing for her campaign on the Rhine.
The Pyrotechnikern, the MF Dnes accosted, the Czech armed forces expected in a couple of years ago, the same problem in the elimination of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre she has bought today as "good."
Until now, I have contacts, I was won thanks to the competition.
The victorious placement in competition 'small entrepreneurs of the year' Lukáš Pytloun have helped the sale of the franchise of its hotels.
Winners of last year, the course of the competition "small entrepreneurs of the year" has been Lukáš Pytloun in Liberec.
The story of his success is beginning to look like a film script.
Lukáš Pytloun went like.
Only abroad, he was aware that it is missing in Liberec at good accommodation expenses opportunities at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and through a bank loan he erstand a baufälliges house with five homes.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth year onwards, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The then price / quality ratio angered me and I tried to do something about it ', Lukáš Pytloun says.
The first rekonstruierte apartment rented it to foreign workers.
The whole gain he invested immediately back into the house, which he subsequently umbaute step by step on the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, it succeeded in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec four pensions to open two style just restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 beds all accommodation categories.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the four star hotel 'Pytloun design hotel ."
This year, there was another excellent hotel.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, we have sold our franchise concept, and other stakeholders in the franchise of Pytloun's hotels have already been reported," the entrepreneur number one says of last year.
"Large proportion of this licence sales to the instigation of hotels had the victory in the competition" entrepreneurs of the year, "Mr Pytloun adds congratulatory.
The victory has brought him greater fame, popularity in Liberec and environment.
"I realised the people on the street, often even after she congratulated me and I must say that this was true well," he recalls.
I really recommend all those who want to create something to take part in this competition.
We need to win not equal, every town is a good thing.
He says that he prefers to date, from the contacts and acquaintances benefits to which it would not have been anything else.
"With some of the people I met as a result of the competition, I have so far, regular commercial relations."
Associated with the success of the glory is reflected in his view, even a little bit on any of its staff.
And, as he has to the seventy.
"I note in them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something a general recognition."
I think that this really is not only as a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is just something in the foreground 'Lukáš Pytloun means modest.
I hope my successors a ruhigeres year, when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination Farmet has seen the worst.
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year in the last year, going against Karel Žďárský, firms Farmet holders.
The jury then paid tribute to the efforts which he stampfte from the small Werkzeugbau Česká Skalice in a company from the soil, which makes hundreds of millions of pounds.
"I can say that this has encouraged not only myself but also all my staff and reinforces our confidence in the struggle with the competition," said the winner of the previous year.
At the start of the corporate history of Farmet the effort was to do something useful.
And as then, the state offered his father, Karel Žďárský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop to lease, he was not long left his career in the company, where he was employed until then, sausen and founded with a few comrades his father a separate company to manufacture Plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil press.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest producers of mechanical presses throughout Central Europe.
But only mentioned by the success in competition and its Medialisierung it is also aware the specialized public.
"Not only that our customers take the brand clearly Farmet now intense, including our foreign partners began the fact of being able to work with a company that has struggled in their country the greatest success to attach greater value," says Karel Žďárský.
The past year has been at Farmet, however, not just in the name of victory euphoria.
The commemoration came from the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis schüttelte at the time, even less the citizens but especially businesses, has just reached its climax, many companies have been forced to suspend their investment projects and restricting the purchase of new equipment and technology.
"This situation could not escape, we, of course."
"The sales were around 40 per cent, we had to pick up the production and even to limit layoffs," said Karel Žďárský
A viable companies must take sometimes such unpopular measures.
But it was able to get a grip on the situation and to keep the company in the black figures, even if lower profits than before the crisis.
In one of the company was not prepared to make cuts - the investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we encouraged our presentation at international fairs and Žďárský bought main prices for domestic exhibitions," says.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales grow again, and with them, the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner do much joy of victory, but in more calm," Karel Žďárský leaves.
An opinion poll, with nonsensical rules clean
The opinion poll at the "absurdity of the Year" for the fourth time is part of the entrepreneur competition.
Some nonsensical rules already managed to create from the world.
The dubious winners of the next generation of the opinion poll "absurdity of the Year," which has become a duty to create documents to authorities, which are available online.
So, more than a third decided not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the social security administration demanded a document excerpt from the commercial register, even if it would require officials from two Mausklicks can.
Thanks to the opinion poll is changing that now.
"The Czech social security administration will require in future, in controls by Sozialversicherungszahlern any extracts from the commercial register more," led by the Speaker from Jana ČSSZ Buraňová.
Meaning and purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of this year," is to take all the rules and orders under the microscope have to meet entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the nonsensical.
This is earlier this year for the fourth time, part of a business competition, from tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) organised and growing popular in the public eye.
If the three thousand people took part last year to participate in the vote, there were four thousand earlier this year.
No wonder, because there is still a lot of legal obligations which will only serve to hamper the business activity.
'Concerning, for example, the number of income tax forms, a take a front rank in the world, "Karel Havlíček of the constant association of small and medium businesses and industries driving the Czech Republic said.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity in the last few years is the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic, has improved, however.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic, is in relation to the company's 74. Conditions, compared to last year, an eight seats worse placement.
Competition absurdity of the year has been declared for the first time in years and takes place every year after the same script.
Everyone can speak from April until the print of the competition at the end of September of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To register the website address www.firmaroku.cz. serves after the organisers of competition seven candidates from addiction for the "anti price" and leaves the public online vote at the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It triumphs the absurdity, which receives the most votes.
To this year's survey of more than a hundred were more accurately reported 105 senseless rules and orders.
The clues come not only of entrepreneurs, but also by professional organisations and journalists.
Among the nominated, "Fina lists" of the competition rules are so that, for example, maintenance vehicles for motorways and fast roads have to pay tolls or that employers with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets must vorrichten every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the side of the competition.
The proclamation of competition each at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of Happenings, also regularly attend the leaders of the political and public life.
Eva Svobodová this year, the director of the association of small or means of constant company and industry driving the Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce the Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition were with, for example, of the game.
The state casts "where entrepreneurs's wheel, there can be no genuine economic recovery, it is therefore lift my goal, every year, at least 30 paragraphs, today's entrepreneurs or unnecessarily complicate their operations," stated Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The effort to create stupid orders from the world, to be effective.
In 2007 the people, the rankled most entrepreneurs driving duty imposed to the Gewerbeamt on the ground of their permanent factory three days in advance of the intention to report, with an exhibition to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation has been lifted by a revision of the trade law.
The duty, which, in 2007, the second largest number of votes - the obligation to notify the labour office missions by employees in size up to 30 days, was abolished by the law on it, what is known as "Green Card."
- and all good things come in threes.
On the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation was elected, which it imposed physiotherapists to have in Sprechzimmer are a mirror, a fridge and two Personenwaagen.
This regulation was reasonably by the Ministry of Health this year - mitigated the fridge duty was removed.
A new category recognises socially responsible firms
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education and sports projects
Already a novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition in the economic newspaper (HN), the category is "responsibility conscious company of 2010."
Basic idea of this competition is to encourage rational and fair enterprise.
"We want to support these companies, who are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and supporting socially responsible initiative," Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile telephone company Vodafon that Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, just as well as the competition, says "a rebel of the year."
For this year " s first annual decline this particular under category of the main competition Vodafon company of the year companies in school, for the success of not the only long term objective is.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough material for an independent.
Although it in regard to the subject of their work are diametrically opposed to their efforts, however, have a common denominator - support and consideration.
It is governance-challenged people, for example, because of personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among fourteen Fina lists from all over the Czech Republic the Prague software companies Et Netera appeared so, for example, which promotes the emergence not formal sports teams among their staff, who then participate in a number of tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible firm from the region is the society of Pardubice Isolit / Bravo, seventeen years has been the main sponsor of a Foundation funds for governance-challenged children.
A paper factory from Poděbrady exemplary their health care for disabled people, which account for 70% of its workforce, for which she was rewarded with the title of 'responsibility deliberate company in the region, Central Bohemia "; in competition Vodafone firm the year, documented it in the context of the region the third rank.
Olomouc in the region accounting firm MiRyz soft, introduced such a fluid and in addition to an average of 35 hours per week reduced working time and this without proportionate wage reduction won.
The jury award honorierte in the title, but also the fact that the company buy mainly in Czech manufacturers, citizens' initiatives supported in their surroundings and environmentally sound principles is working.
"We try to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business and administration for the environment is minimised," declared their business leader Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT companies Enlogit Ústí nad Labem from the region, which in turn cares about the health of its staff and that is why it has bought them on all grade Books ergonomische Tastaturen chair and, moreover, it promotes with their employees to work at home and in the actions they ring used companies carte services offered by a protected domestic garage.
"We also support the Foundation" to people in need "that the local gipsy Kommunität concrete aid," says Ondřej Suchý, the representatives of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company 'Praní a čištění is also' in Karlsbad region worth noting that contributes to their employees in the form of extra Bonussen to their pension.
"We give our employees contributions to the food, for the work, to increase their skills and for holidays Josef Strapáč by the construction company Czasch says," from Bruntál, the winners in the Mährisch / Schlesischen region.
Category responsibility conscious company of the year, all district Fina lists of competition were automatically registered Vodafon company of the year, which, the questions of the notification beantwortetet enclosed questionnaire and him zuschickten until 15.August the organisers.
Wrong please or incomplete answers in the questionnaire by the organisers were excluded from the assessment.
"If the representatives from the competing firms left unanswered questions, they were excluded from the competition" responsibility conscious company of the year, "in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, but they have not been disqualified so."
"A separate notification only to this competition is not possible, because he is the only one under the category of the main competition of the year, company, Karel Goldman from organising Agency declared," Bison & Rose.
Pilsner soil Fund - detention of the police in a public tender
In the building of the soil fund set up in Pilsen the anticorruption police made arrests in recent days.
The European media entrepreneurs and property traders Luboš G. was led away by Detektiven in handcuffs.
This had allegedly tried to manipulate public competition to take place for a just settlement of Restitutionsansprüchen so that the land in competition offered zufielen a specific bidder.
Luboš G. for this is to have half a million.
"At this moment I can only confirm that the police listened to a person because of the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Public Prosecutor of Pilsner newspaper Právo, "further details they could not in terms of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later of the 46 year old businessman from the police has been released again.
At how he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate, given the paucity of official information.
The Fund Lubomír Černá Speaker of the ground led to the question from Právo, the police have made in the Pilsner antenna of soil fund actually arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was a client, and not one of our employees," it explicit.
The public competition was held, according to Mrs Černá the correct description 'call for tenders by requirements on the transfer of land, in accordance with the law "and in cases in which a number of applicants offered bezeigen interest in the land.
"In the context of these persons offer call a higher value of their by the transfer to begleichenden Restitutionsansprüche, as proclaimed land value."
"According to the claims offered the sequence of the potential acquirer will be established, then the land fund the land transfer to the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund.
Luboš G. were obvious information available to anyone who had registered on the request, and as it was a legitimate person because he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a land interests that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Clearly against a big compensation.
It would also be a satisfactory explanation as to why he had to arrest him such a large amount of money.
Luboš G. had in the past, too good contacts, the Pilsner land fund.
So he played in the issue of the former head of the Soil Fund Václav Sankota a role that was prosecuted because he issued in Ersatzrestitutionen land on which location decisions on projects have already been taken.
Then Luboš G. acquired by the soil, for example, property funds, which were intended for the construction of public roads, to be precise, planned on the site of the construction of the commercial area pole Zufahrtsmagistrale Borské was.
Later, he continued these very favourably with the government against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, that the value of land far exceeded.
The town hall had to then small mixing heavy heart to jeopardise the construction not through the blocking of the land.
The housing of households rise by a few hundred per month
Budgets must from January not only with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and sewage charges and for heating and in some places even rents are growing.
Families must become so from January several hundred kronor per month more draw from the wallet than before.
Electricity is up to 4.6% more expensive, gas by 2% or more in some cities, we will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and more expensive in some places even the district heating supplies.
Only the electricity costs rise the housing households annually, some 100 kronor.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all of the main suppliers, to blame the clear support for the production of electricity from renewable sources is, namely from photovoltaic installations.
Gas is only moderately more expensive, but that is exactly when people heat most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, is to be expected, with a few hundred of kronor per year.
While electricity and gas across the Czech Republic will be more expensive, the price of heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger sites are planning price increases.
So to pay pay, for example, the budgets in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for district heating up to 50 kronor per month, more than 1,000 kronor per year in Liberec families.
The people of Prague, 9% higher water and sewerage charges threaten and this is the case, the city of increased infrastructure rent.
If the rent not change, there are only 6.8%.
Prague is part of the price compared to the whole, however, the Czech Republic will continue to be the lowest.
In Northern Bohemia, where the prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage charges at 7.4% are expected to rise.
Enormous rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental housing in which known as the rent regulation ended in January.
The housing company CPI Byty, which possesses in Ústí nad Labem 2500 homes, for example, is planning to increase the rents from January right about one hundred percent.
Anyone who does not agree with this rental increase, the wants to prosecute the company in court.
The regulated rents, which you pay today, or nearly 300,000 homes, next year is likely to rise by more than 10%.
Czech children to get drunk with Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once, even a good whisky, which has stolen the father from Hausbar.
These are the drinks, after benefiting drunken Czech teenager be notbehandelt under fifteen most frequently.
No exception are children who repeatedly ausschlafen their hangover in hospital.
This is apparent from the experiences of doctors, who will be faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments in hospitals.
"Beer or wine simply because it takes too long before it is drunk are totally out of fashion."
"Of today's trend is clearly of hard alcohol 'Luděk Pelikán, the chief doctor of the children's unit in the appropriations Hořovice Právo Bohemian clinic said.
"Whisky, if we manage to deprive the father from Hausbar a bottle, and, if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka does not have the advantage that they can mix it with the juice, then smell he so strong," said the chief doctor.
The Speaker of the school hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"Most common concerns Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools."
"Anecdotal it was also about slivovice, one walks away from home," which led Mrs Jurinová.
Chief doctor Pelikán, three or four of the ten year olds drinkers in the hospital admission have long been no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, in which he has been working for this year, he spent ten years in the hospital's ward Pädiatrie Motol, where ambulances ablieferten angetrunkene pupils from Middle and distance selling.
"A girl had to be allergic four times."
"Their career began with 12 years ago, when she was hospitalised for the first time, 3.5 per mille with alcohol in the blood, and in combination with" Extase "the doctor described," a particularly severe case.
"It was in the exhibition site in Holešovice in any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that there was no mention of their mother at all strange that their daughter was not 48 hours after the home," the chief doctor wondered.
It is precisely the lack of interest by parents or whose incredible tolerance infringed with the own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A genuine addiction in the true sense of the word, it is not, according to the experts, in children.
"Of alcoholism a longstanding chronic dependency is to be understood by the alcohol, and all related phenomenon, and this is not the case for these children."
Among those who repeatedly drink enjoy mostly a negative the family's social background, is typical, "chief doctor Pelikán declared.
Motol the spokesperson for the hospital, Mrs Jurinová, approximately 40 drunken children in the European medical department for children and young people were admitted by the middle of November.
However, only the cases with serious alcohol poisoning that made a hospital stay, a move in the statistics.
Drunk children, who are taken to ambulatory care by parents or, if necessary, by the police, not to be registered.
Except for cases where children austrinken only times as a bottle of spirits in a school desk, there is, in the opinion of Mr Pelikán Amplituden three year period, to the 100% reliance Walpurgisnacht is: That New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the bad certificate or for pleasure on vacation."
"I have already experienced Walpurgisnacht seven drink children at once in the opening," Doctor Pelikán stressed.
A betrunkenes child spend the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically, better off than a child who has to contend only the next day with a nasty hangover.
The headaches in the morning, on arising from Dehydration and the glucose deficiency, can sell it in hospital with an flüssigkeitsspendenden Infusion with glucose and nutrients that are absent the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, to raise them with good humour, without anything that hurts somewhere."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Doctor Pelikán acknowledges, it is polluting the patients at least it sometimes good humour, he will be listed in them the costs, the cost of treatment.
Because of transport with the ambulances and the night in an acute bed come good and to a few tens of thousand kronor.
"I sometimes have used this as an educational tool, if I have calculated directly to the children at the time of the visit, which has cost her drunkenness, and that it may well be that they have to work for the whole vacation on to earn the money for a single such Fete," Doctor Pelikán added.
His opinion, however, the health insurance companies are not after Regressverfahren, the demand in order to cure the necessary costs trunkenen children from parents.
Two training aircraft L's 159 for the first time, in foreign hands - in Spain
Two slight warplanes L's 159 out of a total of five, who has exchanged the Czech Ministry of Defense against the transport aircraft Casa C 295M, went on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville where the Spanish plane manufacturer EADS Casa - take up residence.
It is the first time that this type of machines are in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were to be seen so far only in exercises or air shows.
It concerns the airline able Zweisitzerversion L / 159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The rest of the three aircraft are einsitzige L's 159.
These are currently still einkonserviert Vodochody in reason, of the broker this business - the company Omnipol - has it taken last week.
Expediert aircraft when they physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
Einsitzigen fighter plane which L's 159, in turn, have been singled out for the long term and this stored planes without further deposits and investment on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry.
"The dual seat of L � 159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," said the newspaper Pejšek Právo.
He added that the army will not have to do without zweisitzige fighter aircraft, because the Ministry of Defence in May 2009, with reason Vodochody a 200 million contract on the renovation of four unnecessary signed L's 159 to the two seat voluntary version.
A new plane has accepted the army in July, the second it will, by the end of this year.
According Pejšek EADS has pledged to enforce the fighter aircraft in the equipment, one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty has stated very clearly that the company EADS is buyer of aircraft L's 159, and that these are for training pilots serve the NATO countries.
"It is, therefore, a matter of reality Abnehmers ways in which he the cause 'Pejšek quoted.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the L's 159.
Barter of five L's 159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
Tender at the time, the Ministry of Defence had to buy no tendering procedures, but EADS directly to language.
The former Defence office argued that this exchange will support the future export the L's 159 abroad.
Reason from the Czech army bought 72 machines, of which she spent only 24, wanted to sell it to the rest.
For the purchase of aeroplanes Casa will also have a legal process.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence is at the European Court of Justice because it would have the aircraft because a European call for tenders, and not have to choose by raising a single manufacturer.
The army has already adopted three aircraft Casa, the final should land within 14 days on the Airport Kbely.
A long finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men, whose finger is long, as the ring finger, are obviously exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
Is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is to do with the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of finger, can be used as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this is particularly among men by 60," which the study, said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The fingers could help to determine to what men should undergo necessarily a prostate cancer test, particularly genetic risks or other risk factors are, if available, such as health problems, added Mrs added family Eeles.
During the period from 1994 to 2009 with their counterparts in Britain had more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study of the finger of the right hand was shorter than ring fingers.
For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, and for 19% of those men whose vaccination and finger were equally long.
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring fingers, however, this risk has fallen by 33 per cent, in men by 60 even at 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two aforementioned fingers, which are already in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone is a long finger.
Previous research found that it is precisely this testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he was aware of this study, however, he does not think that the relationship between the length of finger, and the risk of cancer, so far, shown for "completely."
D1 and the Czech Republic in the snow - are closed D5
Just as the bulk of Europe, including the Czech Republic, is on Thursday morning under a snow blanket.
On the roads, and snow usually frozen Gehwegen who Winterdienstler were, in many cases the whole night at Axis.
The motorway between kilometres D5 89 and 90 toward Rozvadov is some accidents of lorries and cars because blocked and D1 in Brno towards Prague "is."
Dispatcher novinky.cz it said of the Central car Moto's clubs (ÚAMK).
In kilometres 91 a lorry sank 93 kilometres in two trucks clashed in this accident there are injuries.
Are also a couple of cars on the road.
There are also problems 185 kilometres of motorway D1 towards Prague.
Here, too, two lorries collided.
The drivers should leave behind Brno in kilometers 190 or go about Brno and harnessing in kilometres Kývalka 182 on the ground.
There is traffic jams form queues.
Also at D11 an accident happens and the same at the building to Prague.
In Prague a lie several centimetres thick snow and the temperature is minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autokolonnen are blocked, for example within Stadteil Prosek, Štěrboholská the road is absolutely.
The safest means of transport is in any case, the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example, on the line between Karl and peace.
At 8 a.m. the Prague crisis unit meets.
The railways and in the airport, there are problems.
The Czech state rail had to cancel because Schneeverwehungen seven fast rail links.
Problems there are, for example, by the wayside - or Prague Prague Kralupy - Beroun.
Travellers should inform themselves on the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyně is closed since Wednesday night, 11 p.m. until 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are only with greater caution beautiful.
At Vyškov three alongside roads are completely unbefahrbar, in the vicinity from Brno in places Schneeverwehungen form and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use higher Schneefräsen situated on some roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Where three roads are still blocked completely: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice Kučerov Šaratice - and also - Milešovice.
Here, too, we will have to use the snow clearance Schneefräsen.
When they again be beautiful, not to evaluate until now.
Hodonín caution in the region is in the area of white Carpathian the order of the day.
On the road, which should from nature protection reasons are diffused only with inerten Streumitteln, an up to five centimetres thick snow blanket of lies led ČTK.
Neuschnee in the Czech Republic, most in Northern Bohemia fell from two to ten centimetres - in places by 18 centimetres.
Mährisch Schlesischen region in the EU of 15 centimeters Neuschnee fell to.
In the Czech Republic, it listens but slowly to schneien.
American soldiers have a new 'smart weapon. "
American troops are deployed in Afghanistan for the first time, a new "smart" weapon, which has so far only under its code name XM 25 known.
The generals hope that these new automatic weapon affected the conflict with the Taliban, and the balance of power shifts in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a super accurate walnut.
Their projectiles are channelled namely by laser with an accuracy of just a few metres into the goal.
The particular missiles from bore 25 mm, which have been developed for this gun and high explosive bomb contained, function practically as small grenades.
The shells can be programmed, so that they can't just explode on impact on the target but at any given point of their ballistic path.
That means that we can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or the trench.
From above, it is not normally protected, the murderous steel cluster rain from above can put it so easy, apart from the battle.
Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM / 25, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon, the "intelligent" technologies to harness power.
"The soldier is basically as before: He reshape the goal in and sends a beam from the distance, so he gains a precise target point, after which the increase corner corrected, then he needs only abzudrücken.
"We say, they have measured 543 metres."
"If you abdrückt on invites the weapon and are shooting the Geschoss on distance 543 metres plus or minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs relocating
Fujitsu the company shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year with 400 staff will move their work of the previous office buildings on Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in Astro Park.
Japanese company Fujitsu shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computers and their maintenance specialist industries giant announced on Wednesday, men and women will be next July 400 transfer their work of the previous office buildings on Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in Astro Park, that is a big office complex in the Lyons road in Frankfurt Niederrad part of the city.
Fujitsu a spokeswoman explained, in the medium term, there should still be accommodated another 100 jobs of the group, which were previously spread across the region.
The rental supply was extremely attractive, in addition, the Greater Park offices in Astro, contrary to make the workings of the team better.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only tenants.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt / Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is just for a global companies, such as Fujitsu of great importance.
The latest move a major company in the region caused joy yesterday on disappointment among the winners and the losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, of a 'global player' was being won.
It was a "fantastic location commitment."
Fujitsu Pass to the city, the location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger mayor, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by managers about the intention.
"We have offered the company, of course, our aid ', Korwisi said.
The friendly contacts would, however, can do nothing about the difficulty of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the estate on Marienbader seat change.
Ultimately economic reasons would have been the deciding factor.
Now it seeks to prevent a long empty state in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building show cooperative."
Fujitsu previously used the house in the town hall square and the neighboring "Little vertical" were with the other buildings on Marienbader place ten years ago, to the most controversial building projects of Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private Projektentwicklers a new Stadtentree, this was both because of the massive development of previously partly as car park land, as well as the size of the buildings for criticism arose between station and town hall.
2001 related to the investment advisory and credit rating companies Feri that software manufacturers for travel distribution systems, launch Amadeus, and then computer manufacturer Fujitsu Siemens associated with the homes.
The Fujitsu buildings in 2006 was acquired by the Frankfurter German property opportunities Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and a year later, to the Spanish of Falcon Real Estate investments SA sold in Madrid.
Fujitsu based in Tokyo's Konuzern described itself as the third largest IT service providers in the world.
It provides companies, for example, computer and server and also makes the necessary service.
Establishment in the Rhine Main site is one of the largest in Germany, is, however, far more employees Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary is a Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt / Niederrad, the other subsidiaries on this location are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
This 7,000 square metres were in the office buildings Astro park hired.
In the twenty years old complex - the name alludes to its star shaped fundamental rift - has, among other things, of the Central Association Elektrotechnik- and electronics industries its headquarters.
Blocking Amazon - threats against Assange has servers
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service providers Amazon has consigned the revelation platform from its servers.
Possibly political pressure behind after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret US diplomatic cables diplomats.
WikiLeaks founder Assange has is supposedly in England.
The disclosure platform WikiLeaks machine in the United States increasingly under fire.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on, other countries and companies to boycott by WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has, is on the wanted lists of Interpol, after a newspaper report to stay in Britain.
"Wikileaks by Amazon server squeezed out."
"Free speech in the land of the free," with shared the Enthüllungs activists via messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet company Amazon had banished the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had used for the publication of the secret diplomatic diplomatic cables to the Amazon Web services (AWS), in order to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks via Twitter to the step further declared: 'Fine - our dollar spent now to employ people in Europe. "
If Amazon have such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop trying to sell books."
Amazon have stopped using its servers by WikiLeaks after staff from Senator Joe Lieberman had made enquiries, the television channel CNN reported, citing the Office Liebermans.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened with a boycott, the British "Guardian reported."
"I would have liked to see Amazon is taking this action in the light of previous publications earlier classified information by WikiLeaks," the senator said.
Lieberman called, meanwhile, to deny the platform in other countries the use of servers.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, hideous and thuggery puts our national security at risk and threatened lives around the globe," it was analysed in a communication of the French party senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign, should assist WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange has, which is being sought for the rape of suspicion of the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list by Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent "Great Britain does the 39 years Australians in on the precise location is Scotland Yard known.
The Internet activist has described the investigation in Sweden as intrigue of his opponents.
Kristinn Hrafnsson WikiLeaks spokesman said in London, there have been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange has."
Assange has rightly therefore fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to keep themselves hidden.
Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible should be prosecuted for the WikiLeaks disclosures because of treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, said - apparently ironic - on television, Assange has "should be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange has a dispute arose in the meantime.
The Speaker of the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if she is for newly reported spying 'calls on diplomats responsible.
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," as Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy, and the interests of this country are far more important than his a website."
The American Government now protect their data banks fully to the test.
As a special envoy of the deputy director of the Centre for measures to combat terrorism to Russell Travers, was appointed, told the White House.
Travers is responsible "to develop the necessary structural reforms," which had become the message after the disclosure reports by WikiLeaks.
The White House should also examine ways, such as the entire government to exchange information and protects.
The US Government also announced, to ensure the safety of dissident and most active, should they fall by the Wikileaks' publication in danger.
"We have done everything possible to come in contact with them," foreign office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready, they should protect, if that will be needed."
The ice University
The "Gelato University in Bologna Eiskonditoren on better seasons to be prepared.
The three days of basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from around the world.
Where, in fact, the entire ice?
By Gelatiere Gelataio and from.
The Gelatiere, in German something old-fashioned the Eiskonditor, establishes the cream, following all the rules of Italian ice art master.
The Gelataio pulls with a Spachtel the ice cream from Kühltheke, it deletes the Waffel and sold them.
Order to know this, you need not travel after Anzola dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who would like to know more about the ice, the past is not of the "the Gelato University" the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice University has set up, the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from their machines everywhere will be the senior Italian ideals.
The three days of basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from around the world.
But there are also more day Spezialkurse Schokoladeneis around lost and internships Eisdiele in the house of their own.
Some dreams in the mid 'Crisis of a new career, others venture just the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations.
This time there are 40 players from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the Slow food movement and want to offer in the country's industrial Ice Cream in the future, a European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is enterprise adviser and wants eintüten after years in an irritating job gone.
Two young Egyptians dream to open in Cairo a Eisdiele.
A man from Malta and a from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in its bars - and the Canadian House, Mrs Julia, because their children Italian love ice cream.
Maestro � Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari says the participants initially the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
Essential good taste is not only, but also the consistency seidige fluidity and the good.
Luciano forgets during his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen On construction: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is plenty of is romanticism."
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano dump the basic ingredients of the milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, with an electronic programme all heated to 85 degrees and then immediately to four degrees are cooling.
Then it is the machine a Hahn, and out comes a pasteurised white Basiscreme, basis Milcheissorten for all.
Immediately the lecturer will almost bombarded with questions: Can we create ice cream only with natural substances without stabilising influence?
How can we ignore the own Experimentierlust free rein?
Luciano warns to lead from the spirit of the time.
Who of ice cream "just from natural ingredients' talk, has spent perhaps yet stabilisers - usually a natural product such Guarkernmehl from Guarbohne.
Of course, one can produce without ice, stabiliser, only then it must be sold within a day, otherwise it together sackt in, and the customer to louder Eiskörnchen bites.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Exciting it will with the flavourings.
For the flavour in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which you buy in the fruit's department or by the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are are powder and Pasten.
"The suppliers will try all they try to foist onto you dozens of aromatic additives."
"But you should simply experimenting."
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or on the ice cream out of the white primary mass, with eggs to yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis of all kinds of chocolate for the temptations offered.
Now the course participants must Eismaschinen.
Luciano can establish they each have four different kinds of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and hazelnuts would / ice, with or without egg in basic mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment also undergo the Fruchteissorten.
Added flavourings, more fruit geschmacklich mashed potato - that is not necessarily better.
Hazelnuts would / ice not necessarily more tastes nut if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular and the kiwi fruit ice provides the working group which used more fruits, less water and less.
Only a balanced mixture highlight the taste a Gelato correctly, Luciano says.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Used peach and mashed potato with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the basic recipe to be reduced.
For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed.
Luciano, it draws a device with which he intended the sugar content of the fruit varieties (growers) judge the Oechsle in grape must.
Fortunately tables facilitate the calculation.
To make ice no longer require so much physical use as before.
Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps.
There is also a device, in which the final mixture of ice and at the same time, and is beaten cremig cooling to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation from not remain small mishaps.
Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues of course covered itself from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than getting him the colossal hand blenders out of control.
"At any rate," Maestro Luciano says that "it is only a matter of time before something happened."
In the twilight zone controllers
The European Food Safety Authority of Efsa is infiltrated with experimental Genpflanzen industry.
This accusation now put the expert group test Biotech, which sees itself as independent Institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said test biotech boss Christoph Then Wednesday in Munich.
Efsa the head of the group's experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper and another expert, Efsa were for years now the lobbyists' association Ilsi under contract.
Will be paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper have contributed significantly to the extension to Genpflanzen Efsa's and am in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
Efsa regulations that are selling fashion word equal with position papers of Ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, which is expected to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is the second time that test Biotech share your criticism of a conflict of interest.
So was an senior Efsa's Managerin recently without conditions or transitional period the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta, and the sides have changed.
Also the Central German radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal links between kontrollierender EU authority and industry lobby what that environmental federal office has made, as well as EU parliamentarians sit up and take notice.
Efsa, however, which can see no conflict of interest.
We will repeat every serious data back, even to those of the industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality, it said in a statement.
Of the experts working for Efsa, they do not demand that they have no links with the industry.
But they would have to disclose.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This for experts in science, industry and politics described himself as a neutral forum, among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying contract.
In the matter of independent experts as Then criticise that genetically modified crops are currently authorised without any attempt to feed animals, and the response of Genpflanzen will not be tested on environmental influences.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn is on the field," said Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze what should talk briefly about no reliable results.
"If you do not, the risk of addiction, how should we then find it? 'Asks pointed Then.
Angelika Hilbeck also sees it.
The scientist research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is trying in this area, as in the US, now to influence or to discredit in Europe ever more critical scientists.
There was therefore hardly even researchers, which are intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies were not published in the rule.
"Industry controls the security research," claimed Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has concerned itself which, in total, approximately 400 kg.
On Monday evening it was Stuttgart power station, the Tuba on the back.
Demo it was.
It was snowing.
History is well known: In September the dredging were angerückt and had started to cut a big piece of the north wing.
Stuttgart the world was no longer the same, thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions Tieferlegung of the railway station.
When it came to a settlement freeze, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Shattered in 6,000 to 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer produce a soft rough stone, mortgaged between 1914 and in 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a couple of scraps.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"They must not be allowed to disappear."
He schwärmt: "A cheaper and of poor brick, simply and earth."
As he aufsägte one that smelled after Zigarettenqualm.
What he will do with the slice, he does not yet know.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads in a forest in Tübingen in a former Munitionsdepot the French army where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
Is the 44 people with old stones.
He has bought all, which fell on the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace, it would to Schotter gemahlen or the landfill disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once an Wachhäuschen.
Insulted and threatened you have him, he tells, as in September in the newspapers that he had purchased the leftovers of the north wing of the demolition business.
But he has talked with the S � 21 opponents, for several days.
And he has told them that he but now nothing could for the demolition.
And if it is, then it would be the most sensible, if the stones reused.
Around 200 S 21 opponents with subsequently took, on average, one of the 80 kilograms heavy Quader, piece price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but also some in the hope of being able to return to him in a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 large lorry loads.
Half still being stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
They were coming from everywhere and weggeschleppt would have to bear as boot and supporters.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have turned themselves into "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Would not be the political component."
He is rising in his SUV, a Tour by 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura he has studied and broken, later biology, then he has taken an interest in computers and is now finally stone dealer.
And rock lovers.
40000 tonnes of bricks store it.
From across Germany he together karrt its treasures.
He says that he is the greatest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He is slowing down.
The snow art full behauene sand stones lie.
"They once belonged to Dresden Marienbrücke," he told them.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he schwärmt.
"My Lieblingsstein."
It is the way high through the forest.
He shows on a bunch: Red limestone, previously part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And further.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once Quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadions.
Throughout the snow bricks and stories Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police Bureau rötlicher stone is complemented with from the Dom St Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner hospital.
What work, the effort, the sweat.
If Rongen to think about how the stones were moved earlier and hands hacked with simple bottle features horse and cart, he will most reverential.
"It would be a scandal if they so schreddern something."
Reich, he has not become rich alone.
Employs 14 people, but the stone dealer today, moreover Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and horticulturalists have established at the top of the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying" Resteverwerter says.
Soon he must after Cologne.
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
Talents struggle with high potential
There is active run on Buffett.
16 students push for salmon rolls, tomato soup and Süßes.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car makers Volkswagen invited the machinery works and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas they will together fachsimpeln with VW developers about the car of the future, and incidentally Volkswagen.
In the competition for the finest minds, many companies now go in Nahkampf and inform, as VW, in cooperation with the university.
Their mission: To recruit the smartest graduates as early as possible in the Hörsälen before they are coming on to the labour market and is being courted by another.
And because the universities do not supply data on the performance of their students, trying to spot the exceptional talents in practice projects and to bind itself.
On the second day of workshops to tu Braunschweig car company advertises at the talent.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed pen, wine gum and Mappen with VW logo.
It tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the company.
Nico Selle the tu Braunschweig cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and the experience."
"VW cannot know at the same time, students go themselves interesting candidates closer and consider who would be as employees in question."
Such cooperation, Selle, are not unusual.
Newly that so aggressively around the students gebuhlt will be.
Otherwise, "the focus more on the technical project was', Selle says.
The struggle for fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many industries, the companies will not be able to choose their staff more from a large flock of candidates.
But they must extol balzen and particularly for highly skilled workers.
Mainly graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October over 40,000 engineering posts vacant.
And the engineering gap will be according to VDI's forecasts are even greater.
For the audit and consulting firm KPMG is novel Dykta on the talent hunt.
He organised to elaborate Recruiting's events such as KPMG's Race, a kind of modern with trails, where the participants using GPS coordinates find their way.
Eight promising students wants to send the company so next year, across the United States.
KPMG and incidentally, the participants can see branches and get to know the company.
Who can, in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flies in the United States.
The slashing and burning the high potential in the universities to the artillery Dykta ever more loudly.
"We want to set ourselves apart with the Race from the mass."
"Just a simpler Segeltörn was too little."
For talent hunters Dykta seems embroiled the bill.
"We have to date, with all participants a similar action in the last year."
Some are "nearing completion and want to apply soon to be with us," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhlen on campus, especially small and medium sized enterprises are also in quite classic measure prowled on the profession.
Graduates "we are trying to achieve at technical measure."
"Around on the inter solar 'Sitha Stübe, staffing leader in solar technology manufacturers solar World reported.
The Bonn company employs around 500 staff in Germany.
Stübe know about the offspring.
Currently 35 posts are advertised on the company website.
"It is very difficult to fill vakante positions."
"That costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on Uni's professors.
Solar World is cooperating with various universities, such as the university in free mountain.
"The professors give indications that we can make work experience placements or write his thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not needed for solar specialists.
To ensure the company attempted with other virtues to promote: Personal atmosphere flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"I cannot offer a large corporation, often" personnel head Stübe says.
Money is not long discouraged more the main role.
Flexible working times, child care or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solar World documented in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute to the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute produced an annual best list of German employers.
It consulted staff as they satisfied with their work and their Jobumfeld are and look at the conditions of the workers.
Personnel head Stübe also plus points in Jobsuchenden hopes of the placement.
"I think that the candidate look particularly after external evaluations on a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of Deutsche Employer branding academy advises companies that want to build up with a long term strategy a good reputation as an employer.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means that under the Kriegler, particularly internal measures.
"The best way to make themselves attractive as employers, leads on its own staff," he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal Employer says branding, so employers brand education within its own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat its people well and they identify with the companies, they would naturally selling to friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"This is like a game with ties," Kriegler says.
Obama new drilling stop
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be in the next few years, no new oil drilling.
Such a ban enacted by the government in Washington, and revoke its previous plans for good.
Even before the Atlantic coast remains prohibited new drilling for the time being.
This told the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for this strict ban, which is at least for the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident that claimed the lives of 11 workers and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama has signaled to pressure from the opposition and the industry is its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Advocates want to reduce the dependence of the United States from oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, has not yet been resolved.
At the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP, is facing billions of demands.
An inquiry on behalf of Obama's is to come up with in the course of 2008 its results.
In October Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the following the explosion Bohrstopp imposed.
Following various oil companies had put applications for new Bohrvorhaben immediately.
With tighter control and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
Currently, the competent authority is concerned, which was reeling after numerous corruption charges brought into disrepute, will radically reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne.
The industry warns would now publicly warning that the output fall in the Gulf by a stricter regulation, much smaller than in the past.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy BDO - before Bohrverbot by Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance complains and the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what is precisely the regulatory change."
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is torched
The water in the rivers has ölbraun, it looks like at the pump: Ausgelaufenes billion litres of crude oil have destroyed the natural in Ogoniland in Nigeria.
The people live by theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it well.
"Haunts you are not," reassured the eco activist the journalists: "You will still get enough oily slime before the lens."

"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger to the health '.
The war analogy is appropriate.
The municipal area of the Ogoni is a disputed battlefield for decades: The first one from Europe Explorateure burst more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance here had to the Shell company organised adapt in the 1980s, later executed with the writer Ken Saro Wiwa in 1993, his production because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Still today is the company return Ogoniland denied: While from the whole of the delta region of three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 Bohrquellen and seven thousand kilometres of pipelines every day, more than two million barrels of the black gold being pumped, are the oil fields in Ogoniland fallow to unstable is the corporation the situation.
All ends few hundred metres of steel Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" are called the heads of the boreholes too zärtlich.
They are up to 50 years old, most korrodiert to its core.
Always such a Bohrkopf breche apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream rinne crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres spilled in 50 years, according to estimates by experts into the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the amount of oil, as at the time of the shipwreck of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea off Alaska became - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the persistent organic MCA responsible, it is argued.
While the Shell Power corporate sabotage and the organised Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible, environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe lecke pipelines and see as the main culprit.
Shell in Nigeria to attach much lower safety standards as elsewhere in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: The rate of defects of the lines was "much higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte workshop outdoors are appearing from the mangroves figures: They are cluster naked and ölverschmiert up to its neck.
Under one of the many cellars, which are partly connected with tubes to locate dispersed sometimes arbitrarily on the site, a fire flackert: An illegal refinery.
In the barrels of the crude oil on the fire will several hours long inflamed passions, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First petrol through the pipes into Auffangtopf, later headed kerosene and diesel, spits out in the end.
So Michael and four staff on a daily basis, up to four barrels produce diesel à 300 litres, "which brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria have only a single refinery.
Those with barely 40 euro cents per litre of ridiculously low price of diesel can undercut the illegal Kocher: Because of their commodity they get for nothing.
It comes from "Bunkerern" that the pipeline network to tap across Ogoniland: In this way, will be lost to the country as a whole, according to experts in the Niger Delta every day at least 16 million litres of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisional fashioned methods between raw material being stored illegally, however: The bulk fill organised criminal networks which politicians and senior military officials are to also include, in tankers and dispose him on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is due to the activities of the people or the lax production, believes that the activist Akpobari for purely academic.
The oil companies "would not be perceived as invaders and they had destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen not as thoroughly, there were neither sabotage or theft and illegal mills."
Now the ratio of the Ogoni was would destroy Shell but, above all, to the extent that a withdrawal of the company calling only: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better."
Since Michael nervous.
"High time that it disappears," says the muskulöse Ölmann.
Can come "every minute the soldiers."
Illegal Ölveredler of the special forces are caught, they are no arrest, but a painful bribes.
Also the north come mainly from the country want - as soldiers all Nigerians - benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover hazardous construction defects in A380 � engines
Of the A380 has apparently a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered in the investigation of a possible construction defects notgelandeten machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine from the case."
The airline Qantas now wants to take the engine manufacturers.
Notgelandeten the passengers from the Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November and seems to have had much more luck than hitherto known: The Australian aviation safety authority found in their investigation a major security problem with the engines of some A380 machine - and now warns against a possible construction defects.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: A Ölschlauchverbindung fatigue cracks and leaks he could produce, it said in a statement published on this Thursday ATSB of authority.
This would have to be "a catastrophic engine from case" can lead.
Affected by the Rolls Royce engines manufactured in 20 aircraft, the A380's number.
Including Qantas / Airbus, had to notlanden on 4 November in Singapore is located.
The Australian airline has now begun legal action against the UK turbine manufacturers.
They filed a complaint in an explanatory statement, Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allow him further legal action against the company.
Qantas' chief Alan Joyce said that his airline will demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
In the fire the engine parts solved and the wings were damaged.
A Rolls Royce has been an oil fire as a cause for the damage.
After the incident must be replaced now around the world, up to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the Superjumbos equipped with the affected train stations.
The safety recommendation was the result of a cooperation with the Rolls Royce, ATSB said spokesman Martin Dolan.
The problem of security was deemed sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency evacuation of the Qantas Machine the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines has about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa from changed in an A380 as a precautionary measure, the train station.
The doppelstöckige flyer is the largest passenger airliner in the world.

German bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to dissociate itself from her true sign, according to a newspaper report the money home buyers looking for two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros, the property could bring.
The Deutsche Bank has only just made their company headquarters function: The Twin Towers in Frankfurt banking quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to go back to their old job back.
But now the financial company wants to extract the cost of the renovation seemingly back - and the two large houses is looking for a buyer, as the "Financial Times Deutschland, under appeal writes to a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale not called the spokesman.
"We always consider whether it makes more sense to hold or sell real estate, and subsequently zurückzumieten," he said.
So that Germany's biggest credit institution is its headquarters after a short period of time.
The Bank had the twin towers until the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros by investors of a house of their own funds and then refurbished costly.

Thousands grieve for dead buddy
More than 10,000 people of verschütteten miners have thought in New Zealand, which were announced after several explosions in a mine for dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered, because the security situation in Unglücksschacht is more precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, it was in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62 years ago have been killed under days.
A tube had been descending in Unglücksschacht left, but had found no sign of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions were able to dig any rescue forces for security reasons.
After the second violent blasts authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the mates more.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends reminded with a commemoration of the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered in radioactive sunshine in Greymouth, New Zealand, on the South Island.
Remained silent for two minutes.
Verschütteten miners to honor the 29 tables were set to see on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddy were.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes and Surfbretter, found their place here.
Against the government of the country's buildings the flags flying at been flying at half mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners' from the depths of the earth 'would come back to the surface, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said on the participants of the ceremony.
"But they have never come home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son, as long as he had not seen his body, Lawrie Drew said, whose son, Zen has been buried in the pit.
Alongside the Prime Minister and members of the victims of a number of foreign diplomats attended the ceremony.
In the first explosion on 19 November miners were also been killed by British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began to extinguish the fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases will be replaced, beginning with the fervent herunterzukühlen temperatures inside the mine, police, President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Splatter fits the art of cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is testing with his fighters' epic poem "Rising Walhalla" old genre's borders.
To what audience of the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn may have thought, as he "spun Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Vikings' warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberated from its Peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces, piles his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action just because, like our hero used thuggish killing methods, and his foes just usurping the Gedärme from the vibrant body, if he has a bad mood.
Einauge, on the other hand, as he is called, in fact, says that the whole of the film about a word, and the other characters can stoop to more than just one or two sentences or a few agonizing death scream.
Otherwise, remains silent and feasted upon the gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland the Wikingerwelt of around a thousand years ago, provides the backdrop.
Ideal rather adult Cineasten for Existentialismus with interest and very quiet camera for journeys.
Fine, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are not mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealers / trilogy "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, stoically refuses, however, to make his plants with a little more humor the mainstream or slightly less brutality the Arthouse accessible.
Most arts cinema's friends should themselves from around the Gedärmen spritzenden brain mass and deter.
The action fans die, then, at the latest before boredom if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons way with the force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity in doldrums and fog is caught before the team is obviously in America and where further remains silent.
No wonder that Walhalla Rising "in Germany has" found no cinema's lending and now seemed only on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also behind the façade has until prätentiösen bluttriefenden, because hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film, it is not a question of dialogue or a stringent action, it is anything atmosphere, a film as a fever dream.
And for which there is no escape for the viewers.
Refn hardly takes him a moment of relaxation and to pack him with its icy and dark images blossom and style very slowly (Sound track each other's throats, but especially with the incomprehensible hatred which badge him from the heart of the players.
Only a small blonder boy Einauge is faithful to the side, maintained something as innocence, all others are driven by rage.
Einäugige most of all the hero, whose motives are never explained, but enemies temporary allies and eventually for warriors from the hell will, perhaps to the Ambassador of the devil himself.
He means destruction, but perhaps for only the already Verdorbenen.
"Rising Walhalla" is one of the more puzzling film, one can admire and hate, Ärgern, Aufregen and astonished.
An experience.
Unexplained Erdarbeiten
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to comment on that - there to be controls.
Against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F / 15 I fighter aircraft are attacking a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, but the next major city, 30 kilometres away is as the Saur Dair.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has allegedly being built with help from North Korea in which Quader, hidden in a valley, which departs from the electricity.
According to a briefing of the US abroad CIA secret service by the end of April 2008, were also under the name of the nearest town of Al Kibar reactor's expression was in a good position to produce plutonium - were from building nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, however, is the technology from their fifties.
The CIA conducted a video presentation above with fuzzy satellite images.
Per Computeranimation they ignored, where what components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, a copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center had fell.
They also presented photographs that show the buildings, from near or even the Home Area.
The reactor was stood on the eve of the operation, it was said to have been drawn up but even with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was then, of course, the mystery was in time rather greater.
Former US President George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was above the offensive is fairly sure that Syria's Al Kibar in building a reactor, but very little evidence was that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme."
Some intelligence officers in Europe rather more cautious, and there are still only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA to keep the presentation of "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have been a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied only in the summer, neatly, the IAEA has "to provide enough material for questions."
The rubble of the alleged 'unused military building "surpassed the Syrians may hurry and planierten the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen was in June 2008, in el the Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received a Member State commercial providers of satellite images from the period immediately after the attack, which is likely to be stronger than the one presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to get on the market, because of the unknown purchasers - perhaps Israel has - they bought the exclusive.
, the IAEA therefore cannot verify their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed, never run a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor.
The uranium has come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the dismissed the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss the issue - just as on the satellite images.
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el the Kibar and access to the ruins of bombed-out building.
But also Israel remains silent.
"We will comment on this never," most recently at the time of the attack by acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reiterated the official position.
So the investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 in vain and "Authority is becoming a serious credibility problem for," as one senior Western diplomat gives at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, finally, a grave violation of the NPT in the room is, the watchdog, the IAEA.
As key to making progress in the investigation the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions that are "functional link" with the alleged reactor, and unlike this still exist.
The inspectors have neither disclosed which assets are, nor what role do they have or what they does seem suspicious.
According to the German newspaper they are called internally with the IAEA than Marj as Sultan, the Masyaf Iskandariayah and, in turn, derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and made on satellite images to find a building complex Masyaf, which is one of the most likely suspect objects.
It is probably in or just next to a military base - exactly this statement denied Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the US, auszuspähen at military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become by a typing of the US secret services at the facilities.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, and was being transported between the three locations Quader on the Euphrates and the material.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the production of fuel."
Although there were "no indications on sensitive activities" uranium enrichment and reprocessing, and processes that are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is enriched.
But where the uranium would have to come from, and where it later, the plutonium should be separated for the bomb, to these central issues there are at most plausible assumptions.
Unclear whether debris that could offer valuable trace, were stored in three places.
As disappeared were the hundreds of lorry loads from the face of the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble remains.
The only a few kilometres from el the Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al / Tibni, which Syria has investigated in 1998 on their suitability as the storage of radioactive waste, and the IAEA is unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images on the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review brought in contact with the reactor.
Admissions from the orbit show but that Syria carried out on three suspect places Erdarbeiten and large container remote after the IAEA has asked for access.
This may be a coincidence, but has contributed little to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles to the IAEA have spent many months on a plan for inspections there shows to develop, it should allow Syria to respect any military secrets - the effort alone how much is in the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus is bügelte even this proposal.
Western diplomats were allayed in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter have no great urgency, is approximately US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' special through inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority, at the controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would propose these inspections, has already "a option, for which I am in the future 'spoken, but he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs to ensure a majority of the board of governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented are eager to do anything else than an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat, to bear in mind are: "What if they get in the end nothing?"
Love in times of war,
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer has started to work on her first appearance, still nameless auspices, there is trouble.
The script they have written themselves, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We do not know much more about it, but that is enough to cause trouble.
Stubbornly the rumour is that the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the Yugoslavian war in her Serb rapist.
Bosnian women's organisations have protested immediately, after which some people in Sarajevo planned Drehtage were transferred to Hungary in the short term.
Now the film is off in Hungary and in the post production, but there are still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN's refugee agency UNHCR on Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported Jolie - is itself now Ambassador to the United Nations refugee agency.
Diplomatically it is not - it has offered the women before weeks ago at a meeting in Hungary, which rejected it.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not been there, and Jolie attitude towards the victims her not enough about the script.
Their organisation has recommended to the UN refugee agency, to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reported.
But what exactly has written Jolie for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read your script, has granted after some ups and downs a Drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie was not then anyway.
The young author even claims to have no political intentions with their film, have worked with a great deal of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, the terrible consequences of war, wanted to show and give all the parties involved have a voice.
The content of it, however, remains vague.
So a second Synopsis a film circulating on the web, then, sounds quite different: The lovers knew it even before war and will meet again, as it will, a Bosnian Muslim, trafficked into a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard.
What is considerably different sounds when the variant "rape victims verknallt in torturer."
That Jolie film actually begins even before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation."
Can now provide their well only hackers by Hollywood peace: By providing the script, as so many before, illegally into the grid.
Nothing as away here
This evening there is finally right again around for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
To ensure the home team dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans johlen before pleasure in krachend louder music, they stampfen with their feet.
The Bailey's pub in the southern Irish Cork does, because the players to throw table tennis balls on a three metres - and distance in beer cup hit.
"Beer pong" called the bizarre spectacle to win there are 500 euro victory premium plus airline tickets to Las Vegas beer pong for the World Cup in January.
Cian Tanner is a calmer type; this shrill Trinkspiel and the restrained IT professionals, this does not really fit together.
Yet the 26 people is trying to amuse, to divert attention away from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
On his plan not game fun is in Las Vegas, he will lead in January bid talks in New Zealand.
"I have an uneasy," he says.
"It is so far away from home, and I have no work there."
Nevertheless, his friend in Auckland is waiting for him, "they had it agreed, in a flash than their Wunschjob Eventmanagerin, may be a good sign," the young man says and is smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home already two of Tanners three sisters who have sought their fortunes abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, who is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: How on the Tanners it looks in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the short term, experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin ESRI forecasts.
Until 2015 they expect even 200,000 immigrants.
This small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants for a heavy loss.
Materialize the forecasts, there is an immigration wave comparable with those in Ireland in the 1980s, suffered.
After a decade of the boom, which has brought great prosperity for the Irish, now us once again is gaining ground.
Uncertainty the economic crisis, in particular the young, well educated people of Ireland, for whom it was previously, only uphill.
Jobverlust and social decline seemed in the boom years of absurd.
Everyone was needed, money was there in abundance.
Now, but three out of ten men and women under 30 are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are countless reader letters of young immigrants, who complain: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country will lose a whole generation '.
"The last person is then ask the light."
Jura / student Leanne Caulfield, President the Irish students union, does raise a bleak future, because the Government is legislating only window dressing and young people a future offer more.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy, such as new jobs are to be created," says 20 year olds.
They watched how their fellow classmates move from one unpaid internship to the next.
Their greatest concern, they say, it should be in four years even having to emigrate.
"This idea is a sad and depressing."
While men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organised "WorkingAbroadExpo," a mass, which is a general service on the subject of work abroad.
"For business is to make the labour abroad but a great opportunity, the first steps on the career ladder," the manager says.
On its website site photographs show in Australia, and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: No Galeerendienst is working abroad, but freedom and fun leads.
How it feels to build elsewhere, Seán O 'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because it had to do so for the 29 years of engineering in Ireland, and nothing more, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction in Germany.
They high draw in Gelsenkirchen took just a fashion house.
In January, it is further to Hanover or Berlin, on to the next project.
His country sees O 'Donovan now only rarely, since he makes extra classes to the credit for abbezahlen his house at home.
"The situation is a little bit crazy," he says, as it comes after a long time, for the first time, on the eve of his home.
"I earn money in Germany on a house in Ireland where I am as good as never more."
He laughs rather move and goes through ausgekühlte spaces.
The little house is on a fine with leafy residential front gardens, park in Einfahrten big, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O 'Donovan has bought the house for four years for 380 000 euros - credit funded 100%.
"There were crazy times, there was easy money, without a lot of questions," he says.
He is afraid that it could go wrong with the credit?
O thought Donovan for a while, to pour hot tea and says: "I have no children that I feed must and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The structural engineering may not the complaints, which he listens often at the moment.
"No one should starve our situation is, but not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"A while working abroad, this is not the worst thing that could happen - maybe we feel it only as Irish."
He laughs and then told by his father, who has moved in the last great economic crisis, to England.
"After seven years ago, he was back, and life went in Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner like this idea.
Leaving the future and look just as it is with the living elsewhere.
A couple of years working in London, he was already behind them and why it should go in New Zealand, is not good for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one thing that worries him, posing in those days: The ceremony on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could in a goodbye party get out.
"Just a lot of emotion, not to say," he and drink a great Schluck from his beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds scary."
"We loosely call it a rather Weggehparty, quite, with a few friends, a few drinks, a couple of games."
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States.
Latinobarómetro to the results of the survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey is carried out regularly since 1995 and shows so the exchange of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's poll in September and October, particularly in's eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America.
And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries on the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has increased sharply (beyond table 1).
In Peru the number of democracy advocate of 40%, for example, where each year since 2002, the economy is growing at around 6%, rose in 2005 to 61% this year.
Recovered in Mexico, where the economy, since the sharp drop in the last year, such a trend is to see.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, is convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (beyond graph are 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they would be satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress 45% of their country and their government. Both values equivalent to those of the last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%.
A decade, Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts for more democracy.
That this lasted during the world economic crisis, might be that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery.
Moreover, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social network.
(According to reports of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, this week rose from 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America, only slightly and has fallen this year by 32%.)
But from country to country, there is a strong mood beyond differences diagram (4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been reflected in a widespread progress thinking.
Increased in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was felt more and violent crime, this is less the case.
Only the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents see in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than in the unemployment graph (say 5).
Approximately 31% say that they themselves, or a family member in the last year were either victims of a crime, yet compared to 38% in the last year have fallen, the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995.
Rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the private and of market economy: Around 71% of respondents on Regional said that the private economy is essential for development, in 2007, there were (graph) 56% say 6.
Approximately 58% said that the market economy can only express their country progress, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents have maintained in Venezuela this view (and 80% are) for a private business, although their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalised many private companies.

The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see in the United States the most influential country, although this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be taken over.
A electoral defeat
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts in some cases exceeded the fears of election workers who rushed to the aid of the beleaguered country, by far.
Overcrowded polling box repeatedly votes cast, ballot papers in Rinnstein, destroyed local elections and intimidation were the only part of the problems.
With polling stations opened hours of long delay.
Many Haitians, many of which by the earthquake had become homeless in January, walked off with around in search of a choice.
Some tasks after all, quite.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leader, demanded as a result of an alleged fraud, the abolition of the election results.
Across the country, there was sometimes violent protests.
Nevertheless called Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as fairly well in many respects."
According to a cautious statement from observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities may be so seriously they not make the process necessarily unlawful."
, in other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is ostensibly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, committed, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jewish Célestin, with voters little or no support, declares the Wahlberhörde the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic, and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, was feared a low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians have been prevented by a lack of organisation of the vote.
Shortly before election beginning 250,000 cards, which are needed for election were not around, distributed yet.
There is a great deal at stake.
Donors consider a legitimate, government, which is recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband of Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, the driving their popularity rate by 20 points at about 50% upwards learned; this is the highest value since its election in 2007.
Its but that in the next year into a reelection, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is entertain a compromise than her late husband that her predecessor and political partners, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who drew even after the election of his wife, the economic policy, made often budgets, which take into account the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation, not full.
This allowed the President some to spend the extra revenue as it pleases.
On paper, the Fernández government lost in the last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rally behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where an parliamentarian another in the face and other government of bribery accused) managed the Congress, not to approve the budget for 2011.
"I am not going to discuss it," the President.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, allowing the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is hot: They probably will grow this year by up to 9%.
The official inflation z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and salary demands of the trade unions - pushing up the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who has been beset it took office in 2003, when Argentina from economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not lowering inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector and has singled out for bullying as his säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census Indec, subsequently schönte the official inflation statistics.
Mr Fernández now we can take?
It has called on the private economy and trade union leaders to talks.
According to official statements and wage increases are to be limited in the next year to 18%.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a big devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández would possibly why Argentina join financial economically to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the Government made an agreement with shareholders who had rejected the previous restructuring of the country in 2001.
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to urge, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had rejected a review by the IMF, as is the custom elsewhere, always.
But in the last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou announced that the fund will be in the process of drafting a new national consumer price index "technical assistance." It seems that the first step would be to the cleansing of Indec.
It is not known whether Mr Fernández will be after the end of its term, even without the support of her husband is politically active.
If so, they need to get the support of the middle class, which has largely Kirchnerism enough.
If the Argentines return in March from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie, which was shown to her, will be largely fizzled.
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to lift many political decisions quietly to her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are approaching slowly closer link to the mainland.
Which considers Taiwan by its big brother across the Straits?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of eligible voters turned out to vote in the five city mayors and city councils, and this is being seen as a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying jeou Party.
Through the development of revolutionary business relations einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, its policy has changed the relationship between the Chinese native country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only barely.
Despite his Kuomintang Party (KMT) of three makes the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater autonomy of Taiwan, nearly 50% of the votes, the KMT has received 45%.
In a presidential election this would have meant for Ma's problems.
Since his election two years ago, the share of the vote, his party has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time drew even a the DPP, coupled with the KMT in the city councils.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with from convenience / shift end mass parades and dancers broke only sparingly.
There were even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election in a speech in a KMT candidate
Schoß him as a man from the crowd face. Umstehender Lien has been injured and a spectator killed.
Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter kill Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate wanted.
Regardless of the attack has put Tsai of mine, and who, according to the leader of the DPP, the election undermined and the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationship has not been raised on the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not put their relations with the government in Beijing to the fore.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stoking the anti's Chinese feelings too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive.
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy.
The government in Beijing, will continue to pursue his strategy zurückzulocken Taiwan with economic incentives in the community.
China immediately sent a negotiators after Taipei to prepare for a summit about investment security and medical collaboration.
It also wants a political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would prefer to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it has been greatly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shin's bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the complete independence.
But under Tais gemässigter reign of a new generation of politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young.
Tsai was a presidential candidate, the DPP big approval, such as Su Tseng and chang under Chen.
Their party is doing everything, to show that they, too, is in a position to build close ties to Beijing.
Tsai is planning a Ideenschmiede as a point of contact between the DPP and China, this presupposes prejudice free discussions.
Tsai stated publicly that their party "a trustworthy alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
His cell from, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He urged the pragmatists Su even to forego the presidential candidacy.
Chen's without interference of the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own analysis.
MAS values are bad, in spite of rapid economic growth, and the KMT candidate wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
KMT, according to a spokesman, he will transform his cabinet and the local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports a rapprochement only restricted.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return."

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found after five hours, often heated public hearing the unanimous approval by the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project to promote both terrorism and traffic jams.
But, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new center of religion is in line with the local rules and will be an aesthetic catch.
"The project is supported by many good people - of Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"As Americans that makes me proud."
"It shows that there is justice."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They are just very loud."
"In this valley wonderful people live."
The sitting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the building of the centre lasted until almost midnight, and the voices on both sides, according to the Press Enterprise fairly evenly distributed.
The debate was held on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America more," a comment was.
"It is a different planet of the apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have led in other parts of the country, to protest, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.

Opponents the city council could still lodge an objection to the project.
Arsenic � resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere permit
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria that can live and others, of arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Even though scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on Earth, it is their view, a sign that a life is also without the vital elements saw as possible.
"This body has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and fellow author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six key elements have been viewed as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the researchers found, the bacterium in Californian mono Lake continues to grow even when it replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
'One wonders what else is still possible, "the fellow author of the report, said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for living außerirdischem, since scientists recognize life and its forms must, Anbar.
The study concerned with microbes that have been found on the planet.
Announcing a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery known, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could act außerirdischen life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements include biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'standard elements', which in our opinion that are absolutely vital, not necessarily clear Charles Cockell, a professor at the Research Institute Planetary and Space Sciences open university of Milton said," Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research teams.
"This work is a first, because it shows that one element in fundamental biochemical processes and structures to be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe Astrobiologischen Institute's Simon from NASA, which led the study chose the mono Lake because of the high level of arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they took that microbes, who are both suspended, may be an element that can be replaced by another.
"The toxicity of Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphate."
"That the organisms would find it hard to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsenic works unlike phosphorus. It enters our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," said Anbar.
Researchers from the bacterium GFAJ 1 increased arsenic concentration. It to contain itself and grew.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic occur based life form could happen, of course, either to earth or to another planet or moon, where arsenic more often.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that white phosphorous can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there was no functioning example.
Arsenic above came in the early Erdjahren more often, she says, so the science is on the assumption that early life forms have used it.
"This is reason to believe that life may have evolved, unlike in early Erdzeitalter," Forster, who was not a member in Wolfe's Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.
Rest of the exhibition found stolen dogs in Compton
The other two of four exhibition dogs that have been stolen in a Bellflower's Motel, were found, according to the Los Angeles County sheriff from Thursday.
The four exhibition and two dogs - two Akitas Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unidentified stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals in a Bellflower Motel 6 were staying at night, the authorities said.

Whitmore was no precise data on the site of the dogs to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is ongoing."
"We would like to say no more," Whitmore said.
"We are following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina and David Rickard Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
She took her two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district veterinary home in Downey in reception.
Representatives of the sheriff found the vans and the two dogs to different places in Compton.
Akitas, the Trace, a 3 years Rüde, and Didi, 10 months old Hündin - were unharmed, according to the authorities said.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek tried to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard in Redding were this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace the competition should attend live.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dog must participate in the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show in other competitions.
Southern California is a freeze on almost month-long tour of the couple of dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening checkten itself Peek and Rickard in a Motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their vans in front of her bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppies, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany Motelzimmer - with it.
The Dick fur Akitas Corgis remained voluntary and in vans because it was cold.
They open the windows gave a broad wedge, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6: 00 p.m. as stolen.

The lion brüllt back to judicial approval of MGM / restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty now MGM have finally received the green light for a new beginning.
A New / York bankruptcy judge on Thursday to prepare offiziel "'Gläuberplan are blessed, in order to clear the debts to the tune of $5 billion to pay off and the 86 years of entertainment companies the way for new films and TV shows.
In accordance with the evidence of Thursday the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, that is the start of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the slightly reduced studio as the main business leaders.
The staff numbers will be reduced by more than 400 to around 320.
For MGM Chapter 11 effectively only enters into force if JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to fund the new MGM's production.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which brings in even $75 million, the company is in charge of the financing should stand by the middle of December.
Restructuring the studios began in May 2009, with the mandate to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of companies that struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year to help resolve its financial problems.
In August, the chief executive Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who has been known by its activities in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Efforts of Moelis & Cooper, to resolve financial worries auszubezahlen MGMs and the more than 140 Gläuber of studios that lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company to buy.
But the auction drew few bidders and no one wanted to pay the requested by the creditors $2 billion.
In the spring of this year, it all started from scratch when the MGM's team began with the restructuring plan, which was signed after months of debate and infighting, at the end of October, at last, by the creditors.
If MGM in the next few weeks has survived bankruptcy officially, Moelis Cooper for their work and receive a bonus of several million dollars.
The proportion of Moelis & company, which has already received $1.2 million, amount to $9.5 million
Cooper, which, for the management of the company a month $375.000 paid, receive a "success bonus" of $4 million)
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. In this year the studios came only a film and produced an annual plan with seven or eight films, which will come from the beginning of 2012, in the cinema.
They also plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in Co production with Warner Bros.
The studio needed a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are supposed to be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded approximately 18% of MGM / loan, sought a merger of the studios with Lions gate entertainment, whose largest shareholder, he is.
But the recent negotiations between the two companies has led to any result.

And though fewer new toys seem with its own website, is the most prominent of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range.

Police operations in China will be smooth
As a training officer stepped in Tang Shenbin on an urban space, reviewed its jittery subordinates and issued with military authority voice and more muted orders.
He wanted to that its female members of the Chengguan - China's robust riche impress the urban planning, feared and despised for their random raids and their tendency to violence - the viewer.
"Just are!"
"Look ahead!"
"He shows them," it is to them, "as beautiful girls are so!"
Four girls, barely grow out the teenager's age, with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jackets and trousers were blind.
Four pairs of black pumps were in gerader series.

Several governments have already tried to revamp the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city all new applicants must have a university degree.

Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by Lower rigid: 2009 reports that 50 officials at skittered on a properly established Imbisswagen and give birth would gaze at the operators, until this einpackte after half an hour and left the room.
Xindu, an urban district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women increase urban police patrols. They were specific because of their appearance, selected its good character and their youth.
They are supposed to make the crude police a softer, femininen aspect.
Unfortunately, however, it would also be a Scarlett Johan Son little to improve the bad image that the Chinese command of this city.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police these officials should assert the city laws only through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officers in the province of Hubei beat a bystander to death, when he filmed them with his mobile phone, as it nullified a protest action against a dustbin.
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials have been stolen and published on the Internet, such as criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.

One facing violence strotzendes video games that can be downloaded from the Internet, in China, educated officials shows in an attack on street traders.
"Chengguan the government fear power" lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called a "truly thorough cleansing."
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate.
The Distrik sought in October via display eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News, the question of whether the women had intended to serve real tasks or only as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to make display women were looking at the age of 18 to 22 with a good figure and "harmonious face trains."
They should be large - on average 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials of the activity for women over 25 is physically too demanding.
"The most important is their image," a district official unbenannter stated in quasi ruling Rednet.com website.
"Whether the candidates will get the job depends first of their appearance, such as size, weight, face, etc."
Then temperament and "inner qualities come."
Chengguan put "women are like," he said and added, "but they also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city government of the southern, this description would not endorse
Admitted, though, that sizes in advertisements for both sex are not unusual in China.
The same is true for uniform face to face.
Whether it is the same thing as good design, is a controversial issue in China.
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply.
"We can here, unfortunately not blind or Buckligen use," Mr Zheng.
"Their image would not be a good thing."
Liu Yi, patroliert Baoguang Square at the close of one monastery, is 22, has a well geformten Apfelbäckchen and mouth.
Empfindetes not put them as sexist that so great value on their appearance.
"Find you, I see in these uniforms sexy?" She wonders with ironischem glance.
Their colleague with Grübchen who commented on 21 years of Xu Yang, said, "We have a duty to represent the image of the city."
Their claims, according to the brief cessation not regret it, because they would have been more ambitious career plans as dealers simply through the alleys to prosecute them on business to prevent.
Every morning the Streife deals with approximately 12 street traders try which, on foot or on bicycle to sell as many as possible and rolls Tofugerichte before they are further being hunted.
"Mr Wang, disappear you here please."
"We have already told you so often!" Declares Frl. Xu a trader who fled on foot and was his on a Fahrradkarre befestigten Nudelküche temporarily abandoned.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than demanding.
"It is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, in the leisure distribution system studied.
Everything "routine."
One reason is that the female servants must not the goods of the traders, as their male colleagues have.
They can criminals only threatening to notify it of her male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after the rumor told, Chengguan's officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and the Chenguan officials were injured in the night of the incident, 14 government vehicles were being undermined or set on fire.
Xindu remained insulated from such violent incidents so far.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square in which the female servants patroulierten this morning, about 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired in contravention of the rules on the sidewalk instead of a workshop.
The owners cried a hue and cry.
After 15 minütigem hesitation, the officials made with cruel point the way to their cars and continued with the motorcycle and his owners.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, remained, but he turned around his white names shield to remain anonymous.
As their colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supporting role.
But they have not been trained to present a clean image.
Verbally "sometimes we go."
"Sometimes but also physically," says Mr Li calmly.
"Most of the time to catch people with the dispute."
Prosecutor will Senator Ensign will not denounce
Prosecutors the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations levelled after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to make her husband, a lobbying against him, the lawyers of the senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision will put an end to the worst piece of junk against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and his career was a drubbing he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was about the judgment, after a year of investigation "delighted."
The ethics committee of the Senate, could still impose an Disziplarstrafe.
According to the Ensigns lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were halted, and that no further prosecutions in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise, in their view, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has flouted the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, which have been shown for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents helped to lucrative contracts, in order to buy his silence about an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as treasurer.
Ensign took contact with a few political friends to give Hampton work, according to the documents and interrogations, he took it for the next recruitment Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns election team, it was, he had a year no lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts this unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who had before the affair was chummy against the ban on the revolving door 'Lobbykratie.
In accordance with the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door 'statutes," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defense of clients, which are in the sights of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice it officially rejected, the reasons for the decision to give in the case of Ensign, Mr. Fire and other ethics lawyers, the Department seem very cautious in fuelled political prosecutions said after a multitude of failures, which have been followed with great interest by the media, including the decision of last year falling charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are apparently fearful detention," Melanie Sloan said that the chairman of the association, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is the fight against corruption in political and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign brought to court.
"Which essentially means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday, a public prosecutor, and another the next day, in which he was informed that the department will not levy charges against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the Senator, acted as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, in accordance with the law ."
Mr Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments which he had presented to the public prosecutors, more precisely.
"I am not satisfied, to go into the details of talks between the Ministry of Justice, and I am, just as much has to be said, we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to discontinue the investigation because of a separate action by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of breach Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons to the federal electoral law.
The Election Commission said that it had not been enough evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a major company in Nevada, which for a long time, supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists work.
An electronic mail of December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has moved as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton, where he told him that he anklopfe at the Ministry of Interior on a thing. "
Mr. Ensign was also agreed with Mr. Hampton and other customers for Nevada, and Allegiant Air, to lunch and asked the Transport Minister, to arrange a meeting in the name of the airline, after it had stopped Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
Than last year for the first time, information burst on this affair to the public, to apologize to Mr. Ensign in his electorate and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in the order of precedence of Republicans in fourth place.
After he was struck many months no more, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he would like to see a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign no longer the target of police inquiries, its press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper said the senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and his investigations once figures.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's appointment makes attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them away tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
They verschickten tact in the minutes on Twitter their reports about grey of testimonies.
At the end, so the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process, about rape and to beds gekettete children in a house which go up in flames.
On Thursday, will be closely followed the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end to find, if the verdict on the death sentence, that the jury has spoken, falls.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in court to explain the reasons for an appeal and will concern the courts for years.
One of the most provocative of the reasons is that it was due to the intense coverage of the process, even through extensive use of Twitter by average reporters, to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details so that the jury had been influenced in an improper manner by the public outrage.
This objection could induce Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules to be in the courtroom.
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that if the basins of the new technologies in the courtroom this influenced each individual's right to a fair trial, Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes said," main defenders.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected last week's requests, via referendum succinctly when he said that the new media "would be monitored carefully," and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
Court for decades a Proverbs have found that the reporting on notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of the process.
In its historic decision taken in 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States has overturned the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, osteopaths from Cleveland to have killed his wife, and said in its decision that it would have been because of the New Media "Karnevalsatmosphäre in a courtroom."
Some believes that the television series and the movie based "on the flight" to this crime.
Some lawyers say courts a Proverbs, which consider sentencing Mr. Hayes half a century later, might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication channels from the courtroom, who were at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard still inconceivable.
"There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in processes which will be followed by a broader public, to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who has studied the use of the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report is it arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte might be fascinated by the idea that restricting an immediate communications make the courtroom, it could be the process fair.
The Twitter case is just one of many that make the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss in years and thereby prolong a condemnation.
The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already guard, as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reaction of potential Juroren by showed them during the grey Jurorenauswahl cent scene photos.
Some Juroren said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke's Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they have been met with revulsion.
The defenders say, they would also make the constitutionality of the death penalty, called into question, and argue that the judge wrongly have exchanged a jury, who was a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as it had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury over the weekend.
The Juroren were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process may drag the greatest interest.
In a judgment ruling, which they submitted last month, have made it clear that the case of the intelligence in Connecticut had dominated and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate of the candidates have been discussed.
They argued that the new media have constantly fanning the flames of the emotions on the case.
"Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom wrote," the lawyers, "it has never before seen in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Its focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews some journalists said that the claim that this direct messages were a rabble-rousing but reports that are reimbursed more slowly, is a hostile view of technology, of the report on future processes verarme.
But some lawyers said Appelationsgerichte were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes need the Adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this assertion.
In its objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court, from 1966, in the conviction of Dr Sheppard was lifted due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Courtesy can combine what divides us?
After a campaign of epithets and negativity this week broke out little civility in Washington.
It is the sign of a genuine two parties cooperate or a moment of delusion before we revert quickly back to the struggle of the political parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues that we had to look at what has been called the "lame duck session," the session at the end of a period of government, no more decisions to be taken.
After everything we hear, was there to govern either a polite discussion between two sides or an account of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points.
The public meetings of the president's deficit commission was similarly civilized on Wednesday, in spite of the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that there is a strong interaction will create over a period of months, a mutual respect that the ideological gulf that separates the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that it is thus a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are in a test phase, in which the one demands of the other signs of cooperation and a willingness to compromise, while they do not even attempt to balance the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare.
So the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment were limited by the participants at a minimum requirements or allegations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as you could see a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, expected.
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or pension, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least the November election has, at least for a short time, Washington voted mild.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"After elections that is inevitable.
Elections give partisan passions, the die again.
And that is a good thing. "
In some issues, particularly on those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts to end at the end of the year, and no one in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some, or even all, either temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that, it believes, who favors tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse assistance is to be expected a compromise regarding the increased unemployment benefits.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House of the optimism has risen that we can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and ratify at the same time, the New START treaty.
But William Glaston the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions of the lame duck session "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if the new 112. Congress will convene in January.
Instead, he says, for a period of not more than once immensely is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that must be done, is done will turn, these short psychology in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, is the courtesy to real cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from now until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said.
The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters, who were instrumental to their education.
How concerned the Republican leaders also may be that they vie too high, they know that they need to try to reduce their commitment to the government and to set aside the health reform.
This party lines are already in the first reaction on the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce the government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so very pushed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes to get its plan for formal recommendation and they are fighting hard to get even in the vicinity of this figure.
The biggest resistance in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, little leeway or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes if challenging Republicans Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health care system, to be followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans wants still that the two parties are working together.
If confrontation in an impasse, as has happened in 1995, then both parties need to be careful with the public reaction.
Who will always doomed to lose, will have to change tack and seek a compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they appear to be a wider ideological gulf between Obama and the Republican Congress than at the time, between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the defenders of the two parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to see a much wider choice of 2012.
Seen as the courtesy, which will be taken this week display may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require both sides much more of an effort to find common ground on the issues that divide the two remain separate.
Durchgesickertes US document Moscow portrayed as a port of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of "kleptocracy," and it is a part of the bribes and the protection money they einsammelt, to the Kremlin, and the American Embassy in Russia reported in February, in a memo.
Blackmail both police and the state security service high protection money so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate transactions, but also by criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as "vertical line of power" - takes its share of the money, the relocating the ladder.
The memo, which was sent out under the name John Beyrle's ambassador to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited.
It was written, while still of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that has been cleared up in the meantime.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have rejected accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won a number of libel against such allegations.
In September, he said, a Russian television station, when he was asked after a documentary, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is a bad way that it is dirty."
Office An unbelievably large numbers of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, the surveys have shown.
But it is unusual that individuals are, as has been done in the report of the ambassador, and it is unheard of that happening with a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the criminality that has led some to describe it as a" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a Kleptokrat as a government," according to the memo.
"Criminal elements) enjoy 'kryshna" (a phrase from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means' umbrella 'or protection which extends over the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as by all of the Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world from Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Least the ordinären criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the bottom."
Inkompetentes "this is a system in which criminal groups to fill a gap in some areas, because the city is offering any assistance."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest firms, the police and the small businessmen arrested.
Means a source, so, "declared that Moscow's business owners (to understand that it is best to get protection by the MVD and FSB and not) by organised crime, not only because they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"Why the protection by criminal gangs is no longer so asked how sooner."
The memo noted that, while the collection of the funds is comprehensive to be the protection even very modest, no; even those who pay, are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay to find their business closed very quickly - on the basis of one or other of the pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about how to combat corruption, but at the same time, has said that he has made little progress.
The message the memo contains descriptions of men who go with with suitcases, which were presumably full of money, in the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of said By voting, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of that bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because there is a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, as he says that corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, estimates as By declaring that Russia's corruption is costing more than $300 billion per year.
The country ranks 154 a recent study on global perceptions of corruption through the nongovernmental organisation Transparence International (countries are of "the least corrupt," "most corrupt").
The disclosure of the memos, the American Embassy what happened after dusk Moscow time, will certainly claim cause displeasure within the Russian government, though, given that Luzhkov can be blamed for the errors of Moscow, it is in the Kremlin also be a possibility that they solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin said that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded cited furious at the revelation that American diplomats Medvedev him Batman and Robin.
"The truth is that it is a matter of our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and to so unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a poorly lit class room with dirty and abblätternden walls betonierten, the director of High School Anlong Veng reminiscent of the man who built it, to the future, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Ta Mok everyone here loves."
"He was a good leader, and he has taken care of its people," Kor Sreng Ma, 42 years has said.
Known for its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule as "the butchers', the commander, remains popular in this outlying former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north west of Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developing the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers are still living.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng will be challenged.
In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims of public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime.
In June the government circulated a textbooks that told, for the first time, children of former soldiers in the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And a Community tribunal in July, the UN and Cambodia's convicted for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as it condemned the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge grew veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts to bring about reconciliation and reintegration into society in Cambodia.
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Centre said of Cambodia, an independent organisation which the regime.
It was "for life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, revision or from hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 the Pol Pot's IED government overthrew, the remnants of the regime and its military have fled to the border after Cambodia, Thailand.
Here they widespread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary have led a guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng took.
But in the middle of the 1990s, as a result of the United Nations sponsored peace agreement in 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to cross on the government, which has led to the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and 1998, Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan.
Pol Pot died in 1998, of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who had not given ground, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain.
2006 he died in prison in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
As their patrons, they no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters who fled from grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many of the movement won in nostalgia.
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge won their local government posts, because they put down their arms, the ordinary soldiers poor, uneducated farmers were.
"These people have benefited very little by the capitulation," Sok Leang by the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, said throughout Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums keeps
"Enshrined in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew without any professional know."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle about anlang Veng before he was defeated in 1998 to lead a life than poor rice farmers.
'Life under the Khmer Rouge was a good thing, "he said.
"TA Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now, the life is difficult, because we need to look at ourselves."
The current, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal has caused concern here.
The beginning of next year, will seek the Court, Nuon Chea president Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The request of the court, it is that the old leaders, and those who are mostly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it has not said whether it will follow up on these four cases further action.
It has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has concentrated on In Chaem, 64 years, that was during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district Manteay Meanchey leader in the province.
2007 had they told Representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, they have led to the construction of a dam Trapeang Thma, a project in which thousands died from forced workers probably.
On a hot night outside of Anlong Veng In Chaem came back from work in the fields of their wooden house on a dirty street.
When the sun cast long shadows over the desiccated grass In Chaem refused to talk about their past with the Khmer Rouge.
The court should call them, would, they refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said.
"There would be no prosecutions more, would be this war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 of the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, while experts and historians to discuss this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and buried the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward, said Youk Chhang the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer's times means to bring together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to set the broken parts together, so that like everything to understand."
The centre has created the first of the government approved textbooks on the Khmer Rouge who 75seitige "history of Democratic Kampuchea."
The book it circulated in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which is less than four sides contains about the Khmer Rouge.
How often young people in Cambodia in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the links of the city, to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student in Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbooks helps the students to understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents have reacted skeptically, as he brought the book home, to read about it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are being sentenced by the courts."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbooks and the court gradually influence, "he said.
Still the Khmer Rouge has a powerful appeal.
High in the Dangrek mountains of Sträuchern überwucherter and with plastic waste verdreckter path to Rechteck of black soot leading to covered with a pair of rusty Blechdach.
Pol Pot's body had been burned after his death, in 1998, on a pile of tyres.
Sothea Nuom, 31 years a Handyverkäuferin at the roadside, said that they do not know much about the man who had been burned.
"But he has a very strong spirit, and many people here to pray for him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will take a more mature bush bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus is in agreement, not weapons grade uranium accumulate
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure worldwide nuclear material has announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that it will gain no longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, in an additional articles of the security summit.
The US government had been trying for years, know to convince Russia, no more highly enriched uranium and to collect last spring seemed to have achieved a hurdle.
But the US administration officials told the Washington Post that two secret agreements have been in the last two months, with Belarus to remove weapons grade uranium, 187 pounds from a Belarusian Research Institute.
It was the scene for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to a official staff, who will remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the subject, about £500.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" to be in April, which had excluded White Russia.
And it was apparently good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic at the next summit in 2012.
"I was really impressed by the fact that they want a seat in Nuklearen Security Summit () by 2012."
"Which shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership with Global Security, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, in the space of four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government six countries has helped to get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done, under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit of the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko has said that the nation will never give up their uranium.
"As enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is radically weapons capable, and less highly enriched uranium reserve," Lukashenka said at the time.
"This is our commodity... We will not make it a dirty bomb and we will sell it to anyone."
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus in approached yet a few months ago, the United States, as it signaled interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt, the uranium Belarus in October to remove, was particularly complicated, because the material easily verstrahlt was, say officials.
It was loaded into a Spezialzug, of the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out by air, according to the officials.
The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money goes to the Belorussian research with depleted uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely careful coordinated and voted to build confidence," to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working on the Global risk reduction said.
The James Martin Center for estimates Nichtweiterzugebende studies that Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve the joint agreements be camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because Lukashenko's contempt for human rights to be harsh.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"The progress of this global security issues welcome heißend, the United States of America and Russia knows that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential to the development of the country and its citizens," they said.
No objections from the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as stated in a telegram of the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.

The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government wanted to "give this matter no great attention, although the government had little influence, as they were in the hands of the judges."
Vicente González gave the prosecutor were in January 2007, in turn, to understand the message that he would not block the court initiative to apply for Deklassifizierung of documents, the Spanish intelligence central (CNI) and the defense minister about the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdensome or sensitive information," said the ambassador, after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States on the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish state prosecutor, and the German prosecutors' more concerned than were the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments," Aguirre complained.
During a lunch meeting in March 2007, on which of the ambassadors of the US, and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, annotated the latter that "although the Spanish judges were incredibly strong on their independence and it would do what they think is appropriate," he gave instructions to his staff, "to avoid inflated rhetorical comments to make the suspense abate."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
," despite their generally pro-American attitude our experience have taught us that the PP will have no doubt, is a reminder that the government might Zapatero's actions of the United States, which are interpreted as a possible human rights violations are tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital will, even if the revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he stresses.

Popular Party won four seats in the Congress and PSC 9 lost
With the results of 28 November, the PP could in cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a decisive role
After the significant voice and Members increase in the last regional elections the PP is already looking forward to the general election - or not, and their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that made this party in this election, which is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
As the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, but was the paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
Reached last Sunday the PPC 384.091 votes.
If these rising trend - outcome of the diversion of the voting shares of the PSC and the fixing of the electorate - and the PP should continue, the analysts predict the PP for the PPC from 8 in the parliamentary elections could rise to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (it has now would gain 10) and lose the PSC at least nine members (25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose an MP - at the moment, she has three - while ICV keep its Members or gain a could.
Should the election calendar, however, will continue to fall, the next date with the local elections in May 2011, and even then can the People's Party (PP) on the tongue, with the socialist hegemony to put an end, and in the four provincial capitals and Barcelona, with its majority in the city council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros in 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Gerona Lérida and, where the Socialists neither a majority still fall back on its traditional allies (ERC, ICV), to lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose their representation in the local council as emblematic in which they should reach 5% of the votes.
However, the PP recorded an increase in their share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are to be convinced to play the main role in Tarragonas turnaround, where it had ruled against the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as at Badalona, Reus Castelldefels or the People's Party, has been a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and is seeking the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried al Qaeda of thousands of passports
The seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the policemen of the secret service, the Barcelona police arrested were Pakistanis and the Nigerians of Thailand from managed jihadis tables cell different al Qaeda groups, including supplied the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and "e Tauba Laschkar Party" (Let) - the latter was a writer of the attacks in Mumbai which claimed 106 deaths in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister to these investigations of major importance, to the extent that he is assured, with "Operation Kampai 'was being weakened, Al Qaeda of counterfeiting apparatus in the world' and 'therefore their capacity to act."
Researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell in Catalonia was actively, thousands of passports has been sent to Thailand, where they have been sent fake and then on to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda is made up, so that their "fighters were" with impunity the borders of European and other Western countries.
The revealed cell is not the only one of the jihadi network, which was active in Europe, and that is why no have contributed the Thai investigation bodies other European police units to the investigation, and it is not inconceivable that it will be in the area of the EU in the coming days similar attacks such as the one that was carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, and Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerians Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) was carried out in Thailand, another in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar flounder and Zeeshan Ehsan flounder and the Thais Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led by Bangkok from the in Spain and other European countries based unit.
The Catalan network - part of it was made in the year 2009 - stole especially tourists cancel out passports, in accordance with the objectives of the "World Islamic Front."
This means that the documents had to be issued on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 years and be valid for several years; they were allowed to have no visa stamps.
In study circles is underlined that, until now, no link could be established between the Catalonia and the attack in Mumbai, although the author of the attack, "e Tauba Laschkar Party" was one of the recipients of stolen groups in Spain and then forged passports in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that it had been sent a few days before the attack in Catalonia from using a money transfer company several thousand dollars that have been invested in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, "later by the members of the" commandos "that caused the lives of 106 people to an end, have been used.
The police have seized a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement Mas
The chairperson of the PPC, seemed Sánchez and Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday, Artur Mas submit myself their conditions to support his first as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are no different from those already raised during the campaign and be with the primacy of economic recovery, and the adventures of regionalist independence as a financial compensation agreement, which will be proposing the regionalistische leader at the height of his mandate.
The head of the Catalan People's Party went through security at Artur Mas, who was awarded it the 18 MEPs, which they won last Sunday - a point which is more than enough, in order to feel indispensable. Because the candidate from Civic regionalist party CiU instructed to ensure that at least one of the opposition parties, abstained from voting when he took office.
Future alliances, who want to go to the turn in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress, depends on a possible entente with the PP; the talks leading Mas at the time with the other party leaders, however, are in Catalonia.
What the party chairman of the PPC, these demands that all discourse that the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia concern ," as well as an agreement on the financial balance between government and the autonomous region, as the Basque Country - and wants to subject the party leader of CiU even a referendum, to be given back to support the office."
Two political leaders want to have in common is that they exaggerated the make political apparatus of the regional management leaner and eliminate the inheritance and gift tax.
With the details of the negotiations, for the inauguration of Mas from the PPC Jordi Cornet and Montserrat Dolors deal.
MAS has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old nursing home confirmed that the deaths not on "lack of action" are due
The owner of the old home, in Olot does not preclude that killed their carers on 11 elderly
The leaders of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they saw the damage which the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the carers who had during his work killed at least eleven of old people, for which he was responsible, had - to the establishment.
The director of the elderly home, Joan Sala, was accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat would like to the people responsible (for the deaths) accuse ', but' the right and forcing our liability us accept the process and civil liability."
The establishment must accept not only a social prestige lost, because they had not discovered the criminal acts of Pflegers in time, but is now paying a high compensation sum, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009, and that he had since been murdered.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - Former patients of the old nursing home - because it suspected that no doctor had examined the mortal remains personally, but the formalities have been phased out because of their age and disease, by telephone.
The director of La Caritat verneinte flatly this point and said that could "lack of action any time have been the cause of the incident."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there was "no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused."
Already as "death angel" Getaufte 11 murders confessed to the other day and said that the first of the crimes perpetrated on 29 August 2009, and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime, where he was administered a mix of various sedatives.
The director of La Caritat said the access of the staff to the drug is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and tranquilizers cocktail 'of carers in six of nine crimes committed to rid the patient with the death of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory research will highlight, whether Vila is lying and his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he ausbrannte this from the inside, by them Bleichlauge insist, as he had done, according to the confession when three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat Pflegers listens to the testimony of no faith, not even as far as the number of murders gestandenen, which might well be more; that attitude it justified that Vila had made very different statements in court, and that it makes no sense, his approach after eight successful murder suddenly to change.
They say that they turned it for this reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of the judiciary.
Arms of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond."
The risk premia Peripheriländer the euro have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
But we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive themselves and the euro has appreciated almost in points, leads to worry.
The events of yesterday are typically recovered for an illiquid market, to the extent that it breaks down again, but as a result of the closure of a short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not lose his fear for a long time yet.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, that the ECB must tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably even a number of times in the future, a step backwards.
The Federal Bank, called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, since these were ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, and it should be only a einwöchiger permanent access maintained.
After the Ireland's crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures, extended 'at least until March "and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access at quarter end to provide liquidity at least until June, will be maintained.
We also expect that the programme will continue to purchase bonds and spend a stärkendes signal.
If the established expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets will set back again by yesterday and when will halstarrig insists that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As well as of the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reaffirmed to consider the purchase of government debt securities not considered and the markets collapsed and as a result, may be repeated this story tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persevere.
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday, they said, to have bought a lot, a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday the auction of a year of state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The state asset management from was only 500 million to 5,28%, compared to 750 million to 4,81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the resistance rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points in the entire curve and reflected a perception of changes in the markets after the words Trichet's.
Schuldenlochs in Ireland the figures published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The amount to approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly further 15,000 estimated. There are period until February to raise private capital or are these banks to be nationalised.
While Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had identified the problem with the stress tests, in July, the figures in the context of the recovery plan, are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the Government next Tuesday must receive parliamentary approval for his new budget, since it does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has built their discourse on the summit, the heads of state and government on 14 December moderate, where political unity is needed to show that we play together, the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries which Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish Government President presented yesterday, the action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as with financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures, measures that sound to the ears of investors as Vivaldis four seasons.
The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explained why the Spanish stock market has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Bank of Spain was quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result.
Today, there is a crucial auction of three years of government bonds, which benefit from Trichet will take effect, so we put on a strong demand, which will remove any doubt on our ability to refinance.
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self sacrifice.
We would get liquidity, which we do not need, and the Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in March, and the rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without any notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the existence, but also of the false."
Just courage that we create.
The CEO of fechtet Eulen at the request of his children the meeting of shareholders of Vega Sicilia in
The storm, in open conflict the Alvarez family, owners of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, flaut not.
David Alvarez, founder of Unternehmensgurppe, is the attempt by El Enebro meeting of shareholders, which will take place at the request of his five seven children on 16, will challenge, as he sees it as "absolutely void."

Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The car be improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull in 2004 moved into the world of Formula 1, its history is marked in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes.
Nobody initially gave the newcomer of attention and, despite their sharply rising will fare during the last seasons all on victory for the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso began the final spurt last November.
Without wishing to diminish the ability of the German pilots and champion Sebastian Vettel or the current strength of the engine by Renault, the "secret weapon," the laid the Multi Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus created a winning team, become a legend.
In reality, is a powerful software to simulation of processes, the 2007 German companies for purposes that have nothing to do with the auto racing, on the market.
This as PLM called computer programme was used for the development of the assembly chains in factories in the world, power stations and highly precise tools.
Is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process will, before this will actually be built to avoid such errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has the development of cameras by Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and of the most famous vehicles from Nissan easier.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that the use of this software in the Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements which can be found on the race, and on the testing, design and implement.
Russwurm from leads, in 1992, in the view that, on average, ten engineers worked, in a season which could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements.
In Red Bulls team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer equipment they conduct analyses and all kinds of changes to the cars.
The Siemens managers explained the PLM software is said to be able to analyse all parts of cars between Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of GM for, only Renault responsible.
The materials, fuel, Aerodynamik and safety elements to be changed.
The changes can be, thanks to advanced production facilities and high tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours, transfer from the virtual reality of Simulators into reality.
The only border, which is set this crazy technical perfect are the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 - team must spend his race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a 50 km away from London.
There are two buildings, where visits are limited - especially by journalists - strong.
What is happening there, is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bulls but real Formula 1 - hero is the latest doubt rid world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that makes the energy drink producers in the service of his attendance at the race tracks, further protagonists, whose help inestimably and whose fame is zero.
The Technologichef the station, Steve Nevey, stressed that it was five years ago, say that the progress made in the area of R & D for cars contributed with 50 per cent for victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by a computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."

Sabadell wants to steal his rivals in three years ago, a million customers'
The caretaker board member from Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than some other managers; he believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but first discounting a new liquidity crisis, predicted debt and the end of the war.
Nevertheless, he anticipates a drop in interest rate spreads, the banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and the price of loans.
Sabadell expected to recover in three years ago, a million private customers - one still existing specialist.
Sabadell has found a way to make the next three years, and so, in a very difficult economic environment to survive.
The bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011.
The goal is not just to survive, without the public support from the FROB, but also to increase the share of the market for a million private customers - 700 000, if you exclude the customers who will lose the bank - and this is the great challenge facing the bank is, because until now it has given to its business customers more attention than their private customers.
This year, it did get 250,000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Its market share in retail is 3.5%, while the business customers make up more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan in 2011 to 2013 is the increase in productivity, austerity, cost reduction, and the challenges which the Bank in order, will they, together with annual accounts report present.
Few banks dare define and publish targets in these difficult times, as all of the plans of the banks by the financial crisis in the world are in disarray.
Sabadell will complete this year, in its four years ago established master plan Optima. This was initially interpreted to three years, but because of the market situation, it has been extended by a year.
Customers, who will be leaving the savings banks, are the main target of the Bank.
In a dated APIE organized breakfast said Guardiola, 2011, would be a "difficult" year "with a great deal of scope."
The manager assumes, Spain, it would be only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to build in two or three years' work '- is essential for the survival of the bank.
Even if he assumes that war will abate about liabilities - punishing interest rate margins - that risk premia, the banks and building societies pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity need to be transferred as compensation for the dwindling profit margins already on the price of credit.
"The issues of liquidity and funding are a structural nature, and they will put pressure on the credit."
"We have not off the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto spent on Thursday already ordering their Filialnetz to restrict the procurement of long term loans and the increase (cf. Zinsdifferenziale Cinco Díaz of 22 and 27 November.
Managers acknowledged, too, the banks followed Stategie at the moment "to increase the fees," but "within a competitive framework."

Ceca includes a second merger wave of savings banks from
General Director of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, was yesterday rejected the possibility that it be a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
As the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began several insisted savings banks do not participate in the first stage, they retained the second round.
However, the General Director of the Spanish savings banks' association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not be assured.
"I believe that the greatest part of the merger is completed, and the inclusion of Banca Cívica Cajasol in the group cannot be viewed as the second round, it was more about adjustments."
"The biggest part is complete, it may be that we have to replace siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all key processes are already completed, and they were controlled by Banco de España, which has supported all transactions are strong."
In a by the association of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast from led Olavarrieta that the concentration process was "carried out as quickly as possible, and that we have to be satisfied with the timely process that was laid down in previous periods, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España," he said.
"The transition from 45 savings banks, on average, 28 000 million assets to 17 with the 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process, and the number of financial institutions, has been reduced by 62% and they are now very much bigger, so we met the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta declared that "there would be a number unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, and absurdity Unseriösität" revealed, because "Banco de España exhorted us to complete on time before the end of the year."
General Director of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, stated yesterday that Spain is one of the strictest financial systems of Europe and "perhaps" the whole world was and added that those who anzweifeltenn that would do this "without deeper knowledge."
The manager remarked that we are in the current economic recovery is "not worried" must make about the situation of the financial institutions, and the savings banks, which have been through a "very significant" concentration process, which would be "completed as quickly as possible."
He also pointed out that the Spanish banks had the stress tests, which the ECB conducted in July, were very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets triggered a dual response from the government.
Hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, regulating by temporary employment agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who receive no unemployment benefits, and the privatisation of 49% from AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government of President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel, as the person responsible, which was pounding out of the current crisis.
Are to understand how these events?
It is anticipated, that Merkel's position is no mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
While Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective about the shape of our future that is at odds with the preservation of the old traditions of a large section of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, beginning in Germany too spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries in the south, would have to leave the euro area.
The second point: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it now sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, around 50% of the population.
Third: A review of the euro under German proposals, which means that greater macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that the targets being broken; möglichereweise the default of a number of countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
Germany's position is clear and has been for some time, and that is why there are now no excuses.
First in 2009, when both of the IMF and the European Commission that created incentives for deficits and the German government drew up a constitutional reform from the sleeves to prevent it from 2016.
It was the first sign of this divergence between what Germany is considered necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practice of its European partners, including France.
The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel delayed the decision to bail out Greece's painful.
At the time, which has been severely criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally opposed to a bailout of Greece.
Merkel has, after all, in the days of last October again with a clear position, and it is calling for a reform of the agreement of the European Union to allow the bailout of a country and to commit at the same time, the private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti - European as they propelled the Irish crisis and everything as follows.
But its proposal, though sweetened somewhat, was adopted, and in the coming months, we will be able to participate in the reform of the European Union, which is to allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to go.
It says all that it is - even though now unpopular measures need to be taken - as of this date the old operation of the euro.
2013 the birth year of a new currency area will be the countries in which the offender to be severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must take a share of the costs.
Germany shows us that we take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improve the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade balances.
The other option, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as they led by Spain in boom times, is simply unacceptable.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly to understand it is not.
It is not just a question of the government deficit runterzufahren until 2013 to three percent.
The requirements are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm.
And that we take advantage of the opportunities afforded us, by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and its twin announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that the hypothesis has, despite the criticism of Merkel, to create order in its own house, paved their way.
But the Germany called red line is there, and it is not so, that this would change anything.
Among the in contemplating the possibility is that we would not have to leave with little serious countries fully gestopften euro area, exclude.
In this case Germany could still tell us that there have warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The supposedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in stake of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a great deal of ink has been spilled about whether there a unsportliche was whether or not to act and should be punished, possibly both players by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a couple of minutes before the end of the game (your team had won already clearly) time and played several fouls, now so the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and, as the Real Madrid would make his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction the next league match against Auxerre and enter without tickets in the next phase of the game.
Finally Disziplinarkommitee the UEFA punished the coach of the club, Jose Mourinho, with two of the games and the players involved with various sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under these or similar circumstances, is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - following rules.
Part of the debate, described that have arisen in the case is the fact that a team of football clubs Real Madrid (of his anthem themselves and credit claims and on other occasions, his players are punished for similar incidents had) the key role played, and the drama by Mourinho, of an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians added.
In any event, the debate is about whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes behaviour contradicts the principles of sport, that means whether these acts are a rule circumvention. Indeed, this approach has to deal with the regulations of the sport, but it seems to make sense.
On this issue of the sporting spirit caused damage should be investigated.
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these acts, because it has not been an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is drawn to avoid a situation in which the offender to be unjustified benefit players from the opposing team, which did not happen.
The paradox of the action of players of the Real Madrid is that it does not reflect what we normally regard as wrong or circumventing the rule of the game, because the circumvention of the rule has not been taken secretly to avoid a sanction, but they should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage went from the offender to the deliberate Fouls.
Here that the rival was neither in a disadvantageous position still benefits to have feigned erheischt this game, it should be pointed out, because the obvious result of this action was that their own team had to continue to play with fewer players.
There is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club has not then on these players.
The benefit is evident in the fact that the players could start the next phase of the Champions League game without cards, which threaten their participation in any future game.
But it is a long term, up to a certain degree, uncertain advantage, because the team could leave too, at some point, the players received a sanction with this approach, and in the second round of World Cup tickets on that they because card accumulation with a card less than in the first round.
So that it is not clear whether there really is an advantage.
Ultimately directed not against such practices the sporting spirit to the strategic decisions, in order to learn from the rules a maximum benefit.
In this case, none of the players wanted to circumvent sanctions (which) would, in fact, a clear case of a rule around, they wanted more to choose, when they are subjected to this.
They made a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her.
Though the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that it is a matter for a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because it was about two self exclusions and because of the type of provoking Regelübertragung.
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport by these acts are less ethical as aesthetic nature.
Supply offensive on the customer groups fishing for Christmas dinner in Barcelona.
The dictatorship of the calendar will fall this year, a flood of reservations on days 16 and 17 December.

The fun at the celebration had not fallen, though, regardless of who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is a source of great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad is nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Disclosures by WikiLeaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The Internet portal content Wikileaks revealed the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan, and the US State Department confirmed the huge concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington worries.
On the edge of the speed and hefty the details, which will provide the documents on the content of the talks, and the mindset of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that the cooperation between the two countries, not stepped up in the area of nuclear security, but on the contrary, is declining, and the fragile Asian country more nuclear weapons that "a speedier Rhytmus than any other country."
Stored in particular the nature of Pakistan's nuclear programme - and that the weapons are not composed, but its individual parts, making it more difficult for a possible attack on its destruction - Washington cause sleepless nights.
The following risks on counts the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit by the former head of the National Security Office, James Jones, that the proximity of some nuclear facilities on the beleaguered territory by the Taliban, which were scattered suspected of nuclear material and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear material. "

On the hunting after WikiLeaks head
Obama appoints a heavy responsibility for the fight against terrorism, to prevent new revelations.
Interpol from is a red alert to the persecution and discover by Assange has.
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange has to do, is a complicated maze, in which the facts to enlighten only difficult.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red alert" to "discover and persecution" by Assange has.
However, it is not a traditional order the arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes on 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must meet in Sweden.
Also the lawyer assured the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could make contact with Mr Assange has."
On 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden issued the warrant, but it has been given until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities do not know.
As things stand. The 188 Interpol countries depend to identify and track down Assange has "provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot impose the arrest of an individual involved a red warning, many member countries consider according to the organisation the red warning as a licence for an Arrestierung - the needs of the national police will be carried out, particularly if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as it is in the case of Sweden and the United Kingdom, when Assange has is probably.
Action causing Assanges lawyers gesten published a letter in which they informed about the 39 years of the founders of Wikileaks is prepared to answer the questions by video conference, the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange has applied for exit from Sweden, and from the state lawyer, which is being compared with the Pavlovich sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Beria, security chief of Stalin, who received such approval.
"This is like a hunt, not as a legal persecution," is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him and his mother - claimed by Australia from the innocence of her son - thinks Assange has not at an unknown location on, but in silence.
Monday he was the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified location in an interview; the conversation, he asked for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats, the United Nations, in order to spy on and has violated international agreement signed by the US, they would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, that the request to resign as a "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we should care about the opinion of a type with a Web site," he told CNN.
Obama himself has asked a heavy responsibility for the fight against terrorism - Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents of revelations.
The attempt by the spokesperson of Präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange has to pay less attention, is contrary to the opinions, proclaiming the conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, will lead from January chaired the National Security COM Mitee of the House of Representatives, has asked the state department to investigate the possibility of WikiLeaks to the list of terrorist organisations to send to "seize their money and everyone who supported you or contributing to pursue."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange has had to "revoke be murdered."
"Obama should transform it into a target and use a plane not bemanntes or so what."
Who have not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and of possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone who was there, the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything is not an execution is eiine too lenient sentence," he told the station, Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret vote on its survival in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly of principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to make the umpteenth time of internal turmoil in the ranks of the the loss of 11 members and half of the voters in the direction of unemployment ERC from the path.
The party chairman is well aware that his threat of resignation is not enough to close the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod the Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor, and he will not deliver the same headaches, as other former tendencies.
So the leader of, Esquerra tried to win with a nod to the new critics, which secure its position until the next local elections.
For the outset yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional Council members from ERC could stay in office beyond its secret.
With ballot papers, not with a superior hand.
If Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a fine, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader would like to avoid the impression of divisions, as well as the subjugation of his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would not feel, with half of the votes plus one confirmed, and he added, without indication of percentage levels, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be a good thing.
The Carod close to demand by the president more than just the party to step down, an insufficient gesture, since the supreme body Puigcercós controlled congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to push for resignations, it will be reconciled with the Board an action plan from now until May.
They expect, in the drawing up of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will be presenting at the 18th to the vote in the Council to be able to participate.
Its intention is, for guaranteeing Puigcercós. In return to this promise to Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party is already a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that 'Polyphonie "pity of stability and he seeks to once and for all, to bring the organisation to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this sense the article, which the acting Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Given the Puigcercós an ideologue of holders Innovació thought of it for a fact that the party leaders will be "backed in exchange for a variety of objectives."
He was five, two of which are in the forefront.
First, the "restructuring" of the board of directors, so that at least 90% of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes, ERC should abandon the principle of full assembly than functioning at last.
He verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which will make it possible to hold the meetings with elected delegates.
By the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - the team that fought back to the latter two conferences is Puigcercós' obsessively.
In fact, the party leadership was in the Assembly by 2008 bebenden entrusted with the review of the General Assembly on one principle, Congress that should be dealing with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still out, because the internal infogle aufruhe of recent years has not been able to tackle this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors are on the lookout, the time may have come back to address this matter and for ever.

"With your voice that we are waiting for the time to come to listen to you," he said.
The message has been spread, after the 42 Republican Senators androhten, extended to block all voice for each law, except extending the tax reductions would from the time of Bush and the funding of the government.
Such a blockade, which has been announced, in one of the 42 Republican Senators signed letter, could have an impact on the vote of the Dream Act - Law and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade to the Republicans of the law questioned Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that he could trust that, once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We are all agreed that the tax issue must be completed before the end of the year..."

However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said that he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar has floated from Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
So the defenders of the Dream Acts must have several Republicans on their side if other democrats should choose to turn their backs on the initiative.
To the most umworbenen Republicans from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux in Florida, part of the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez took over.
Other Republicans, who in the past, supported the Dream Act, Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson in Texas, but they explained, to assist it on another occasion.
Another Republican, who had spoken out in favour of the bill, John McCain, has not yet set out his position.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, which analysts agree that the Dream Act is in the Senate, before the biggest obstacles.
With literature the nettle lay
The second round of 'The taste in the language' was a walk, in which the participants sought to narrative much
"That the sex in the language I do understand, but ... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" Asked the writer, Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua' open should, a cycle, which celebrated spanischsprachige literature and, on this occasion, the subtitle their question used (at another event was the round table devoted to the sex in the language, she said).
The finger on the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine spuckte Schriftstellein sweet the audience, which is mainly from young people did, at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) met, at this of Marisol Shultz moderierten round table remain where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero attended.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text before they Gonzalo Celorio devoted, and Shultz afterwards as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in the first person, and the originator is that looking is to know what a "wound" and from doctor to doctor, of which it is not the answer, but references to the guidance of its narrative.
The Infektologen they leave convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
At the end, after a frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, raubte her in the middle of the track, and is her stated but that wound was not a scientific term Psychoanalytiker enthült the secret: "The wound that really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character narrative sighs of relief and concludes that they "of the wound received only that this was really open, and does not exist '. But she is confident that the mood in the language and its pitfalls mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguans of Sergio Ramírez presented a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise of invention', and the finger being mentioned in the wound but discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism he tells of a famous who brought back the clouds touched far gereiste men or by a girl lost virtue restored; the narrative made a turnaround and reported by America, the great novel, it was not from the beginning of his own doctors and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the Eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, which all of us (the writer) inviting, the sham spottete witnesses who described in the true stories appeared, but in a different way, the history of America would have never been told, with imagination, could manage the even the feeling of shame has disappeared."
However, he stresses, "there are the madmen and liar, who imagine the best things," and that is where reality and lie close to each other, in which we know no longer belongs to which side the narrative where the fictitious literature reached the summit.
Actually he calls the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"From him will have to be told what we inherited it."
As Mayra Montero was commented on in the series, and even praised the writer the diversity of interpretations to which the invitation of Fil had contributed to the round table "The finger in the wound."
The Kubanerin Puertorikanerin devoted and their contribution to the large wound of social violence affects their country - such as the whole of Latin America - as a result of the fighting the drugs trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberate dedication," she said after she had emphasised that literature is communication and engagement that build up between the author and the readers, like in a "chemical reaction."
The evening chose the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also hevorhob "the finger of dedicated writer in the wound of the writer."
He said that, in a rapidly changing world, the intellectual habits and controlling consciousness will turn into dogmatism, and forget that "a small no behind every confirmation and behind every denial, a small favour."
"In order to be in possession of the idea and the reality of the situation, we must qualify: Like often meant to put the finger on the wound and harass those who feel a lot happier if they think in terms of caricatures, in black and white, prefabricated ideas without nuance, and harass the powerful who prefer, a division of the world in black and white and said he invited to rediscover the spirit of the letter.
Mr Romano is fighting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endspielen back Aufs and (he has experienced in his career, but three times he played key games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey ejected from two different, their respective coaches set styles are also, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endspielen back Aufs and (he has experienced in his career, but he has had three key games, and so far he has been a good thing, and this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
Argentina has played up with the medal for second champion, he has fallen a step behind the victors and amazingly, he has fought with the same team consecutive Endspiele.
The santistische strategist reached the first end game as coach in 'Torneo Apertura 2002' than del Morelia had the reins in the hands, with whom he learned against Toluca with 4 / 2 a great defeat; later, in 'Clausura 2003 he achieved the crucial duel, which he lost with 3 / 1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ', pocket in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén again had a setback, because the game came with 2 / 2 against Los Choriceros after 210 game minutes undecided, but at the time he came forward with 3 to 1 and two ways of plugging its title, but ultimately misguided three got his players the 11 steps and the game went to a 4 3.
Rubén had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey lost his major rivals, which is why he would not be prosecuted even by accident and rid themselves of the bad magic, in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he has confirmed that it is the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I would like to break no statistics, that is, for a club, my affection, I hingebe me, and that is why the title will come to me, but what is happening before, is the most important thing," annotated the tax man, when we asked him about the lost Endspiele.
The last final, he is still very much in mind, he assured, too, have learned: "The only lesson we draw is that, until the referee not flouts the end, we cannot celebrate, we have prepared at the line, to the players, since the last time we were prepared with two already Elfmetern getting out, and I believe that this is a lesson before the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series could be decided by a penalty shootout, not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We will never get to the penalty shootout, we would like to conclude the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, in previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately this fate gave us a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the intense desire to keep the title in the hands, which left us something for the final, and we hope that it will not be this time."
Romanso it is to be in power, not only second champion and, for the first time, to take the glory in the title.

He said that they should demonstrate its commitment to building the necessary bridge, to support the present government.
"We ensure that they implement a reliable work and, above all, for the society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who voted in the last elections to them their confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, head of the hotel association Islas Tres, says that one of the great challenges which the 40 representatives of the people are facing, the impetus and the common work is for the economic growth of the state, because these days, the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they will drive economic growth, creating investment incentives and infrastructure, which will help in any way, the creation of jobs."
In terms of the tourism industry, he called for the new members they should allocate to promote the tourism ministry the necessary value in the state budget.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second little TENs funds, which is incompatible with a major economic activity which brings foreign exchange and investment, and in direct competition to the agricultural industry."
Given the tourist projects must be money, the state security unterstütz and must be brought the alcohol law, which has not been taken in previous legislatures, has to date.

"I am strongly against this charter."
"I think with a party which has shown you shackles at the feet," Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberal Democrats has said, after the weekly Caucus meeting before the assembled delegates.
Liberals argued that the bill that allowed to keep any of one when it comes to transporting illegal immigrants identified controls next person up to a year, as proposed would violate the Canadian rights and freedom.

The new unit is not unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new unit at the fight against corruption and collusion from Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public inquiry into this issue.
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, said that this idea will not come from yesterday: Quebec had already, last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue.
The metropolis has since 1870 on a standing force against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement by Wednesday has more than just a surprise.

"We are aware of this problem."
Under Réjean 'parent, the President of CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public opinion poll.
"Ever more M. Charest insists that we want to prevent the formation of the Committee of Inquiry, the more people will like you and I believe that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to be able to set up a committee of inquiry, is the resignation of Jean Charest,"), for its part, declared Yves Boisvert, lecturer for ethics and policy systems to the ENA (staatl. High school to train senior administration officials.
Overcome this impasse, he proposes to grant the Quebec, the financial review control a special mandate, so that it can of corruption and collusion make appropriate research.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the review of control," he ruled.
He represents would just as the opinion that Quebec could give control the scrutiny the same power as commissioners, which allow her to commit the people to the statement.
The formation of the unity is not the only project in the drawers of the Intergovernmental Charest.
The Quebec will require from Ottawa, to amend the penal code, so, in order to be better adjusted to this type of crime.

The final supervisory boards had concluded that a discussion about suicide, which is the spread of the names of two people who have committed suicide, was in breach of the code of Rundfunkübertragung.

The majority of the board members had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed was that suicide, should not be seen as a solution to the food crisis.
"The majority of the supervisory board to account for the fact that the impact of the programme" le had a Dupont midi "a delicate issue raised in families fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he has been subject to any censure against his person.
The last point of contention concerned the statements that were related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane a Dupont and Jean's René Dufort had supplied on a media effective argument, that have caused a great deal of reaction.
Choi and the moderator had not declared, would to have donated for the benefit of Haiti aid, because we do not know with certainty, whether the people who need it receive the money actually donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive nature that their cumulative effect of them, however, represent an unwarranted negative portrayal of the Haitians.
"I have served my three day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My acts jungfräulich for one and a half years ago," the presenter said.
In all of the decisions of the Supervisory Council deplores the spread a ungehobelten expressions.
In all cases, of Choi / FM Rundfunkansager have "acted beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the radio station, which are supposed to inform his decisions among other unique during the prime time had within a period of three days, are minuscule.

450 million in contracts without tendering
Quebec has appropriated and hydro in a consensual way project planning firms 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydroelectric project East Main Sarcelle 1-a Party's Rupert.
In the middle this avalanche of contracts to more than 100 as a consortium, consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe is SM and the Axor, which has the biggest share, the project led to a total of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, named 'Énergie gérance', was in 2004, as a corollary of the decision by hydro and Quebec, the private sector, their responsibility to pass this important, hydroelectric project to the tune of a figure of $5 billion.
Early 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" of the lucrative contract without a public tender.
On the Parti Québécois is resorting to business consortia a serious ethical problem that evokes Wettbewerbsverdrändung and the risk of a price increase.
'This is a new way to a conspiracy and discredited the competition. "
"That means carrying out instead of conventional games rather than secret way now in an open format," Sylvain Simard yesterday, a Member of the PQ said at the press conference.
Simard early in the morning, raised the issue in front of the National Assembly, because it seems to be difficult for him to understand, as the interests of the public in this way it can be used.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon, when it was strongly deny that it had acted in this treaty at under one hat.
"I remain faithful to my line 'wetterte, they nourished by the PQ was" dishonest science "and" lack of rigour ."
She has said that it is "the least" that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is standard practice in the world.
It is usually in order to pool a time such temporary alliance that it will allow two or more companies, their expertise on a requirement in a tendering a complex project.
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity in terms of his work from level.
The construction techniques is under way and is expected to be drawn up until 2012.
However, the treaty has been awarded without competition was held that one; it had already been in negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec with relatively simple projects is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir "last week, noted that in the area of climate Bauingenieur- and advisory system applied model of the consortium is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflying the Quebecer companies register allowed to appoint more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of a more consistent life.
In this way the firm in Dessau in partnership with the majority of their key rivals, Cima +, Génivar, SNC Lavalin Party or Roche and Tecsult count works, for example.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, at one and the same legal entity lead back, namely at Dessau.
With the consortium "Énergie gérance," Minister Normandeau has stressed that the territory of the Baie James' is subject to a specific labour dynamics and that hydro's Quebec pays this fact since the 1970s, in a special way '.
Laporte Réal, the major employers' énergie d of Société de la) Baie James (SEBJ that the Treaty was approved following agreement on the project management has issued a statement that leave the nose on this fact has fill.
"If you make a tender and there are few candidates to your prices soar."
"You have two options: Either you do the people who are on this Mart and say to you: We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte.
This the consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of agreements on more than 50,000 by the Parti Québécois dollar received.
The contracts have been approved by either the US or the Québec hydro SEBJ for the project to East Main Sarcelle 1-a Party's Rupert.
After reviewing the newspaper Le Devoir was "more than 100 Ingenieurs- and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, including especially resources laboratory allowed between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC Lavalin gerafft Party had 22 treaties, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in this' Énergie gérance "mitzurechnen.
All these agreements have been negotiated.
They amount in total of 449 783 344 $, including the treaty with "Énergie gérance" at 295 131 564 $.
Simard Sylvain indicated that the four firms that constitute the consortium are known (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and the Axor) 'the Parti libéral du Quebec well ."
Minister Normandeau had let slip the PQ was also linked with the firms that financed them '"before she clarified that this is about their leaders.
Eurobarometer verantworungsbewußten consumption - The "green" label is not confidence inspiring
Green, but openly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence, one of the main actors of sustainable growth, but just a bit to the brand or the organic labels designed to steer his election.
It is a pity there are swimming, even though in a media universe, which is full of information for a responsible consumption just so: The barometer responsible consumption has to complain of a lack of credible information, a deficiency that makes itself as brake his commitment clear how the first reading was held yesterday.
Although they have promoted the use of what is called socially responsible products in 2010, nonetheless Quebecer seem to those who are trying to sell them to pay a little credit.
Quebecer to two thirds of the population are, in fact, paying the environmental commitment of the firms nor faith as green companies advertising, so that tells consumers by the responsible center of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated instrument.
Other findings: Half of consumers is casting doubt on the credibility of the official to the supposedly fair products annexed certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, who declare themselves as severe as the barometer.
Following the same pattern of the rhetoric of politicians to be taken on this matter of only 14.6% of population Quebecer seriously.
Information about responsible consumption seems important, however, to the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently revitalizing of approximately Quebecer only a third of the consumer.
In fact, empty and dubious character of information, often viewed as dampening the enthusiasm of 46% of users.
This is after the higher price of the products, the second, from the barometer Identified brakes.
In addition, a third of the projected performance Quebecer of green products and services, which it is trying to put them by the hand is facing, mistrustful.
According to another statement of consumers had already been amended over half in 2010, mainly changing their habits and the brand one or more products to give to their conviction.
According to Eurobarometer they had preferred to 61% purchases with dealers of their urban community, and encourages buying foods cultivated in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmental friendly consumption had reached this year, a 64 to the maximum value of 100 - Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as King of the recycling, which is trying to reduce its environmental left traces by he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness seems nevertheless to make before his car, as the scoreboard: Just 28% of Quebecer have indicated, used in 2010 public transport or to have preferred the Mitfahrzentrale to demonstrate their ecological concern.
Walking and cycling were also advocated by 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey the dining the stereotypes.
Government bond for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, which has been asked by the Société Angus and the undertakings parallèle to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, declared itself with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
Developers company Angus parallèle, as well as the company, which had hoped a donation of seven million dollars by the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of which Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to bring them back to its real cineastischen function apparently not receiving what they have demanded.
The government has accepted, to involve itself in this matter, however, on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers a bond in lower than initially expected, which could be a viable solution to create favourable conditions in life, at least in the opinion of the state from the rumours entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, which was rectified Bittgesuch since the sum again moderately down.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the president "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister St / Pierre, who is in charge of the Act eXcentris.
Several days ago, he had sent her a last technical report.
Against the proposal from the cabinet was the SODEC sent, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have to answer until 31 December time on this.
At least the assumption of government donation really seems to have been pushed to the side.
We remember that the Quebecer owner community of cinema and cinema complex had revolted against a direct state investment to support the takeover of eXcentris by made the argument that the Culture Ministers have no financial assistance to pay for housing projects there, he did not also allow other cinema.
Several other participants in the market segment of a charged, however, in contrast, substantial economic aid.
Cinema leader Daniel Langlois was funded after the ownership structure of the cinema over ten years presented with great difficulty that authors cinema in the premises of its cinema complex, which could justify the exceptional treatment by the Treasury.
The shortage of cinema, which shows independent films, it is more than obvious in Montreal, and his clientele eXcentris knew to keep on board.
Société Angus, as well as the companies with Christian Yaccarini parallèle at the top, in turn steer a privately financed Campagne, from which they expect a total of $700, 000 to boost the purchase.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle.
Goal of future purchasers is there that the three cinemas on 27 February of next year, with the exhibition to open up the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux '.
Christian Yaccarini but did not recall the newspaper Le Devoir "and ignoring what he and his group of the downward revaluation of proposals, which it has made them.
Secret of Canada lifted komplexgeschüttelten
The new, American diplomatic cables that were disseminated by WikiLeaks to reveal the secret about what the United Nations consider under the inferiority complex of the Canadians with the Americans; they openly show but with the same blow the superiority the latter towards Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters on the ballot has not the Canadian / American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to impose its budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were prevalent yesterday publicly pikante provide more details as the very substantial content, in which it has knabbern too.
A carved on 22 September 2008, that is, the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, as reported, the point at which the United Nations no longer participate in the operations of its political leaders are discussing.
To the great surprise from David Wilkins, in Ottawa used, American ambassador.
Mr Wilkins statement offers different ways in this situation.
"The Canadians led a near economic inferiority complex, possibly Canadian, political leaders are much more likely to talk about the internal disputes of everyday life to blame than the United States in this election the buck) (such as 1988 during the campaign about the free trade," he says.
Concludes the United Nations, he is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: Omnipresent, but potentially to menacing to talk about him."
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" the less, because the two countries have a strong political and economic relations.
"Logically," he judged that "should be the ability of a candidate, a party and a lot more of a Party chiefs to drive such a crucial relationship, which has of voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the end."
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, communication, to prepare President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa correspondence.
"Their journey will help to ensure the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada its first deficit after more than a decade will be known, this has come about because of a recovery program of $30 to $40 billion," Breese describes.
Anywhere would have to be postponed, he had said that the government had the parliamentary meeting before Christmas to prevent Parliament plunged by the coalition and would this conditional continuation of the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another, in January 2008, and carved by the ambassador Wilkins wrote communication released Washington came from the increasingly negative image that broadcast on CBC, dramatic serial spread from the United States.
The Ambassador is worried about mailings as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can see little more subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no fly list" or contributions for the purpose of interrogation Muskelprotze administered by the CIA.
Yet another announcement reported extensively, as Hillary Clinton remarked in its French counterpart Bernard Kouchner have asked for her first bilateral meeting on whether Europe should be willing to accept some of the prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.
Mr Kouchner will have answered the question, yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case to case, "decision.
Àm end of the meeting, described as "of the Secretary of State, he has issued a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15 year olds Muslims Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised, by the acts again."
We note, finally, that people are getting on the Web site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper set very close advisers, declared on CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed."
He had talked on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for renewal of the lighting
The UN has proposed a plan yesterday in Cancun, on the renewal of the lighting from households, commerce and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs), which is almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be done to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is its position in the concrete steps, large projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from industrialised countries.
After yesterday's plan the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) of the earth because of lighting on CFCs cast would be avoided if the White ardent pears, which are as yet a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, through fluoreszierende or better still), by emitting diodes etc (LED would be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year undertook major Abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada was to voluntary reduction plans, the global CFCs should emissions by 53 GT downsized to 49 GT.
Of this balance, however, we should withdraw 5 GT to stabilize from now until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to avoid that this out of control.
In the White ardent pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat escape, and the remaining 5% of produce the light.
With Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs we reduced these energy needs, again twice that.
Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen believe that, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that brought this week the producer Philips to the market - that society has, in fact, part of the UN study - a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a White ardent pear, which is to give an indication of the potential savings Auswechselungsplanes, which can be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that issue iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they will also be able to work with a regulatory resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists showed that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen have reserves, because they contain mercury, and that is why as they dispose of hazardous waste has to, which is not in the developing countries always possible, but the producers are an adoption centre available.
The major source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but the coal power stations that emit far more mercury to produce the electricity wasted White ardent pears.
In the United States alone this coal power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report gives a detailed account of the gains, which would each country, thanks to the international programme.
Indonesia would, for example, a $1 billion per year in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 saved, this means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expected excited about the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki moon and has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast, directly after the deadline.
"The Secretary General, underlines the necessity of the Independent Electoral Commission to receive their work, and to announce the preliminary results, without further delay," a press spokesman for the UN chief stressed.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast, to take their responsibility and to contain any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results."

On Wednesday many appeals from around the world, to proclaim cei finally the name of victory in the second round of elections under the of the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and whose opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp expects but with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which has been made by the former rebel camps of Forces (FN nouvelles) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign, of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the FN practised manoeuvres of voter intimidation had discouraged in the north of the country, the President's supporters to go to the polls.
The whole election could be declared invalid if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo will be considered by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo's opponents, however, are now more of the view that the highest court in the country would not be neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N 'Dré, a politically connected closely with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north, who denies any connection to the former rebels, has judged the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and Gbagbo asked to respect them, even if he did not go so far as to call for the victory.
His Bündnisparter reaffirm, Gbagbo blocking publication of the results, because he knew that he had lost; and submit a complaint before the constitutional court after it have prevented the election commission to publish the results, seie illegally.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday, has been considered the crowning glory of the association and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided into two parts over the years.

Clotilde Reiss affair: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria
Internally more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010 was the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spying," the French public in breath, terrified the diplomacy in alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the close scrutiny of the diplomats of the United States.
By WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde through American documents - some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had told the Americans of his strategy that went as far as to give this advice to deal with its own crisis of "hostage" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern).
It to show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of a young French woman have not the release of Majid Kakavand, a France and held prisoner by the American justice because of trade with material in favor of the Iranian nuclear programme Iranian Gegeleistung wanted to.
They are, after all, is the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to make this credible idea, the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.

This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in a predicament that respects very sensitive to its image.
"Is all the more to do as you ask Iranians, that does not."
Because 'silence solves nothing ," the debate over experiments on at unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are" master in Ausweichmanövern. "
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreign nationals is a "normal, Iranian tactics": "Of hostages for political blackmail."
He announces,) the release of Clotilde Reiss from jail (which should come on 16 August, on the day when they) takes refuge in the French Embassy, the payment of a large amount of money to demand that the Iranians' " (230,000 euros bail.
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage taking, a phenomenon that will "tighten up."
Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizen arrested who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss 12 days has been released from prison, however, is still being held in Iran.
An information was circulated: The Iranians, Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request, the United States, due to illegal trade with empfindlichem electronics materials to Iran, has been released after a ruling by a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
In Washington, which followed the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear programme represents the release of Majid Khakavand a bad news.
France has taken a horse trading in buying?
The release of the Iranian opposition to those of the French?
At a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "quite surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried to revolt against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French minister of justice" (currently, Michèle Alliot / Marie), but 'the French government is unable to change the judicial decision, "he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "stringent" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée advisers, a telephone number, to places, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians were "currently in the chair of the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris."
Respects during the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée his efforts not to think of the media, through statements and organised "flight tests," the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad is playing an "important" and "influential intermediary role."
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and conclude that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as a number of press articles reflect the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram rebellion evokes "the media bolt the French authorities."
As much "you can towards is based as" Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
Despite their declarations Lobpreis "with the French authorities to give in secret that they have only a vague idea about what the Syrians did indeed."
The document deals then to indulge themselves with the reasons that have brought the Elysée to these fiction.
The intense communication efforts "aims, Sarkozy's policy to confirm the opening to Syria," he examined.
2008, launched a policy which was then perceived 'by numerous critics vote in France and abroad than premature and unverdient. "
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria in mind is trying to lead what laud you can reach by playing a constructive role in the region."
Aim is also "to sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy know this from a good source.
On 11 August François Richier had entrusted her: ," of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever."
"But we are grateful to them, in spite of all of us."
"This should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16 May 2010 after France.
Nicolas Sarkozy, receives in the Elysée.
In a communiqué it the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria, for thanks its "active role in support of the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will a law dubbed "play the Cinderella," pass, which will ban young people, after midnight online Games, it bolsters them access, so government responsible have implied.
A bill, asking the online games / operators to prevent young people under the age of 16 after midnight the access to these Games, will be submitted to Parliament in December, representatives of families gave and Education ministries.
"Many children play these Games, the whole night, and then have trouble with learning in schools and also in order to lead a normal life during the day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep Jo Rin, with this draft law betrauter Ministerialbeauftragter declared," the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online Games were then again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
Manufacturers companies would have a year time to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
Fasser just to face up to the government to ask the manufacturer, asking for daily access to these Games time limit given lower those young people whose parents, the officials added.
He will just to limit those people who wish to make available free programs that allow for it, the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "wired" countries, and the newspapers report regularly from various events associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in global online Game's competitions.
South Korea had won in November to 58 other Nations four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Cup 2018 / 2022: FIFA appoints the Ausrichterland
In a state of great excitement on corruption suspicions the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday which appoints Ausrichterländer the World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in that order, as well as the lobbying Rangeln influence threaten to push the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain: The issuing 2018 the king discipline FIFA will) in Europe, its traditional stronghold, the 4 candidates (take place: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium.
Issuing 2022 will be then something exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be the first on the African continent by 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue further.
The list of persons) belonging to the Delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff provides the level of economic and political use a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes so threatens to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates set.
After the evaluation report to FIFA, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer bessseren arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of Exekutifkommitees the time of the election is not so important.
The Sunday Times that with the finding of the suspension of two members was Exekutifkommitees (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well have had the chance to have their own country, ruining cradle of football, which have only once the World Cup: In 1966.
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday, when it had an own broadcast, which takes three influential members of Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English authorities in embarrassment that had operated primarily with David Cameron in recent weeks of an intensive lobbying.
The head of government is hoping for a repeat of his predecessor, Tony Blair successful chess train in 2005 for London had made the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
Meet would enhance this intensive use, for the image of England before Kommitee again?
Nothing is less certain, as the duo of Spain and Portugal, there are plenty of assets with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup in Spain 82, 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, during Euro 2004 in Portugal) and the football culture.
But the economic and financial black sides of the two countries may dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal put the chance of Russia, which has become, despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), to the compelling outsider, to rise.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided, at the suggestion of the stating Bezichtigungen the English press denounced "an unfair competition in preparation for the vote 'by Kommiteemitglieder.
"We bewirft it with dirt, we tried to compromise them," Putin wetterte.
For 2022 the United States strengthened by the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favorite.
First economic world power, the FIFA seat main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages compared with Japan and South Korea, which have established a very good project separately.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries who co-organised competitions in 2002.
Another threat: The FIFA World Cup very granting of 2026 for China, which will make the Asian opportunity on 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn with an appearance futuristischer stadiums all registers, FIFA has pursued its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries are a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia might, as well as Japan and South Korea among the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (because of the time shift) have to suffer, the sensitive nerve FIFA.
Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle was being scaled down.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not the slightest hesitation.
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less than that.
Calls a mandate in the Elysée to the next.
The current head of state will be the other candidate in 2012.
But the Offenkundigkeit Mysteriums is not the side of the presidential function, well to face.
So we must act as if the doubts would be henceforth.
In one, as well as in the other direction.
2006, gave supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate was not excluded, without believing itself out.
On November 15 Nicolas Sarkozy assured in any serious Tone, his decision 'at some point in the autumn of 2011 "to take.
That he on Tuesday evening in the Elysée to the UMP parliamentarians the prospect of 'two mandates "would let slip, was disseminated Fieberhaftigkeit, therefore, a little.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far lacking.
The President has only recall that the constitution in 2008 to limit the number of five years of office to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"Their seven and a half years with me still have at worst, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010, "does not believe that I do not think about the stage after that."
His words from the day before yesterday, make it more about the candidate than the previous day, but also no less.
They should provoke comments, then from a double reason.
Accelerating the Wettlaufes the candidature of the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of competition, with Ségolène Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to to unfold.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS early warning as to the challenge.
Bad polls, on the other side.
For the first time the electorate's rights would a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the survey of the BVA / L Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," reacted immediately and careful the context of the prime minister.
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," with shares Mr Raffarin.
"He will always believe that we can prevail," Alain Juppé, who has resigned with Offenkundigkeit corrected.
Euro: The ECB is being forced to keep their purchases of government paper
The final assembly of the Governing Council of the ECB in the past year, should provide an opportunity to identify ways of getting out of the crisis, or at least the Order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to announce, the end of the year to come to its conclusion.
The crisis of European public debt obligation, the central bank in Frankfurt, it certainly can't afford to put an end to the present, too, more than tense situation in the European bond markets, so as not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed yesterday at a press conference held by the ECB, an active role in favour of the resolution of the state's budget deficit in Europe.
It has not dared to say whether it is of the view that the central bank could do even more, for example, through stimulation of its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I am my considerations for my European trade partners above (...."
Mr Trichet, President of the ECB, had been sent the previous day speech in Brussels during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, not much about his plans, preferring instead to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities would put on the secondary market, "and that we see in the Assembly on Thursday," as the decisions are. "
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of treasure chamber was doubled by the ECB last week to roughly 1,35 billion euros.
According to the leaks and some traders to yesterday have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
As a whole, the central banks of the euro system have made since May 2010 purchases of EUR 67 billion euros.
Among the dealers anticipating a Weiterverfolgens of purchasing rate will no doubt (see page 29).
The economists expect no remarkable change even more.
If the bond deals for more than three months will be disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter will have to create more money to the total reserves at freigiebige type, and over a period of a week ago, up to three months.
The economists are already taken today, that this measure will extend even for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on essential nature."
"Otherwise, would they risk new tensions in the short term, to provoke," anticipated Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"One for the course of the first quarter of 2011 fair, progressive exit seems likely," for its part, anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions in the market, the public debt, "the ECB should maintain such a purchase volume of bonds to stimulate the sluggish market," added Norbert Bräms.
Given the nature of the exposure of European banks to the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain, as their presence on the market.
"They must at any price to the Steller the lack of investors to enter the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid on the most vulnerable countries," yesterday, a more important bonds holders verve.
Because if the rates set to soar, the countries would be prevented from even more to reduce their debt or to stabilize.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government in Italy is in
For Italy following a worrying weeks earlier the situation has calmed down yesterday, with the decline the Eckzinsen to 10 years a little.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of the region before seated Giulio Tremonti had described the situation as "unentzifferbar" and expect to hear him have a 'unvorhersagbaren "weekend, which they denied, however, immediately.
Tuesday, at least, the gap could have been achieved with the German interest rates its record from 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk, have risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi in his Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain is due to the German interest rates by 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and the possible contagion from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that in Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain text short, his problem is the part of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen tax receipts that put the state in danger, to be able to meet its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, is an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 2012 of 1.4% in the Senate, although the expected... examining budget with 1.3% and 2% is calculated.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimated that the budget deficit in the next year will amount to 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the government's projected 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%.
Hence the collective turmoil at a new budget, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, to new austerity measures are taken," auditors says Olli Rehn.
The hour Italy will receive the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, the repeat, we already have for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted to the IMF with Italy assured.
"At the moment, there are no problems in either the short or long term, because of Italy despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, that A. R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte be called for, as in other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Remains the question of political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections at the end of March, could be organised.
There is therefore a little good session for a decision in relation to a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of the World Anti crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had highlighted it only yesterday, in a press conference in Paris, said: "I think it has shown that it still on Sunday afternoon, as well as in the evening: The Europeans together keep clear, are ready and committed to defend its currency and its currency area."
Although quite relatively - the withdrawal yesterday recorded in the Savings feet of European government bonds, was grist to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
By a normalisation start may not yet be the speech.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that they could lower the debt annotation Portugal, perhaps the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which - particularly on the banking systems', so the views of economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political time passes a lot more slowly than those of the markets."
European countries, which are both up this gap and also aware of the danger that is hidden, is well aware that the discussions on strengthening existing measures against crises.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and with their counterparts in the wider context of the G20 is going well.
And also in relation to the Groupe and Ecofin meetings of euro at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan the lot of unconventional measures is the backing of countries in the euro zone in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
With regard to the EU's Stability Fund, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling has already begun on Tuesday in Singapour his Asian Tour to inform investors in the Far East on the developments with regard to the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit Fundraising, he is no doubt that on the ground.
First Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU's Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative had entrusted to the Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase in the additional, direct involvement of the IMF funds mobilized.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, are in part, structural reforms, particularly in the area of the labour market.
Reforms, which are supposed to be added to the savings, show effects, however, in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than Greece and Ireland, have done.
Both the one, and the other is to be avoided at any cost to have to ask for international assistance before they have established their own budgetary corrective and decided on essential structural reforms, which restores them in the long term the trust.
European investors in turn discuss the available options to accelerate the process of market normalization of government bonds.
Axel Weber, was on 24 November in transit in Paris, was created as the first, the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would be mobilized billion euros not enough, the European Union would not hesitate to attack again in their own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, are sufficient in terms of the market for European public debt on an exceptional player, would be an extension of about 100 billion euros, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
This means exists: The European mechanism is being financial stabilisation, currently 60 billion euros.
An RAC, which has every opportunity to be looked at closely in European capitals.
Especially if worse, the market conditions.

In the affected departments snow cover of 2 to 5 inches, in places even expects 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 inches in the Paris region.
Affected the regions Charente, and Charente Maritime, coasts d Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Basse Poitou and the regions's Normandy, the Ile de France and Limousin.
The snowfall are remarkable enough to cause movement disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
In the region 'coasts Armor several regional routes are closed to heavy traffic from about 7.5 tonnes, including the transport routes Guingamp the Lannion and Saint Brieuc / Loudéac.

The Prefecture 'urges the drivers to the utmost caution on the roads, as well as the appropriate adjustment of their driving. "
The Directorate General for Civil aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their by the Paris airport Roissy Orly airport and 10% of the flights from start to finish because of the expected heavy snow.
DGAB recommends the air passengers to contact their airline.
London Gatwick airports in the south, as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: First financial vignettes
Since the debate is to modernise the transport industry, on the Ile de France in full swing, it is raining billion.
At least in the discussions.
We call here, especially in the 23 billion for the underground Grand Paris in memory, which is intended by the Société du Grand Paris be built.
To launch at the start of construction - the SGP in the way that the state has declared a Kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical framework that is the amount of money that would enable the SGP then to give the markets some of the financial sum to their Zweifachen.
Today it is, after all, to initial projections.
The supplementary budget by 2010, seeing this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, that contains the proposed measures to raise the first part of that money.
There are two measures: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile de France.
The former, so remove one Article 15 of the bill, is "in favor of the public service channel Société du Grand Paris."
This is estimated that "the product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Zweitere an overhaul of existing corporate taxation is: 'To modernise them, in order to increase the price of their product, and to transfer this increase of Société du Grand Paris ."
How much would make it?
A mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
Of the 4 billion it is far away.
"It is being said that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euro of Kapitaldotation, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris be done gradually to the project," as suggested in the explanatory statement.
In the SGP is this system does not take place at all offensive.
"Since the moment in which we (entered revenue the two taxes, or R.), you can meet the study over three years, and then draw from the 4 billion," it is claimed.
"That will be taken in the budget and diverted after and after '.
The SGP estimated that in 2013, will be launched, the 4 billion for the budget in 2014 to take note of.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions of people will be able to look for a long time, is in danger of a very eventful, causing parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
WikiLeaks the affair has a twofold significance.
On one side, they turned out to be a very obvious scandal, a scandal that is simply a scandal the Sinner hypocrisy which the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press run.
On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the regression dominated by the future.
But we go after the series.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service produced acts (any nation is composed) exclusively from newspaper cuttings.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw nothing more than what we got through months anyway to read in any other journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Kabarettkünstlern Gaddafi's has provided for a very long time for their Sketche fuel.
The rule, according to the secret dossier must comprise merely known news, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes' le's Chateau to Templer or Rosenkreuzler repeatedly) exactly what was written in previous works.
This is not only so that the author wishes to occult texts not publish research (or that he did not know where news about) would find it not exist, but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus to think of anything other than what they already know and confirmed what they have already learnt.
Mechanism this is also the success of Dan Brown.
As the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited intellect) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he would be whatever, editor of Libération, for example), which considers only be true, which he acknowledges.
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, the US Embassy in Rome sent the Staatsdezernat had, were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
Why such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier was therefore made?
On one side of this effect what any educated person knows already and the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and, since then, too, may be able to call for the Government to each other or an aircraft companies have been able to take at the dinner - have lost their diplomatic functions and turns, with the exception of a small representation tasks in espionage centres.
Any spectators of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not happening from hypocrisy that people act to ignore it.
Yet: The fact that we are repeating it public, violated the duty of the hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light.
In the second place, the idea that a yet any hackers to tap into secret mysteries of the most powerful country in the world, there is a significant blow to the prestige of Staatsdezernats.
Moreover, the scandal brings fewer victims than the "executioner" in trouble.
But we devote ourselves the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, to Orwell's times, we have been able to concentrate all power as a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy would be able to turn out ever since as absolutely right, where they can control every movement, thanks to the phone, making any transaction, it was hotel, the elected motorway, and so on; the citizen would the total victim to the eye of the power.
If you have, but what is happening today, even the secret Krypten of power no longer can escape the scrutiny of Hackers, the Kontrollgang ceases to be unilaterally and will circle shaped.
Power controlled every citizen, but each citizen, or at least of the hacker - chosen as the avenger by the citizen - that the secrets of power can bring in experience.
But how a power can keep, which is no longer able to protect its own secrets?
True, Georg Simmel said that a real mystery is an open secret (and a hollow secret can never be exposed); it is also true that whatever knowledge about the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel's, in fact, is a mystery without Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but disclosed by WikiLeaks style that the secrets were empty secrets by Hillary Clinton means depriving them of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this snub caused to such a great power?
It is obvious that the state would be in the future, no reserved more information would be put online - the one on the street corner angeklebten displaying.
But it is to be hoped is equally obvious that it is with the latest technologies in vain to keep confidential reports of telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a aircraft move and one of his colleagues has contacted.
How could be maintained in the future private and only for certain ears some relations?
I know very well that my prediction sounds, at the moment, according to science fiction and Roman prison, but I find myself having to imagine the government agents in secret manner assiduous on uncontrollable march routes moving, their communications have nowhere else than on mere memory in order and also the few written information they get, in the shoe (verbergend.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: Basically of espionage attempt of Watergate had been less success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write, that the technology is advancing today, like a cancer - backwards.
A century after the wireless telecommunications Graf had revolutionised the communications, the Internet, with a reconstructed Telegrafen (telephone) wire.
(Analogue) video tapes had the film allows them a film auszukundschaften band for broadband by the (in numerical) CDs enable spulen from behind, you could forward and reveal all the secrets of installation, while today, nothing else than to jump from chapter to chapter, at macro chickens.
With high speed trains, one travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this means of switching by plane, including three and a half hours.
It is not therefore exceptionally that return policy and communication technology in cars and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times what have been forged for secrets between the messages tried to understand the press.
At present there are the messages ask for confidential information by the press.
Climate: As France, its financial promises of talking
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty is there to investigate time referred to the observance of the funding promises quickly resolved (even 'fast start' or premature funding), which have been implemented by the developing countries.
And the rough French vulnerable to blandishments are discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty the developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France) 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year.
At the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled out all the stops to prevent their partners from the fact of its commitment regarding the 'fast start' financing to persuade: Detailgetreuer action report of its Member States, press conference, as well as large events, brochures distribution.
Operation transparency is estimated remarkable and precisely for its real value: The developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries did the same at the same accuracy level.
The EU declared, to have a release of EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, as it is on the right path towards Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
If you look into the details, however, things are slightly more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional use was introduced to be without, to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus, what "means new and additional."
While the EU Commission proposed a harmonisation, have a certain number of members states, including France, to block the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he deems best.
The EU Commission, has chosen as a benchmark for example those of 2009: The international funding to be maintained, and that is in the context of funding 'fast start' 150 million over three years.
Other countries have similar guidelines, either elected in annual or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid.
By contrast, France was the view that the funding "of all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there are no guidelines for spending of the previous year, or at a global level of public development aid.
Specifically said may be the sum total of the French support for developing countries is stable (or decrease) - France is to meet its commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule, and everyone chooses its Rechenmodus.
Some, such as France, are borrowed €1 as being equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously this is acceptable only difficult: The trouble is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be for some profitable investment (often justified to the emission control linked projects) are based on the most effective technology, it is captured deceptive to present the Euro to be donated as equivalent for a euro... moreover, only the cost of the loan should be counted for capital donor country than commitment, in other words, the equivalent of an interest rate.
France has nothing but respect different in spirit than the following observation: '"Accorded its obligation of 420 million euros, by embracing 91.5% loans (389,8 million) and of 8.5%)) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document, to see for yourselves.
France is the only land the EU, that loans to a great extent.
Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (including) perform their obligations to be 100% of donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet their commitments, that France is barely 10 cents and understands, including a similar commitment.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all France operates in his fast start financing with a double fraud: A part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time, and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France will be able to give the impression that it has used 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with his promise, and it saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems likely that there was Bercy, which has conducted the arbitrage) one could draw to borrow twice negative effect, once EU internal (why the other members states are continuing with the donations, if enough?), and then in the negotiations, the developing countries will not be fooled completely...
The chapter of Premature finance only a small matter in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate.
But it may be too much of the drop in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As it always was, it is vital to learn the lesson from this first year of premature funding.
Primarily France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for his obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all France could lead the discussions on the dispute are the subject of long term funding forward (another key topic, and at the moment: You cannot escape the question of 'Verrechenbarkeit "or the recording nature of its loans.
France could alter its position, in order to be as progressive in terms of the contentious issues, as it is the other things.
The hope is based on the new environment minister, Kosciusko / Morizet who will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the 'fast start of France and his vision of' Verrechenbarkeit ," as well as the use of loans would increase inherently international trust, the need for further discussion.
Alarm - of children held pesticides
A child of 10 years, on the day, taking 81 different chemical substances, a this Wednesday of the unification Générations futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations) published study.
The association, which explains that its results "given the small number of samples analysed statistically not reflect significant value, but illustrate nature of the problems are dealt with," the usually within four, from a nearly 10 years to the meals, baby food consumed had bought between July and September, plus a meal in supermarkets in the Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the formal recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts three milk products, and 1.5 litres of water per day - were investigated, as well as biscuits by laboratories searching for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
Record the plate is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 or probably classified as possibly carcinogenic and five than sure klassifizierte, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin karziogen and discordant, according to studies of various institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually had substance is in virtually all cases are not exceeded, then we remove this collection very well that the reality is that, in the face of the consumer may be carcinogenic substances and substances with Endokrinin and discordant, worrying," the association said.
Already at breakfast the butter and the tea with milk alone contain more than ten of potentially carcinogenic residues and three can sure as a proven carcinogen, as well as more than 20, which affect the hormonal system.
Brazil imported apple than expected between meal for the study contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including the lunch, where the study has identified traces of Insektizids strictly banned in the EU.
It also Hacksteak, of tuna from the Pandora, even the Baguette and gum were also full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses have made the presence of nitrates and Chloroform to light.
At the dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified, chemical residues on the "richest," and even of the Aufwärmen the meal in the microwave used plastic plate was not unencumbered.
The final finite risk that "pollutant cocktails" for consumers "will probably undervalued," the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie's Les Verts" (EE / LV) has proposed itself "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the increase in diseases of civilisation. "
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to be identified, had the presence of residues 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
