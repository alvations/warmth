What should they do, the ČSSD? the Czech Social Democrats in Prague are not aware of Voldemort, "Konditorei."
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers should overcome their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the town of representation to understand at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has become established, in which the current coalition partner in Prague at the helm.
The codierte vocabulary, in the long era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the most well-known actors, situations and Causae borrowed.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new concepts somewhat in the dark.
They claim At least.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more of a newcomer in the Prague politics", Lukáš responded Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary".
But also the Council Mr Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way.
For example on the concept of 'golf hole ".
"This is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use now and then."
"otherwise, I think that not much of slang."
From the vocabulary of the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the choice Congress of the ODS had published the editorial staff picked six concepts, particularly with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should the concepts' Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole, "" go in the bull necks "," betrayal of the capital "and" verblechen ".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future leader of the Prague school system - beginning his participation in the talks, but then not even the headphones.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset
"These are things I don't care and how the Civic Democrats themselves talking about - I do not."
"For me, it is how we understand our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, would have Lukáš Kaucký mentioned in the above headline claim not recognised by the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-mayor who was Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, which he correctly guessed at the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to safety but added: "But I rather know this from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will probably have to show a language course."
"The golf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also by the town councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý senses even where this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei
"I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague restaurant company to go Plachý quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that it is the seat of Janoušeks firms.
In line with Březina, but he claims that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspapers, rather than him this vocabulary would own.
The test participants, judging by the Social Democrats, in fact there seems no similar eingebürgerten slang.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something we really not."
"We call on our behalf, sometimes we use words or nicknamed", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party to "Hulda".
"In school I was Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us Karel Březina his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold - it works.
Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "Opa" or less friendly to the 'old', the representative Miroslav poche, ahead of the elections by machinations of the party's sponsorship, some Members' Igráček "(known Czech Lego-figure).
Moniker is the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language.
Hulínský may not, "Hulda ', but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheons-rights" has alleged that Petr Hulínský his title juris doctor in the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witch" and gave a booklet
Women in Burkina Faso to branded witches, usually some common social features.
They include more of the older generation, they cannot find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women to witch, they will be strictly isolated the rest of the village is not dangerous.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"Young and healthy women is spared this, since they help in the work and to bear children," describes a Orden sister the situation in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim takes care of more than a hundred women were emitted by their communities.
The local government has decided against these abnormal "social measure".
And, for this reason, a brochure, which is designed to prevent "witch hunt".
But there is a catch.
"More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read", the newspaper "on the problem of the written information.
To be accused of witchcraft, but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová tortured to death by three women and two men - with Petroleum and burned.
On this incident, among other things, the EuroLaw BBC.
The perpetrators claimed, however, the matter would be just a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version is oil, to ritual Salbungen.
And, after the group sought, "a an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witch" supporting the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso," Fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat today, "he said
While the government has at least tried to defuse the witch-hunt, the Gambia niche in Burkina Faso President last year the President himself mitgemischt properly.
"President Yahya Jammeh revived after the death of his aunt, a monstrous witch-hunt, since these supposedly share whose death made and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called Schamane from the near Guinea to help, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the bodyguard of the President's indiscriminately treat detained men and women from Gambia niche villages kidnapped and on the farm in Kanilai expressed", the organisation Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm were forced from prison, a Absud plant with halluzinogener effect to drink, but also bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arretierten people survived the stay on the farm.
Just because of international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: He fueling the kiln, yet pays higher rent
An elderly untersetzter man just leaves the clients centre of the society RPG Byty of "Kohlebarons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a file with three new rental agreements to three homes: For the own one and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who has just served a prison sentence.
All three in the context of the so-called "deregulation"
Instead of 3,500 kronor per month to rent the son next year for a two-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not fluent in the apartment once hot water and heat must be in a simple coal stove," if he angered the finger at the new lease of the son, whose signing he has a power.
"But what I signed," he says half annoys and half resignedly.
The citizens association BytyOKD.cz the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new agreements not to sign simply and to wait until 7 December at which it intends to publish guidance as it combats such contracts.
But the man beckons only.
"One says this, the other the", it makes a benighted face.
The region Ostrava becomes the large "deregulation laboratory" so.
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not been highly marketable pay rent.
Aktuálně.cz, therefore, this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday full.
Alongside the door the Bodyguards a safety agency and a call.
"Rent" in 2011, so is a special Tastfeld Touchscreen.
Short angetippt and already spuckt the device a list of numbers.
We have Hardly decoded the number "157" and they the large display from the ceiling of the waiting area.
Half a minute later in the series.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is obviously not the new rent.
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve, repairs, insurance and so on.
As of mid-November fly in the region Kuverts Ostrava with the new rental agreements with the most tenants of a total of 44.000 apartments in the portfolios of the RPG in the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty suggests them in the letter a rent increase of around 15 to 38%.
The special counter for the new hire in the clients centre is opened since 18 November.
"The action is a little over a week, which means that this is only the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" as a journalist dictator.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' apartments are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the parliament vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek being from Ostrava of the CSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder, then, that the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years of them I want a new floor."
"Not even ne besch. WC-tinted spectacles, they were able to change" the aforementioned man air.
Until now, according to the staff, especially pensioners on counters, in order to convince whether they really receive the promised rent reduction which promises them if they Spezialangebot sign in time.
In a half reduced February rent the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December sign.
Until now, "switch" in Havířov but anything other than overloaded of questions.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 for here appreciate the counters officials.
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual Mietvereinbarungen, where it appears necessary.
But they will not agree to the new rent, the set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only viable and legitimate legal approach to understand," said RPG on its websites.
"No one goes to court," says one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man in the street in front of the client centre gives it at least partly right.
"I have 13.000 (kroner) pension, it left me 5,000 eating, where I should the money for a legal dispute," he says.
Then the employee but uncertain.
"Time."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and people still waiting for it," she notes.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of the rent is not enough for maintaining the Wohnfonds from," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the Wohnungs portfolios of society RPG Byty and - particularly those of the disgruntled tenants criticised the neglect of the housing fund, according to the homeowner was the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rent collected four billion in housing could invest in the four years from 2011 to 2014 to 5.2 billion.
In the large format 'LCD display from the ceiling to the Polstersesseln in the waiting room of Havířov appear staged is always a few red shining information.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means most 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is on the LCD screen to read.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG has increased the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is to the increase of extremely low rents from 19,66 CZK per square metre," argued RPG.
In 2600 homes remains the rent at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation rents not spectacular, but gradually within four and eight years ago.
What more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants it back in the houses, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation.
But, primarily to those people who are the agreements on the rent increase sign.
The architects saw - the office is also a nursery
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini nursery here already, with all that entails: Colourful walls, creative furniture, toys and even a mini-playground on the Außenterrasse.
This nursery is available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The Projektierungs- and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose Ateliers a number of prominent Brünner buildings are expected of the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for mini nursery.
Wise in, because most of his 90 staff (inside) are in the baby boom-era and the company is keen that the Projektantinnen and architect home as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility, shortened to work, the nursery is another bonus, the Arch.Design its employees in the concept of social program to offer.
The structural engineer and -architektinnen have made it easier to its ambitious work and child care to reconcile.
The mini nursery is an original idea of employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded financial assistance from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for its project.
The company mini-kindergarten through the operational programme human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget in the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting to 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment and for the duration of 2 years is for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the exhaustion of the subsidies (2 years) the society Arch.Design is committed to the mini nursery 3 more years at their own cost.
The preparation of this project has a full year, although the company economy rating in the application processing active assistance.
Takes care of the children Subcontinent, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the nursery children can moderate without age restrictions, although most of them over three years old.
And since it is about a mini nursery school, only 5 children to be present, but alternate the day on several children each other.
The nursery is operational flexibility to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the the without regard to the companies and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini nursery nevertheless comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education.
The Children play not only here, especially will offer excellent teaching - ranging from basic knowledge to Vorschulunterricht, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative Games, but also with a computer, which is available to the children.
What is more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children and so is the stress in the collection of the late children from a remote nursery.
So the parents use their working time more productive.
No wonder that also natural and loyal employer-employee relations.
Arch.Design reihte so under the Czech companies in the recruitment of new staff to offer significant benefits ", the familienfreundlich by such programmes and their staff marketing.
A bone House fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi
The roof appears to the backs of prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone are aufgerissene Fischmäuler.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with his organic forms the nicknames "bones house."
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and mosaic, the scales facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the House plays with wonderful lines, gentle colors and textures that remind of nature and living creatures.
Only On closer inspection we noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole façade, plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours.
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House.
Waves geformtes wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and trade.
The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created from the rebuilding of a House from the year 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese said.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a wholly new building, but he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The rental house Casa Batlló devised Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together.
Just On the drawing board created the Dekorationen for the representative housing of the Realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaics of the façade was his idea.
In the design of the facade, but also many other Bildner and artists with.
The joint work on the drafting of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the park Güell where other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the home of the local inhabitants got the nickname "bone house" because of his organic forms.
Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House".
It also says that the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, of the existence of Catalonia.
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system unique for the time for the House with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kaminen.
Something weird is their 45-degree slope already.
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and did not influence this.
Before the start of construction - although he absorbed from the the city of it claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers were two years later so horrified by the result that they remedy.
Gentlemen of the Council found that among other things, that the construction with its pillars even in the public pavement intervening.
To amendments, however, it was not quite the opposite - just 15 days after the call of the urban community, Josep Batlló a submitted an application to the approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the house - and was promptly.
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors.
In the gallery in the 2 Stock was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms of the house.
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller.
The whole sechsstöckige buildings undergoing a steps up to Dachterrasse.
The main elements of the redevelopments were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of rooms.
The social part through the opening of Salontüren completely combine and greater society chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren on talks with a certain degree of intimacy.
The House received by Gaudís retrofit except a new facade of a very unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressive is also Gaudís game with the light, and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln with which the courtyard dressed and light.
The game of these two colours gives maximum light all floors of the House.
He made simply use the principle, that white better reflects the light and dark colors, sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, in 2005 the World Heritage List Unesco, everyone can now visit.
The first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste home made available to the public.
The homeowner decided only in the years on this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator.
As we noted that this is a very profitable business, it has retained the surveys, and extended it to other common and the Dachgeschossräume, including the Dachterrasse.
The price for the inspection of the monument is no trifling matter, however, he is EUR 16,50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20% reduction.
This figure exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí-buildings in the city.
Anyone Who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the House with his Drachentürmchen should try to close friendship with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other desires than men
Not the tollste bed framework, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and rust make the good bed.
These are, however, ways to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the choice many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers.
Equally important is the Interieur where mattress and rust.
Typical example?
In a Wochenendhaus, not regularly heated, are not well suited since they are much longer, "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane foams mattresses.
And, it should be changed regularly.
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the heart and still have a strong record, is congested and moisture, so it is not ruled out that the tape.
In the election Of course also plays a role, to what one is used.
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"All you get from the NHL have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep right here."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer from Visco-foam (memory Foam - a form of memory-polymer)."
"Among other things I recommend these to also diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and the skin is bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, furniture.
Therefore I have many years ago Eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this mattresses with Visco-foam (memory Foam) concerned.
"today, it is no longer a problem, because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico
And one does not need to be a famous you get the benefits of the Visco-foam learn to appreciate.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt downright warm body.
Nowhere is there, in the night one does not roll around as after a serious fight.
It is simply sleeping much better.
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene).
In the choice of the Matratzengröße should be to height is still the length of the Fußsohlen add some 21 to 34 inches.
A man and woman in the 180 cm are big need as a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available, is 180 cm.
In Einzelbetten, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm.
The comfort and also for the visitors.
Otherwise the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine. Helena Prokopová, the guild masters of the and Raumausstatter for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this discussion at a university.
In a double bed everyone needs a own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are too high.
Otherwise there is nothing different amounts than the Roste assembling and this is not possible in every bed framework.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion.
"With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers on no account should we felt", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress makes a special Rosttyp.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and under position as evolved Siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be let drop and the reference you cannot wash, today already.
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and sieve).
Even so, experts advertising slogans in mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, yes even lifelong guarantee.
Every cause has its ifs and buts.
And so a practical Council by dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm diameter the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, easy and washing.
Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss manufactured so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They have in bed instead of a Rostes firm record?
Get out of it.
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
So they should record to provide ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pockets of the core and finely cushion.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a pad.
For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are suitable Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), keep pay this Roste with a larger Lattenanzahl, of 28 and more Federleisten from, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte.
On verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with the skeleton, since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
Alongside the attitudes of stiff the pen will make special flexible shoulder modules.
This is a special strengthen the pen, which allows the einzudrücken or even afford to verwinkeln that they allow the individual Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter.
There is even Matratzenhersteller which have started to use soft Herrenmatratzen "zones for the shoulder area.
Also to the ladies is thought - they are fighting these soft zones in the Hüftgegend.
For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing stroke systems (Lattoflex) or Roste burden with points of contact-Pads with so Multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure will be distributed on several points, thus reducing the tension.
But, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too big and fülliges), most are used Kopfkissen benefits lost.
Here too, a rule of thumb: The to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles relax.
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians.
In the side of the head cushion (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the bed) the shoulder height.
Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (fat) Strohsäcken but with hay.
Modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Also In the new magic word "organic".
Instead of oil raw materials used to manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly natural oils - for example Rizinus- and soya oil.
Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Organic mattresses, which is in its core of materials purely natural origin is," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials, but also in the production of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But one can also micro-capsules grant to sleep, Mr President fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread.
Here too there is a difference between men and women.
While the men a "cool" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern used so that the Matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "wärmende" effect.
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex when sleep wohlig warm.
And the current favorites?
Mattresses from cold sparkling (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the various stiff (tough) of cold foams and from know exactly, where head, hip and heels.
For a high-quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7,000 kronor and more.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower value added tax, because they are regarded as medical device.
The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage.
You see, in the bed and the pair to save is not so easy.
There are special offers of manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco-foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second will be free to do so.
It was the material Tempur which the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace.
No surprise, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts.
Tempur is in heat soft, cool environment cemented it again.
So it is to the human body perfectly and distributed the body printing in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of fires increased pressure, but generally the sleep of comfort.
Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and the vessels to provide relief.
Local producers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want Menschen-Überwachungsgeräte in order to have the kids under control
The fear for our own children, and so consider more and more parents to control them by GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to hunting down cars, can just as well people locate what would be helpful also in such cases, as the disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková.
The device is about as big as a packet of cigarettes but soon it will be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the missing Anička in a funk and so they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the cost of a violation of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that it is not around Pioneers, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it will lead to the tragedy", Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it cannot abuse of such devices, for example, if you know someone in the pocket, without it, but so far we have had no such case."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons", adds Pilin.
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency.
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková notes, however, that a child, if there is such a thing it simply emptied.
"Even very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be checked."
"The phones awoke initially great expectations among parents, but they can be just as easy, as this new surveillance equipment," says Mrs Bočková.
That is also controversial, whether such a body in the event of an attack actually help.
"At planned abduction, the kidnappers almost always checked whether the child has any electronics, it could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"If such monitoring equipment wider use, they also found, since their sales will be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
It acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful.
Roberta Čech RC monitoring by society, according to the tracking service offers both for cars and for individuals, the existence of such a device then, when it immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted namely so that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed, at least the final position of the person concerned."
"In more expensive equipment is Even a Neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if you are going hinfällt and movement, the device sends a warning immediately indicate the position," said Mr Čech.
In his view, similar services could also smart phones with navigation, it just needs a special software einzuspielen.
The problem with the current positioning devices is that it is either equipment in matchbox-size, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that it loses.
Mr Pilin of the Macro because according to tests in the present, devices, which look like ordinary digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the possible attackers do not realise that it is a monitoring and tracking device.
"Or he realises what the police only after a certain time, a time lead there," he adds.
No matter which way the trend is towards Armbändern - or, as always, the same technology used in vehicle tracking.
So the combination of positioning function through the GPS system (just as the Ms in the car) and the function of a mobile telephone which the current position.
The army has so many Zündschnüre quite the Czech Republic that umwickeln could you but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers Zündschnüre shopped with explosives were to be released.
The year Before, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles powder to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years ausgesorgt.
The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group, including For paltry 40 million kronor.
In his reason for the purchase of this enormous amount of powder said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would use per year to the 60 kilometres powder.
According to the research from Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised is clear from this data that the whole army of an intensive year pyrotechnic training - all generals and officers of the army commandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only then could the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometers Zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length to 25,000 Detonationen.
But even if this army inventory for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of each new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years.
It complained soldiers of the quickly use Brigade recently, in the Defence Minister Vondra, they have almost no more cartridges for hand guns, so register are severely restricted because of the lack of resources.
Not to mention the Unterhosenmangel.
"Me is not why they are such huge sums Zündschnüre buy."
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as traders to do as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army could so for at least ten years with this
Jan Děcký of the STV Group but talks only of a four-year duration of the Zündschnüre and police and Armeepyrotechniker only two years.
"With perfect storage are also mentioned possible four years", one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the expiry of the term use any ammunition to be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and must not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers powder.
"It cost us 60% less than last year's supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother army exceeds some years has barely 1,500 metres.
And the police always order just such quantities of ammunition it before the end of the Gebrauchsdauer can consume.
The safety of the Pyrotechniker because, in addition, one holds the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable Zündschnüre open.
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern MF DNES raised the Czech armed forces have the same problem in a few years in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre today as "good" has bought.
Until today I have the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition.
The winning placement in the competition "small entrepreneur of the year the franchise of its hotels.
Winner of the last year of competition "small entrepreneur of the year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film script.
Lukáš Pytloun went willingly.
Only abroad he was aware that it lacks good accommodation options at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holidays working abroad and by a bank loan erstand a baufälliges house with five homes.
Considering that he then university student in the sixth semester was, this was surely a daunting.
"The price / quality ratio angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte apartment he rented to foreign workers.
The entire profit he immediately invested back into the house, which he then step by step towards retirement with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then it managed in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec style four pensions, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun design hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the Pytloun franchise-hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"In this licence sales at the behest of hotels had just the victory in the competition" entrepreneur of the year ", adds Mr Pytloun appreciation.
The victory gave him greater fame, popularity in Liberec and surrounding areas.
"The people congratulated me on the street, often they subsequently and I must say that did really well," he recalled.
I really recommend all who want to create something in this competition.
It does not equal to gain any visible is good.
He said that he will benefit from the contacts and acquaintances until today, it would not.
"With some people I have met because of competition, I still maintain regular business relations."
The success of the glory, in his view, even a little on any of its staff.
And since he has the seventy.
"I notice of them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something, the general recognition."
This is the result of the good work of all of us, no, it
"My name is just something to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
I wish my successors a ruhigeres year than we had in Farmet
The victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination has Farmet the worst.
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year last year, Karel Žďárský, the company owners of Farmet.
The jury then paid tribute to the effort with which he is from the small Werkzeugbau in Česká Skalice a company from the ground stampfte that hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this not only myself but also encouraged all my staff and our self-self-confidence in the fight with the competition", says last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state his father Karel Žďárský as compensation for the loss of property confiscated by the Communists a small workshop to the lease, he did not hesitate for a long time, his career in the firm, in which he has been employed by then and was founded with a few friends of his father, a separate company to produce Plastikwannen.
A short time later, they started to focus on vegetable oil squeeze.
Within 18 years, they are the largest manufacturer of automatic Pressen across central Europe.
But the success in the competition and its Medialisierung it is also aware of the non-specialized public.
"Not only that our customers the brand Farmet now clearly intensive exercise, including our foreign partners began the fact, to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success to attach greater value in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
The Last year was in Farmet, however, not only in the euphoria of victory.
The tribute came from the economic results of the company in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And 2009 has been the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, still less the citizens but, above all, particularly schüttelte reached its peak, many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"This situation we could not escape."
"The sales declined by 40 per cent, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs," said Karel Žďárský
A viable companies must sometimes such unpopular measures.
But managed to get a grip on the situation and to keep the company in the black figures, although lower profits than before the crisis.
When the company was not prepared to make cuts in investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, bestärkten our presentation at international fairs and Hauptpreise in domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing, and with them, the number of new staff.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory, but in more calm," Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll, removing nonsensical regulations
The survey "the absurdity of the year" is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical rules were already from the face of the earth.
The winners of the dubious next year round the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" has the duty to documents to authorities, the Online are available.
So more than a third of not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the register, even if the officials had access by two Mausklicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll is changing now.
"The Czech social security administration will in future when controls of Sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the commercial register asking for more," the spokesman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the survey "absurdity" of the year, it is all rules and orders to entrepreneurs have to meet in the Czech Republic and lift the nonsensical.
This is the fourth time this year as part of a business competition, the tsch. Business newspaper (HN) is organized and growing popularity in public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No surprise, because there are still a lot of legal obligations only serve to hinder the business.
"For example, the number of income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world," said Karel Havlíček from the Association of small and medium-size companies and businesspeople in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity in the last few years the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank is the Czech Republic in relation to the Unternehmensbedingungen the 74 th one, as compared with the previous year worse placing.
The competition absurdity of the year was for the first time in years and every year after the same scenario.
We can all of April to print of competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
The website address To register www.firmaroku.cz. after the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public Internet websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
It let the absurdity of the most votes.
For this year's opinion poll were already more than a hundred, 105 senseless rules and orders.
The clues come not only from employers, but also of professional organizations and journalists.
Among the nominated "Fina list" of competition, including provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and fast road tolls have to pay or that employers with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November on the Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of a Happenings, the leaders of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of small or medium-sized businesses and businesspeople. Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of commerce of the Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the game.
"Where the state is the entrepreneurs spanner into the works, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal to lift every year at least thirty entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their businesses," said Martin Kocourek, the minister of industry and trade.
The efforts of nonsensical orders from the world to make effective.
In 2007, initially the people most concerned the duty imposed on entrepreneurs, the Gewerbeamt permanent company three days in advance to notify the intention, with an exhibition to an exhibition or Kirmes drive.
This duty was under a review of the business law.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes - the duty in 2007, the labour office so-called "green card" missions by workers in the scope for up to 30 days to notify - was removed by the law on the
And - all good things come in threes.
The absurdity of 2009 was elected, the regulation which it imposed physiotherapists, in Sprechzimmer a mirror, a refrigerator and two Personenwaagen.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the fridge duty fell away.
A new category validates socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition between economic newspaper (HN) is the category "responsible company of the year 2010".
Basic idea of this competition is reasonable and fair ventures.
"We want to support such firms, who are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and socially responsible initiatives, says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, and competition" Rebel of the year ".
This year "s first year in this special category of the main competition Vodafon company of the year for whom the success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ in regard to the subject of their activities diametrically opposed, yet their efforts have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here it is, for example, gehandicapte people, because of personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the fourteen Fina lists from across the Czech Republic appeared as, for example, the Prague software company et Netera on the emergence of non-formal sport teams among their staff, then at many tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region Pardubice is the society Isolit bravo, for the already seventeen years main sponsor of a trust fund for gehandicapte children.
A paper mill from Poděbrady cares exemplary for their disabled employees in health terms, which represent 70 per cent of its workforce, entitled "responsible company in the region central Bohemia" was celebrated in the competition Vodafone company of the year did it the third place in the framework of this region.
In the region Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz soft, including a fluid and also to an average of 35 hours per week reduced working time and this without cutting wages.
The jury in the title honorierte award, the fact that the company mainly in Czech manufacturers buy, citizens' initiatives in their area and environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the consequences of our business activity and administration for the environment," says their business leader Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT companies Enlogit from the region Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is committed to the health of its workers and that is why it has them all note Books ergonomische chair and Tastaturen purchased, also encourages them to their employees work at home and in corporate actions used carte ring-services, protected by a domestic garage.
"In addition, we support the foundation" people in need, "the local Roma Kommunität concrete assistance," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least is the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region, their employees in the form of extra Bonussen contribution to their pensions.
"We give our workers contributions to drink, to get to work, to increase their skills and for the holidays," says Joseph Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch-Silesian Region.
The category responsible company of the year were automatically all district Fina lists of competition Vodafon company of the year, the issues of the notification enclosed questionnaire beantwortetet and at the latest by the 15.August the organisers zuschickten.
Wrong or incomplete full answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the organisers of the assessment.
"If the representatives of the competing companies the unanswered questions, they were excluded from the competition" responsible company of the year ", in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were so but not disqualifying.
"A separate registration only to this competition is not possible, because he is merely a sub-category of the main competition company of the year," said Karel Goldman of the organizing agency bison & Rose.
Pilsner ground Fund - arrests the police during a public tender
In the building of the ground Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police arrests in recent days.
It was the local media entrepreneurs and real estate dealers Luboš G. of the Detektiven in handcuffs.
These had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition to be held just Restitutionsansprüchen processing so that the competition offered plots a specific zufielen interested.
This should Luboš G. paid for half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition is," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutors' Právo further details could not provide it in terms of the ongoing investigation.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman from the police.
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, we can only speculate, given the lack of official information.
The spokesman of the soil fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have Pilsner of soil Fund arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was a client and not one of our employees' defined her.
The public competition, according to Mrs Černá had the correct name 'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the law "and would take place in cases in which several applicants offered interest in the land bezeigen.
"These people are in the context of the transfer to request a higher value of begleichenden Restitutionsansprüche than the proclaimed land value."
"In accordance with the offer entitlements will determine the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the soil fund the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokesman of the fund.
Luboš G. were obviously provide information to those who request had notified and because he was justified in person as he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a property interests in that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in to arrest him.
Luboš G. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund.
So He also played in the issue of the former head of the ground fund Václav Sankota a role has been prosecuted because he Ersatzrestitutionen plots, which already made location decisions were taken.
At the time Luboš G. acquired the land fund, for example, land to build public roads were intended to be precise, more specifically, in the place where the construction of the area Borské Pole was planned.
Later He exchanged this very favourably with the government against a house directly in the historic center of the city, the value of the land far exceeded.
The local authority had gone back with a heavy heart, which works by blocking the land.
The cost of living in households rise by several hundred per month
The budgets from January to not only with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and sewer fees and for district heating and in some places.
Families are so from January SEK several hundred more per month from the wallet than we have before.
Electricity is more expensive, gas up 4.6 per cent to 2 per cent and more in some cities, it will be up to a tenth have to pay more for water supplies and some expensive district heating supplies.
Only the current price increase costs the housing budgets every year several hundred kronor.
The high electricity prices were reduced by all the main providers, is to blame so the clear support of electricity from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only moderately expensive, however, if the people most heat must have and have the highest consumption.
So here is with several hundred kronor per year.
While electricity and gas in the Czech Republic will be more expensive, the prices for heating varies from city to city.
Above all, more places are planning price increases.
For instance, we need to households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for distance heating pay up to 50 kronor a month, more than 1,000 kronor per year pay families in Liberec.
The people of Prague, in turn, are 9 percent higher water and sewage charges and this is the case that the city increased the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague is compared to the whole, however, of the Czech Republic remain among the lowest.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges by 7.4 per cent rise.
Huge renting price increases, for example, in 140,000 rental housing to expect that from January the so-called rent regulation.
So for example, Is planning the housing company CPI Byty in Ústí nad Labem 2,500 homes has to increase the rent from January equal to 100%.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase wants the company to court.
The regulated rents, which today still in approximately 300,000 homes pay should increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it is simply too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, once again a good whisky, the father of Hausbar has stolen.
These are the drinks after enjoyed drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most notbehandelt.
Children are No exception, their hangovers the ausschlafen repeatedly in the hospital.
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the opening of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine is completely out of fashion, simply because it takes too long to be drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol", said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the children's unit in the Bohemian clinic Hořovice.
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of Hausbar to snatch, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it blended with juice can smell it not so hard," says the head doctor.
The spokesman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him properly.
"Most 'Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about slivovice, you take home", Mrs Jurinová.
Chief doctor Pelikán, three or four-year-olds drinkers in the hospital admission long is no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice he ten years since this year, he was working in the paediatric-department of the hospital Motol, where the rescue angetrunkene pupils from Middle and distance selling ablieferten.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started your career with 12 years ago, when the first time with 3.5 per mil alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "has been hospitalised," the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"It was in the exhibition site Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing is that it was her mother does not strange found that their daughter came home 48 hours" surprised the chief doctor.
The lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance in Anstoßen with their own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A real dependency in the true sense of the word, according to experts in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children.
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, is mostly a negative family-social background characteristic, "says chief doctor Pelikán.
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, according to Mrs Jurinová until mid-November, was about 40 drunken children in the local department of child and youth medicine.
Yet only the cases of serious alcohol poisoning, a hospital to go in the statistics.
Drunken children after ambulatory care from parents or may be brought home by the police, not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children as only a bottle of spirits in school desk austrinken there are opinion of Mr Pelikán three year time Amplituden, 100% is good: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from pain because of the bad certificate or joy on the holiday."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already seen in the opening seven drunken children at once," said Dr Pelikán.
A betrunkenes child spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child who has to contend with a nasty hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning after the Dehydration and lack of glucose that can be in hospital with a liquid-giving Infusion with glucose and nutrients to the organism is missing.
"Clearly they are better off, because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise them with good humour to somewhere without something hurts."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Dr Pelikán admits, although he sometimes at least good humour to perish by the patients he considers the costs they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue and the night in an acute beds come well on a few tens of thousand kronor.
"Occasionally I have an educational resources used, if I have direct children visit calculated what their drunkenness has cost and that it can happen that they take the whole holiday on must work to earn the money for a single such Fete", added Dr Pelikán added.
In his view, the health insurance funds but not for redress procedures in order to cure the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light aircraft L-159 of a total of five the Czech Ministry of defence against the Casa C-295M transport plane has flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish plane manufacturer EADS Casa - sets.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only manoeuvres or air shows to see.
It is the airline capable Zweisitzerversion L-159T1 by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige L-159.
These are currently einkonserviert in Aero Vodochody, the broker this business - the company Omnipol - it has accepted last week.
When the aircraft physically from Vodochody expediert, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence is not yet known.
The einsitzigen fighter aircraft L-159, long-term stored planes were being singled out and this without further deposits and investment on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry.
"The double-L-159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek the newspaper Právo.
He added, the army will not have to manage without zweisitzige fighter aircraft, because the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million-dollar contract on the reorganization of four superfluous L-159 zweisitzigen version.
A new aircraft, the Army in July, the second wants it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek EADS has the aircraft in the equipment of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS customers of the aircraft L-159, and that this training of pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the Abnehmers how he realised the matter" led Pejšek.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the L-159.
The Barter of five L-159 against a transport plane and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence had had to buy a tender procedure called EADS, but spoke directly.
The former defense office argued that this exchange will support the future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which she uses only 24, she wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will also have a legal process.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of defence indeed at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the aircraft due to a and not by raising a single manufacturer.
The army has already three aircraft Casa, the last to land at the Airport Kbely within 14 days.
A long forefinger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose finger is long, as the ring finger, are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That is the surprising results of a study which was published by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this particular to sixty in men," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men are necessarily a prostate cancer testing should, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, added Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009 followed it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants of the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19% of those men whose vaccination and finger were equally long.
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring finger this risk, however, fell by 33 per cent with men to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers in prenatal age form obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is a long fingers.
Earlier research found that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the academy of Sciences, said ČTK, that he is aware of this study nonetheless, he is the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk have not proved to be "completely".

American soldiers have a new 'smart weapon ".
The American troops have deployed in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon, the only under their Codebezeichnung XM- 25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influenced the conflict there with the Taliban and changes the balance in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a super-precise walnut.
Their projectiles by laser with an accuracy of just a few metres into the goal.
The special bore 25 mm shells that were developed for this gun and dangerous explosives to function effectively as small grenades.
The missiles can be programmed so that they can not only to the target, but at any point their ballistic explode on impact.
That means that you cannot use it against an enemy that hides behind a barrier - a wall or in the trench.
From the top, it is usually not protected, the murderous steel cluster rain can easily top him out.
Richard Audett, according to the development of the XM-25, the new fight gun is the first infantry arm, the 'intelligent' technologies.

400 jobs will be transferred
The company Fujitsu shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year will be 400 employees their jobs from the previous office building on Marienbader place in bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computers and their maintenance specialist industry giant on Wednesday announced in July next year, 400 men and women of their jobs from the previous office building at the Marienbad place in Bad Homburg the Astro Park, this is a great office complex in the Frankfurt district city Niederrad.
A spokesman for Fujitsu said, in the medium term, there should still be another 100 jobs of the group be placed in the region were distributed.
The renting offer was extremely attractive, also would have been the major offices in Astro Park of the workings of the staff better.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu had been only tenants.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, with we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure ".
The excellent link to the airport is just for a global companies such as Fujitsu is of great importance.
The latest move a major company within the region called yesterday joy among the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The Frankfurt Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said a "Global Player" has been won.
It was a "fantastic location commitment".
Fujitsu fits to the city, the location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Green) regretted the decision.
The city early in the management of the intention had been informed.
"We have offered the companies naturally our aid," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts had nothing to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader place.
Ultimately would economic reasons have made all the difference.
Now there is a long empty state in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building cooperative."
The Fujitsu has used House on City Hall and the neighbouring 'small vertical "were with the other buildings on Marienbader place ten years ago to the most controversial works of Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private Projektentwicklers arose between railway station and a new Stadtentree city Hall, both because of the massive building before the car park land and the size of the buildings for criticism.
2001 was the investment advisory and credit-rating companies Feri, the software manufacturers for travel distribution systems, start Amadeus, and then with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu Siemens houses.
The Fujitsu buildings in 2006 from the Frankfurter German real estate opportunities group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu-Konuzern describes itself as the third largest IT-Provider of the world.
It is companies, for example, computers and servers willing and also makes the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine-Main-area is one of the largest in Germany, far more employee counts Fujitsu in Munich.
From bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad a further subsidiaries at this site should be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
Were in the office buildings Astro Park 7000 square metres.
In the 20-year-old complex - the name alludes to his star-shaped outline - has, among other things, the Central Association electrical engineering and electronics industry his seat.
Amazon servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service providers Amazon has banished the disclosure platform of its servers.
There is perhaps political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic telegrams.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is supposedly in England.
The disclosure platform Wikileaks machine in the United States increasingly under attack.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who stands on the wanted lists of Interpol, according to a newspaper report in the UK.
"WikiLeaks Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," shared the Enthüllungs activists by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet company Amazon the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had in the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web services (AWS) order to be able to handle the high numbers on the documents.
By Twitter said the step further: "Prima Wikileaks - our dollars are spent now to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon such problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon have halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman investigations, told the television station CNN, citing the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened a boycott, told the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this action earlier in the face of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks", said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform in other countries to deny the use to servers.
"wikileaks' illegal, hideous and ruthless action puts our national security and endangering lives around the world," it was analysed in a communication of the independent senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to disseminate stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange on suspicion of rape, is being sought by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper the Independent, the 39-year-old Australians in Britain, the exact location is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation as an intrigue of his opponents in Sweden.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London, said there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore Assange rightly fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson reacted to comments from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations tried and executed for treason.
In Canada said a consultant of head Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange "should be killed" and "Obama could use a drone.
Between the White House and Assange, while a tennis match.
The speaker of the American president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has asked the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for recently reported spy-requests to diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than a web page."
The American government is the protection of their databases fully to the test.
As a special envoy is the vice-director of the Center for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers was responsible for "the necessary structural reforms," which the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks necessary.
The White House also want to check the way the whole government information exchange and protection.
The American government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and activists want to ensure that they should by Wikileaks published in jeopardy.
"We have done everything to make contact with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them, if that becomes necessary."
The ice-university
The "gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day course for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world.
Why is actually the whole ice?
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in a little old-fashioned the cream, after all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it abolishes the Waffel and then selling them.
In order to know this, you do not need to Anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who would like to know more about ice, is not "gelato-University" the Italian firm Carpigiani over.
The ice-University has set up the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day course for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world.
But there are also more day Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the domestic Eisdiele.
Some dreams in the midlife Crisis of a new career, other cars simply let the treacherous ice of vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil and Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial
Anke from Berlin is business adviser and after years in a nerve-racking job eintüten.
Two young Egyptians dream in Cairo to open a Eisdiele.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia, because their children Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first of all, the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency.
Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even construction: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step to manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic program everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns to a tap on the machine, and is a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all Milcheissorten.
The teacher immediately with questions: Can ice cream only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein?
Luciano warns, the spirit of the age to be fooled.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", has probably still stabilisers - usually a natural product, such Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day in, and the customer bite on Eiskörnchen louder.
Certain variations in the mass are allowed.
It gets more thrilling with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit-department or the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and Pasten.
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens of aromatic additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in the ice cream from the white Grundmasse, with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder into the basis for all kinds of Schokoladen-Verführungen.
Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen.
Luciano will each have four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and produce Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the mass with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be subject to the Fruchteissorten.
More flavourings, more fruit Püree - geschmacklich is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-eis tastes to nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice, the working group, the more fruit, using less water and less stabiliser.
A balanced mixture stresses the taste of a Gelato properly first, says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For Zitroneneis an extra dose of sugar is necessary.
Luciano a device, with which he prefers the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wine fairs so that the Oechsle in musts).
Fortunately for the calculation of tables.
Ice to make requires not so much physical use as before.
Not only the device for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and cooled on minus temperatures.
Despite all the automated remain accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted him and his colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control.
"In every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time until something happens."
Inspectors in the twilight
The European Food Authority EFSA is with Genpflanzen experimental industry.
This charge now formulated the group of experts Testbiotech which sees herself as an independent institute for the impact of the biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said test biotech leader Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA panel of genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert was for years the lobbyists Ilsi under contract.
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid.
Kuiper was instrumental in the EFSA test requirements for Genpflanzen worked and am in a clear conflict of interests, then criticized.
The EFSA rules are (manner, word for word, with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive the imprint of the industry, which really should be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was the second time that a conflict of interest bemängle test Biotech.
It is a high-level EFSA Managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta, and have changed sides.
The central German radio (MDR) recently had personal links between kontrollierender EU authority and industrial lobby reveals what the Federal Office for as well as EU parliamentarian has made open.
The EFSA can However, see no conflict of interest.
We will take all serious data back to the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement.
The experts who work for EFSA, we ask that they have no contact with the industry.
But they have to disclose them.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby.
In the matter criticize independent experts as then that genetically modified crops currently without any rat-feeding in animals are allowed and the reaction of Genpflanzen environmental influences not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on the field", says then.
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test how artificial no reliable results.
"If one does not seek the risks, how is it then?" Asks then pointed.
It is also Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist research since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical scientists to influence or discredit.
There is therefore hardly researchers, companies are intertwined.
For businesses critical studies would normally not be published.
"The industry is controlling the security research", said Hilbeck.
The track of stones
Uli Gsell has also concerned what totalling approximately 400 kg.
On Monday night he was supreme power station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It snowed.
The story is well known: In September were the dredging angerückt and had started a major piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Thousands marched against S21, billions Tieferlegung the train station.
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing lay in ruins.
Split in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is Bildhauer in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earth."
When he took a aufsägte, after Zigarettenqualm rat.
He does not know What he will do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The track of the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen to a former Munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel Rongen Stein-Reich has built.
The 44-year-olds with old stones.
He has bought all, on the demolition in Stuttgart fell.
"It would be a shame, they would be ground to gravel or in the landfill will disappear", he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a Wachhäuschen.
It was insulted and threatened him, he tells when in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the north wing of the demolition entrepreneur.
But he has talked with the S-21 opponents for days.
And he has said that he now nothing for the demolition.
And if it is, then it is the wisest thing when the stones were used.
About 200 S-21-opponents then took an average of 80 kilos of serious Quader with, Stückpreis 6,50 to 14 euros.
As memory, but some in the hope of him on a reconstruction to be able to return.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From wherever they are and have weggeschleppt what boot and supporters could bear.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have been transformed into "Mäuerle" or in Kräuterbeeten limits.
"This stone Is actually nothing special", says Rongen.
"Would not be in the political component."
He is rising in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares great empire.
He has studied law and halted, later biology, then he is interested in computers and finally stones.
And stone lovers.
he stores 40000 tons of stones.
From across Germany karrt his treasures.
He says he is the greatest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He is slowing down.
In the snow are skilful behauene sand stones.
"They were once the Dresden Marienbrücke," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he he.
"My favorite stone."
It is the way through the forest.
It shows a bunch: Red limestone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once belonged to the gallery of the Neckarstadions Stuttgart Quader.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital.
Which work, which efforts, which sweat.
If Rongen thinks, as the stones were hit by hand and moved with simple block and tackles they were ox carts, he will be very reverential.
"It would be a scandal if it would Schreddern."
He is not rich, rich.
But 14 people employed the Steinhändler today, also have high in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and settled a horticulturalists.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the Resteverwerter.
Soon he must to Cologne.
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
Talent battle for High-potential
There is a lively crush on Buffett.
16 students are salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have the machines construction and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas should they, together with VW developers on the car of the future jargon - and incidentally Volkswagen.
In the competition for the best brains now many businesses in the Nahkampf and how VW, in cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: The smartest graduates as early as possible in the Hörsälen recruit before they enter the job market and pulled by others.
And because the universities no data on the performance of their students, is trying the exceptional talent in practice projects to spot and keep.
On the second day of the workshop at the Tu Brunswick the car company group solicits the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed pens, wine gum and Mappen with VW logo.
She told the promising young talents of training programmes and students jobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico Selle of the Tu Brunswick cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides, "the students come in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can at the same time students, especially interesting candidates at closely and think about who would staff in."
Such cooperation, so Selle, are not unusual.
New is that the students will gebuhlt as aggressively.
"otherwise, the focus was on the technical project", says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many industries, companies no longer their employees can choose from a large flock of candidates.
But they must praise and particularly for highly skilled workers balzen.
Mainly graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October about 40,000 engineers are vacant.
And the so-called engineer gap will get even bigger according to VDI-forecasts.
For the auditing and consultancy firm KPMG is novel Dykta on the talent hunt.
He organized elaborate Recruiting-events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern, with trails the participants using GPS coordinates must find their way.
Eight promising students to send the company next year across the United States.
Incidentally, can look at the participants KPMG-branches and the company.
Who should decide in two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicant flies in the US.
The slashing and burning the high potential in the universities, the artillery according to Dykta widening.
"We want to deal with the Race for the mass."
"Just a simple Segeltörn was not enough for us."
For talent hunters Dykta the bill seems to be working.
"We have until now with all participants a similar action last year contact."
"Some are nearing completion and want to compete with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhlen on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also campaigned for professional measure on the Pirsch.
"We try to reach graduates at a technical measure."
"Some of the Inter-solar," reported Sitha Stübe, personnel head for solar technology manufacturers Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs about 1,500 staff in Germany.
Stübe knows of the offspring.
There are currently 35 posts advertised on the company website.
"It is just very hard to fill vacant positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money", she says.
Another way is contact on the Uni-professors.
Solarworld is cooperating with various universities, the University in Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that we work placements or write his thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not planned with the solar specialist.
For trying to promote other benefits for the company: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can often do not offer a large corporation," says personnel head Stübe.
Money does not play the leading role in the job hunting any more.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are crucial factors.
Solarworld documented in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute makes an annual list of the best German employers.
Asked how satisfied they are with their work and their Jobumfeld and look to the framework conditions for the workers.
Staff from the head Stübe hopes placement also plus points in the Jobsuchenden.
"I think that applicants look especially after external assessments about a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer branding academy advises companies want to build a reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make it attractive to an employer, on their own staff," he says.
In the industry jargon that internal Employer branding, employers brand education within its own workforce.
"Content employees are the best ambassadors."
If one treats his people well and they identify with the company, they would automatically to friends and acquaintances to advertise their employers.
"This is like a game with gang", says Kriegler.
Obama stops new drilling
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years there will be no new drilling.
A similar ban, the government issued in Washington - and that their previous plans once and for all.
Also New drilling off the Atlantic coast remain banned for now.
This informed Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, at least for the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident that claimed the lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had pressure from the opposition and the industry his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US of oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is still not been resolved.
In the center of the criticism the British energy group BP, is faced with billions demands.
An investigation commissioned by Obama in the course of 2008 to submit their results.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
In the end have had several oil companies immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben.
With tighter controls and stricter safety rules want Obama and Salazar a fresh disaster.
At present, the competent authority, which was in disrepute, radically reformed after numerous corruption charges.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne.
The industry warns now publicly that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be significantly lower than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultant BDO - before the Bohrverbot by Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complained the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change with the regulation exactly."
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the river is ölbraun, it looks like at the station: billion litres of oil crude oil have destroyed the nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari mean well.
"You not haunts", reassured the eco-activist journalists:" You will still have enough oily sludge from the lens. "
The 37-year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, a leading up to the chest in water watenden boys with the surrounding Schlieren abzulichten: In the regenbogenfarbenen water the scene almost nicely.
That Under the surface brown Rohölschwaden, is not to see.
Have they buckets of shrimp, told Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Now is the lazy river waters completely dead.
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen high-radioactivity tons of crude oil in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now six hours row to fish containing waters, in the heart of the Niger Delta Ogoniland is one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the Flussläufen criss-crossed Mangrovensümpfe is apparent the full extent of the devastation.
Instead of helles water wühlt the motor boat brown brew, who in his hand into the water, ölige finger.
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black Lakritzstangen from the soil, sad I occasionally present palms their Wedel depend.
As otherwise they are usual in wetlands one searches in vain: As soon as the says, is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger for the health."
The war comparison is apt.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield disputed for decades: Here, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe here in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa later executed the first organised resistance here the Shell had to stop his production company in 1993 because it was dangerous for its oil workers.
Today the company denied the return to Ogoniland, while across the delta region of the three size of Switzerland with about 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped more than two million barrels a day of the black gold fields in Ogoniland, the situation is too unstable to the company.
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich mentioned.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded.
Always breche such a Bohrkopf, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres of after experts estimate in 50 years into the ecosystem of the delta arrived: Year after year the amount of oil, as the wreck of the super-tanker Exxon Valdez '"21 years into the sea off Alaska became one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the continuous eco-meltdown, it is argued.
While the Shell company sabotage and organised Öldiebstahl blames for more than 90% of the pollution, environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner, the group's 2008: The rate of defects in the pipes were "considerably higher than elsewhere".
In one place, which from a distance looks like a deserted, oil-smeared workshop in the open emerge from the mangroves figures: You are stark-naked and up to our necks ölverschmiert.
Under one of the many barrels, partly with tubes, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify future has come a fire: An illegal small refinery.
In the barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours fervid, says Michael, the head of the group.
First seen petrol through the pipes in the Auffangtopf later spits at the end of the pipeline, kerosene and diesel.
So produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels of diesel à 300 liters: "It brings us 34.000 Naira a" - around 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only a single refinery.
Ridiculously low with just 40 euro cents per litre diesel price can undercut the illegal Kocher even their raw materials, because they get it for free.
It comes from "Bunkerern" the pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: Go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisionally between raw material is stored illegally veredelt: The lion's share of fill organised criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military tankers and in command on the world market.
The debate is whether the environmental disaster to the activities of the population or the lax production of activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"The oil companies would not be perceived as intruders and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni especially Shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group in question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese stand out as better."
As Michael nervous.
"High time that it disappears," says the muskulöse put.
"The soldiers can come Every minute."
The illegal Ölveredler of the special forces are caught, they are not arrest, but a painful bribes.
The mainly hail from the north - as all Nigerians - soldiers want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover hazardous construction defects in A380-engines
The A380 is obviously a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered a notgelandeten machine a possible construction defects in the investigation, which could lead to a "catastrophic failure".
The airline Qantas now want to sue the engine manufacturers.
The passengers of the notgelandeten Qantas-Airbus had appears to be much more luck than at the beginning of November has known: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority in their investigation a major safety problem with the engines of the A380 aircraft - and now warns against a possible construction defects.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in a Ölschlauchverbindung he could produce, it said in a statement published on this Thursday, the authority ATSB.
This could lead to "a catastrophic failure".
Have been affected by Rolls-Royce engines produced in 20 airplanes of the A380-series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, on 4 November notlanden in Singapore.
The Australian airline is taking legal action against the British turbine manufacturers.
They submitted a statement to the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, the him further legal actions against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said that his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire engine had solved sections and damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must now be changed up to 40 engines worldwide.
The Australian researchers announced that further safety tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected train stations.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue was deemed sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency evacuation of the Qantas-Maschine, the airline had its A380 fleet for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines has about three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa changed in an A380 as a precaution, the train.
The doppelstöckige flyer is the largest passenger aircraft of the world.
National snowfall solves transport chaos from
Germany completely in White: Overnight Snow has fallen throughout the country.

Thousands of dead mate

Yet the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation is precarious Unglücksschacht further.
Just two weeks ago it was in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth come to a violent explosion.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62 years were killed.
A probe has been left in the Unglücksschacht down, but there were no sign of survivors.
The high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions for security reasons, no rescue workers down.
After the second violent explosion were the authorities and experts assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies have not been recovered.
Now family and friends with a commemoration reminiscent of the deaths.
Ten thousand people had gathered at a radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South island.
They were silent for Two minutes.
In honor of the verschütteten miners were 29 tables, where helmets, lamps and the names of the sidekick.
Also pictures and personal belongings, including clothing and Surfbretter, found their place here.
The government buildings of the country flying the flag on flying.

To hell, warriors!
Splatter fits the art cinema?
The director Nicolas winding Refn testing with his fighters-epic "Walhalla Rising".
In what may the Danish director Nicolas winding Refn have thought, when he has turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman powers his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like thuggish killing methods and his enemies at the Gedärme from the living body, if he has bad mood.
On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is called, the whole film about a word, and the other characters can at most times to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouting.
Otherwise, silence and the gruselig beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland geschwelgt, the Vikings world of about a thousand years ago the scene.
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest to Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys.
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with something more humour to the mainstream or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible.
Most art cinema-friends are around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen deterred.
The Action-fans will die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in depression and fog before the team arrives in America and there is silent.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has found no cinema-lending in Germany and now only on DVD.
This is particularly the magnificent pictures a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film a fever dream.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn takes him barely a moment of détente and drawn him with his icy images and the dark drift-like sound track very slowly cut the throats, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters.
Only a small blonder boy, faithful to the Einauge retains as something as innocence, all others are driven by anger.
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point warriors from hell, perhaps the Ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is an unexplained film you hate and admire, the angry, upset and astonishment.
An experience.
Mysterious Erdarbeiten
The Atomic Energy authority IAEA has new evidence of a clandestine nuclear program in Syria.
But the country refuses to comment, nor is it controls.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next bigger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley by the electricity.
According to a briefing of the US foreign secret service by the end of April 2008 would also under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar normal have been well suited to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties.
The CIA ran a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
By Computeranimation ignored it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, a verkleinerte copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
Moreover, it presented photographs that show the buildings from near or even the interior space.
The reactor is just before the operation, it said, but not yet with pellets peppers.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery with time rather bigger.
The Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was fairly certain that Syria in el-Kibar built a reactor, but hardly saw evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA presentation for "plausible".
You lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how confident he was to have a reactor, said a senior UN diplomat in summer just flat, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions".
The ruins of the alleged "unused military building" in the Syrians are urgently and planierten thoroughly.
However, an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which has been produced by people.
Moreover, the IAEA about a member State satellite pictures of commercial providers in the period immediately after the attack, which might be more powerful than the CIA.
However, these recordings on the market, because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive.
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to have operated a secret nuclear programme or to have built a reactor.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the IAEA to analyse the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite images.
Inspectors also denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of bombed-out building.
But Israel says pugnaciously.
"We will never comment on," said recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
So the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna gives - after all, is a grave violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about which the IAEA watchdog.
As a key to progress in the investigation to the IAEA apparently sees three more bodies, "functional link" with the alleged reactor And this still exist.
The inspectors have not disclosed what plants are, or what they are or what they seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are in the IAEA internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on a complex in Masyaf, in which it is most probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is probably in or directly next to a military base - just with this justification refused Syria IAEA access to the three locations.
It is said In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US secret services on the institutions closely.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three locations and the Euphrates Quader material was moved back and forth.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production".
But there were "no indications of sensitive activities", uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor will be operated with uranium, not enriched.
But where the uranium could have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these central issues there are plausible conjecture.
It is also unclear whether other debris that could bring valuable traces were stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truck loads of disappeared, nobody wants information about where the debris.
Only a few kilometers from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni Syria 1998 to investigate its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
Footage from the orbiting point, however, that Syria to the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA had demanded access.
This can be coincidence, but has hardly helped dispel the suspicion.
It is also stated In diplomatic circles, have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, it should allow Syria to keep possible military secrets alone shows how much interest the inspectors is the effort.
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal too.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna even a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no high urgency, approximately US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months so-called special inspections into the game, one of the toughest means the Vienna nuclear authority to control.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been "an option, for which I am open in the future" he hesitates.
It is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs a majority in the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are keen for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat recalled: "What if they end up nothing?
Dear in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on her still nameless Regiedebüt begun, there is anger.
The script has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We know a lot more about it - but that is enough for unrest.
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the war in Yugoslavia their Serbian rapists.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some in Sarajevo planned Drehtage short term were transferred to Hungary.
The film is marginalised in Hungary and is now in the post-production, but it will still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has reported, Jolie is itself an ambassador of the UN Refugee Relief.
Diplomatically, it is not - it has the women, weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which offered but rejected.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not, and Jolie attitude towards the victims betraying her enough on the script.
According to the UN refugee agency has recommended that Jolie as ambassador, told the Guardian.
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, the their script to read, has given a Drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie very is still not occurred.
The young author even claimed that they had no political intentions with her film, with great effort in the Yugoslav conflict has wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved.
The content, however, remains vague.
As a second Synopsis circulating on the film in the network, but rather different sounds: The lovers knew there was a war to break and, when a Bosnian Muslim, abducted in a Serbian Camp, where he works as a guard.
What sounds is significantly different than the variant "rape victims verknallt in torturer".
That Jolie film really starts before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation".
Now, it is only the hackers of Hollywood: Peace gain by the script, like so many before, illegally into the net.
Nothing like away here
On this evening is once again right around for the Irish.
No trace of grief.
For the home team dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans johlen with joy in krachend loud music, they scratch with the feet.
The Bailey-pub in south Cork, Ireland, because the players table tennis balls on a three metre distance in beer mug, and meetings.
"Beer pong" refers to the bizarre spectacle to win there is EUR 500 victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill Trinkspiel and restrained IT professionals, not really fits together.
And the 26-year-old tried to divert amusement, the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not fun in Las Vegas, he will lead Bewerbungsgespräche in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mulmiges feeling about this," he says.
"It is so far away from home and I have no work there."
After all: his girlfriend waiting in Auckland of him, "she had ruck, flash their Wunschjob as Eventmanagerin, may be a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home have been two of Tanners three Geschwistern their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the next period, say experts, the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they even with 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the predictions come true, there is a wave comparable with those that suffered from Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery for the Irish wealth, is now once again sadness.
The economic crisis, particularly the young, well-educated, Irish, for which it has only uphill.
Jobverlust and social decline during the boom years seemed absurd.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
But now three of ten women and men under 30 without work.
In the Irish Times, there are countless readers letters of young immigrants, the court: "Anything goes down the drain, in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, and our country will lose a whole generation."
"The last thing we do ask the light."
Law-student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student union, sees a bright future, because the government only window dressing and the young people no longer offer prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy, as new jobs are to be created", says the 20-year-old.
They watched as their counterparts from an unpaid internship next start.
Their main concern, she says, be it in four years to emigrate themselves.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Try men as Stephen McLarnon positive to occupy the issue.
McLarnon organised the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a mass on the subject of a general service to work abroad.
"For young people is the work abroad but a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career ladder," said the manager.
On its website show photographs surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Work abroad is not a Galeerendienst but also freedom and fun.
As it inspires elsewhere to build White Seán O Donovan for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Genselkirchen they just a fashion house.
In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His home is O Donovan now only rarely because he makes extra layers of the credit for his house at home abbezahlen.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as he after a long time, for the first time on the doorstep of his home.
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am as good as never again."
He laughs a little in embarrassment and goes through ausgekühlte rooms.
The little house is in a neighborhood with fine leafy front gardens, in the park Einfahrten huge, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan the House for four years ago for 380.000 euros - 100 per cent credit-financed.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions", he says.
He fears that it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan thought for a while, adding hot tea and says: "I have no children, which I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can begin anew."
The civil engineer speeches may not, but at the moment he often hears.
"No one should starve, our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"A while working abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel only when Irish."
He laughs and told of his father, who in the last major economic crisis to England.
"After seven years, he was back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner like this idea.
The future simply beg and see how it goes with the life elsewhere.
A few years working in London he is already behind in New Zealand and why should it not go well for him and his friend?
A thing is there But still, in these days it properly concerned: The celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"just Not too many emotions", he says and drinks a large drink of his beer.
"goodbye, that sounds scary."
"We call it a Weggehparty, very loosely, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a few games."
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results came the Latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusive was published in the Economist.
This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows that the change in this region.
Two facts in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye.
First the good mood in Latin America
And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democracy movement (see table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy every year since 2002, at around 6%, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy since the onset last year recovered, is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are what lowers the regional average (Diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice of the same as last year, 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
Some 34% trust the convention of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts to bring more democracy.
Also during the global economic crisis continued, perhaps that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery.
Moreover, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is again this year by 32%.)
But there is strong atmosphere differences (from country to country. Diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread Fortschrittsdenken.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount and violent crime have increased, this is less the case.
Only the second time since the poll began many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country, a bigger problem than in unemployment (5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. But declined the values and 38% last year, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and the market economy: Approximately 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 it was 56% (6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% for a private sector), though their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalised many private companies.
Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents (18% weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The people in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, however, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua.
An electoral defeat
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts exceeded the fears of poll workers who rushed to help the beleaguered country.
Overflowing ballot boxes, many votes cast, notes in Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were displaced by the earthquake in January off around in search of a choice.
Finally, Some completely gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged tops, because of alleged fraud demanded the lifting of the election results.
It came to sometimes violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as well in many contexts."
According to a cautious statement of observers of the organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, as seriously as they may be, the process is not necessarily unlawful".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, is obliged, will announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity proceedings.
If Célestin Jewish, with little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still living in tents, was a low turnout predictions.
On election day, many Haitians by poor organisation of the vote.
Shortly before election beginning approximately 250,000 cards which are needed on the election, were not distributed.
There is much at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
In the middle of Secret
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
Whether this helps her to a re-election next year, it depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, his wife economic policy, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation does not fully into account.
This allowed the couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit.
On paper, the Fernández-government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further disagreements.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (which a member of another in the face, and others accused the government of corruption), the Congress, the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss," the President.
The 2010 budget now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is hot: Probably it will increase this year by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - up to almost 30%.
Kirchner took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crisis, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not reduce inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte.
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now?
It has business and union leaders for talks.
And According to official statements should be limited to 18% next year.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in the year 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández Argentine financial economically back to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with shareholders, the former rescheduling of the country in 2001.
Now it seems Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as happens elsewhere, always rejected.
But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou known that the funds in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this were the first step to clear up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of Kirchnerismus.
If the Argentinians in March from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie she was shown abgeebbt.
If they would like to win another election, she must decide whether they many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer link to the mainland.
What does Taiwan by its big brother across the Straits?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, to elect mayors and city councils in the five city districts. this is a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building a cutting-edge business relations, einschl. of a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party, three of the five mayors, it received a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, the percentage of his party about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in town councils.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as truck convoys with Krawallmachern, flag-shift end mass parades and only scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held a speech at a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot in his face from the crowd. LIEN was wounded and a umstehender spectators were killed.
Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai mine-whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, what the KMT has brought more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably the ties with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates discussed on plans to housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For This reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time the DPP avoided, the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma in turn would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue his strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community.
China sent a negotiator to Taipei, immediately prepare for a summit to investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important things first.
It is thus prefer to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has since reinvented.
Two years ago it was strongly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was strongly for the absolute independence.
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the employees and the youth.
Tsai took place as the presidential candidate of the DPP approval, such as Su Tseng-Chang Chen.
Their party is doing everything now to show that it is capable of building close ties to Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. however, this requires open-minded discussion.
Tsai stated publicly that their party is a "reliable alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He called the pragmatists Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's intervention does the DPP hard to choose their possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted their campaign without him.
The main reason for his unpopularity unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to the statement of a KMT spokesman he will alter his cabinet and the local institutions.
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted.
Most Taiwaneses consider the economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer esperanza Spalding was surprisingly in the category of newcomer of the year excellent
If you are at the request of a President auftritts, people will say it.

The Secret Societ wild Steampunk-musician Darcy James argue, in the category of large group deserved attention. He is therefore against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life Ablum "pathways" a good example of a Bassisten than democratic band leader.

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five hours of often heated public hearing the unanimous agreement of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre local rules and will be an aesthetic catch.
"The project is supported by many good people - of Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As Americans makes me proud."
"It shows that there is justice."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They are just very loud."
"In this valley are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the building of the centre went on until almost midnight, and the voices on both sides, according to the Press-Enterprise fairly evenly distributed.
The debate was on the website of newspaper further.
"There is no America more," a comment.
"It is another Planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community with around 135 families living for years peacefully in the Riverside County. but they wanted a larger and better places than the camp that they, together with a manufacturer for water filters plants.

With the approximately 17.500 m2 large land to Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents of the council can still appeal against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new forms of life on the planet or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign variety, among other things, of arsenic can live opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on the planet and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the hitherto considered vital elements is possible.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life is," said Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
So far six main elements were regarded as vital - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists figured out, there is a growing bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further if it phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life since scientists life and his forms must recognise, Anbar.
The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery Außerirdischen life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standard', which we believe are absolutely vital, not necessarily said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a first, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from Astrobiologischen NASA Institute, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsenic levels.
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, that microbes that both are exposed, perhaps they can replace an element from the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is behaving chemically similar as phosphorus."
"This the organisms find it hard to separate an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic different than phosphorus. it in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says Anbar.
The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It suited to and grew.
The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that they also can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can happen, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or Moon on the arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic But so far there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic happened in the early Erdjahren more, she says, the science is therefore assumed that early life forms have used it.
"There is reason to believe that life can also have developed different than in the early geological era", not a member of research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.
Rest of stolen exhibition dogs found in Comptons
The other two of the four exhibition dogs a Bellflower-Motel were stolen, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff Thursday.

Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace should take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, should the other dogs on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba Show in other competitions.
Southern California is a freeze on the nearly month-long tour of the pair of dogs show to dog show.
On Monday evening checkten Peek and Rickard in Motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their vans before their bedroom window.
They arrested three other dogs - a Boxer puppies, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - with their Motelzimmer.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis remained in the vans, because there are cooler.
They left the window a crack wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6: 00 p.m. as stolen.

On Thursday, was not yet clear whether a Finderlohn paid.
The lion brüllt again after judicial approval of the MGM-restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM now finally given the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge began on Thursday offiziel 'Gläuberplan, the debt of $5 billion in loans and the 86-year-old entertainment companies to pave the way for new films and TV shows.
According to the statements Thursday the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy laws, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more. Barber and Birnbaum are a slimmed-down studio as CEO.
The number of employees will be reduced to around 320 by over 400.
For MGM enters Chapter 11 only when JPMorgan Chase a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM-productions.
At the moment is leading a consortium of the investment bank, which brings in $75 million, the company. The funding to by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009 with the task of the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of companies with interest payments of $300 million per year, the solution to their financial problems.
In August, the manager Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became known.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the financial worries to solve MGMs and more than 140 Gläuber of the studios auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties at the end of 2009, the company decided to buy.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion requested by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything over again, as the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debate and internal disputes was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM officially has overcome bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper for their work a bonus of several million dollars.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million
Cooper, who was paid $375.000 monthly for the management of the company, received a $4 million "success bonus"
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio just a film and produced a year plan with seven or eight films in the cinemas should come at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needed a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for its financial contribution to these two movies, directed by Peter Jackson will result.
The investor Carl Icahn, of the approximately 18% of the MGM loan attempted a fusion of the studio with Lions gate entertainment, whose largest shareholder is.
But the final negotiations between the two companies led to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your present budget in balance

But you can protect your present budget.
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale club.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost less than last year.
And while fewer new toys with its own website, is the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries.
Here are a few suggestions.
(Unless otherwise indicated, all the prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as guinea pigs that sing a note on her stomach.
Even in a down note by mehrmaliges pushing can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Respect: If you with the pressing started, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of Gesand and dance is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children, 2) the best choice.
On the basis of last year developed Elmo Live technology offers the animatronische doll recantations as' Simon says' and, thanks to the new hinge feet with Radblockierung dominates the moon-Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Their parents complained about the lack of volume.
If you are a child of the eighties, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized Lernspielzeuge.
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a whole bunch of issue cards with which a car journey to a lesson can be, with a preached with Autokorrektur-Funktion as a teacher.
If you want to entrust your child Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard.

Finally, there is still Scrabble flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
At stake is the blocks words together, before the time. It is great for an improvised Buchstabierwettbewerb.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you are on offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For your child an online animal in Club Penguin, you can, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 'mix' n match figures package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.

Police operations in China get Soft
As a training officer Tang Shenbin on an urban place, revised his nervous subordinates and gave it with military authority and depressed voice commands.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and disdained for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - impress the viewers.
"Just!"
"Looking ahead!"
"Shows them", he whispered to them, "as beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, hardly the teenager age has outgrown, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers were closed.
Four pairs of black pumps were in gerader series.
Four proper hats were perfect on the blue-white gestreiften ribbons held hair.
"They see, on average," said Mr Tang remarks contemptuously.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province Guangdong instead of the grey Greens a leuchtend blue uniforms.
Wuhan in central China, violence by Dutch rigid: 2009 skittered on reportedly 50 officials a properly established Imbisswagen and gaze at the operator until this packed after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu district in Chengdu, a city with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally alter the image.
Since 2003, 13 women strengthen the urban police. They were special because of their appearance, their good character and her youth.
They should give a softer, femininen aspect to the crude police.
But unfortunately there would also be Scarlett Johan Karlsson hardly manage to improve the bad image that the Chinese have squads of this city.
With right, so the critics.
Unlike the police these officials should the urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008 in Hubei Province officials beat a bystander to death, as this them with his mobile phone while filming, as a protest against a dump.
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and posted on the Internet and described as criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials.
A violent video game strotzendes that can be downloaded from the Internet shows in China trained officials in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan frightens the government," lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate.
As the Distrik in October by advert eight female recruits, was an editorial in the Beijing Evening News, the question whether the women would have real tasks or just as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the vacancy notice of women aged 18 to 22 with good character and "harmonious face trains.
They should be, on average 1,5m or 5 feet 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with achieving the 26 year of life.
According to the officials the activity is physically too hard for women over 25.
"The most important is their image," was a unbenannter district officials with the quasi-governmental website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, features, etc."
Then temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan Is put," he said, and added, "but they also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city administration of the southern, would not like to agree with this description,
That was, however, in China size targets advertisements for both sex are not unusual.
The same is true for regular features.
Whether this is synonymous with good looks, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply.
"Here we can unfortunately not leading or use Buckligen," Mr Zheng.
"Their image would not be good."
Liu Yi, on the Baoguang Square near a monastery patroliert, 22, has Apfelbäckchen and a historic moment.
They empfindetes is not a sexist that so great value is placed on their appearance.
"You find, I see in this uniform sexy?" Asks them with ironischem look.
Her colleague with the Grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their regret the short position, because they have more ambitious career plans than simply dealers through the alleys to prosecute them on business.
Every morning deals, the some remarks with around 12 street traders who try to sell as many on foot or on bicycle rolls and Tofugerichte before they continue to be hunted.
"Mr Wang, disappear here."
"We have said this to you so often!" said Frl. Xu a dealer who fled on foot and was at a Fahrradkarre befestigten Nudelküche temporarily down.
According to the officials is the work rather monotonous as demanding.
"It is the same thing almost every day," says Huang Jing, 20, who studied in the leisure time.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials the goods of the dealers not, as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten to notify their superiors male offenders.
That should protect them from public hostility, officials in China often are exposed.
This year, rioted outside hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, after the rumor circulated, Chengguan officials would have a traffickers killed.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the incident at night, 14 government vehicles were undermined or set on fire.
Xindu remained free of such violent incidents.
But disturbances are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officials this morning patroulierten, about 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, contrary to the rules on the pavement was repaired in a workshop.
The owner shouted blue murder.
After 15 minütigem hesitation gave officials with cruel point the way to their cars and drove with the motorcycle and his owners.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, remained. In this capacity he white shield to remain anonymous.
As their fellow the coordinators - men over 40 - a supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," says Mr Li calmly.
"Most of the time, the people with the dispute."
Public Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Public Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to give her a lobbying against him, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
That decision ended the worst legislative success against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal, the nationwide headlines sparked a drubbing and his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was "delighted" about the decision after the year-long investigation.
The ethics committee of the Senate, however, could impose a Disziplarstrafe.
According to the Ensigns lawyers, the Justice Department informed that the investigation against Senator Ensign was stopped and that in this matter no more charges.
The Justice Department did not comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there was sufficient evidence that the lobbying Ensign prohibition.
Interviews, E-mails and other documents were made public for the first time in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents to lucrative contracts, in order to buy his silence over an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns worked as treasurer.
Ensign, contacted some political friends to Hampton work. According to the records and interrogation he assumed they attitudes Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team, it was he was not lobbying for a year for his former employer or the entire senate.
According to the statement of ethics experts the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, before the affair were chummy, against the so-called ban on the revolving door-Lobbykratie.
According to the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door-statutes, Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients in the sights of the government.
While the Justice Department formally rejected it, the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-case, said Mr. fire and other ethics attorneys, the ministry seem very careful in rather political charges after a lot of defeat by the media with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor to drop.
Prosecutors "are obviously said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign court.
"In principle, This means that a high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview he had received a telephone call of a public prosecutor and a further the following day, in which he was told that the Ministry will raise no complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns defender had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office, in a statement on Wednesday repeated in accordance with the law. "
Mr. Coggins declined to explain the legal arguments it had made with prosecutors.
"I am not well in the conversation details between me and the Ministry of Justice Only so much is said: We think to have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation because of a separate complaint by the group, after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensigns parents in from against the federal election law.
The Election Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, the one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign was.
An E-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has got as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, in which he told him that he had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, the Interior Ministry because of a "anklopfe."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and one other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the transport minister, a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton to lobby had stopped.
Last year, for the first time information about this affair to the public, Mr. Ensign to apologize to his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he had been in the ranking Republican in fourth place.
Many months After he was no longer struck two weeks ago, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he seek a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign may no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper, the senator hopes that the Ethics committee follows the example of the Justice Department and its investigations.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada", she said.
Cheshire-appeal calls attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
The minutes-stroke verschickten via Twitter their reports on grey cent testimonies.
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house that flare.
On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, the panel has ruled.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for an appeal and the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that it through intensive reporting on the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury was improperly influenced by the public indignation.
This protest Appelationsgerichte could lead to deal with the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the court.
"As I have seen it during this process, I think that it really is a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom influenced the individual right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court, rejected the applications by referendum succinctly last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But this was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court objections have noticed that the reporting of famous cases doubts about the fairness of the process.
In his historic decision in 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some think that the television series and the movie "On the flight" based on this crime.
Some lawyers say, court judgments, which Mr. Hayes condemnation half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary for the communication from the courtroom at the time of the fall Dr Sheppard were unimaginable.
"There is a good reason to be worried about the impact of the new media in processes that will be followed by a broader public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. according to his report,
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the process fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain to discuss years and thus delaying a condemnation.
The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes had already been explanation as judge Blue could not allow them to test the reaction of potential Juroren, giving them during the Jurorenauswahl.
Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision, the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment appeals they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media would have kindled the flames of the emotions on the case.
"Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote lawyers' has previously in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide has not yet seen. "
Their focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that this direct news is rabble-rousing but slower than the reports will be reimbursed, a technology hostile view is that the report on future processes verarme.
However, some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes need the Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion.
In their objection they related to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in the conviction of due to the coverage was lifted, and made clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, 'Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can combine courtesy that divides us?
After a campaign to Schimpfwörtern and negativity is little civility in Washington this week.
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly back to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues, while the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions to be taken.
After all, what we hear, it has not been a polite discussion between two sides an account of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party points.
The public meeting of the deficit of the President's on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences between the members to continue.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that separates them, the members.
This is hard enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation here.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while tried the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electorate,
So the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for rapid change the atmosphere in the past two years
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election Washington at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works.
"It is inevitable after elections.
Elections are partisan passions die.
And that is good. "
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts at the end of the year, and no one
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, either temporarily or permanently.
It is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that believing that favors tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the increased optimism that, in these issues during the "lame duck session" and also the new START treaty can ratify.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112. Congress in January.
Instead, he says, is a stage of the Nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that have to be done is done, this short-term psychology in turn confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - courtesy of genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty-voters who serve their education.
How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, they know that they must try to their promises to reduce government spending and healthcare reform.
This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly what a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, pushed the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and they are very close to this number.
The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, because in finance, at least, little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle next year in the form of party clashes, if the Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health care system, later followed by a period of major zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end as it happened in 1995, then both sides must carefully on the public reaction.
Who is always condemned to losing, will have to change tack and seek the compromise.
In fact, This may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization is greater now than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem to have a more ideological gulf between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time activists on both parties 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice to 2012.
So seen the politeness which is carried this week for the show will be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require very much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated.
Durchgesickertes U.S. document portrayed Moscow as a port of corruption
The Control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and the protection money which she to the Kremlin. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money so that they can hold their expensive standard of living in Moscow
They collect money not just of legitimate businesses, but also by organised criminal gangs.
Every shift of the bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as a "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the ladder to the top.
The memo, which under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that in the meantime would have been cleaned.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a construction company, have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption for years, and he has many defamation lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt, "it is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty."
Like A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, the surveys show.
But it is unusual that, as the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard that a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link of the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some them as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government as a government," the memo.
"Criminal elements Enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of the criminals / the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection) about the police, the state security service (FSB), the MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, as well as by the whole Moscow government bureaucracy.
Professionals have dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Least follow the ordinären criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city offers no help."
The report says that the FSB pockets of the largest companies and the money the police small business people arrested.
A source said, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not by organised crime), not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs no longer needed as before."
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is complete, the protection itself be very modest no; even the ones who pay are sometimes arrested.
That does not pay, find their business very quickly closed - because of one or other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times to combat corruption, but noted that he has made little progress.
The memo the message contains descriptions of men, with suitcases full of money, probably in the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of when, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of this tape."
"It is not a part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Giving, corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country is ranked 154 a recent study of the global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries the least corrupt to 'most corrupt ").
The disclosure of the memos of the American embassy, what happened after Moscow time late in the evening will arouse within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have called him Medvedev Batman and Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we did not expect that to happen with such arrogance, such pressure and unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a poorly lit, betonierten class room with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who built him in the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he has taken his people," said Sreng kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers", the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north west of Cambodia's popular, where he hospitals and bridges built infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge towards the government, are longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation Forum the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
For the first time In June, the government distributed a schoolbook, the children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments the fear under the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs hindered their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation, the regime.
"For them was the life under the Khmer Rouge is glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is splitting families."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 pole Pot-Ied government, fled the remnant of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
This widespread them until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary guerrilla war from its base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok consulted the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government began cross which led to the Kapitulationen Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who had not given in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain arrested.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial.
As their patrons, they are no longer protected fled most former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts because they laid down their arms, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have very little benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for justice and reconciliation, across Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional know."
Sor Lim, 55 years in 1974 as a teenager had joined the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before 1998, a life as poor rice farmers.
"The Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"TA Mok everyone has something to eat."
"But now the life is difficult, because we must look to ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raises concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The mission of the Court it is the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not said whether it will pursue further action beyond these four cases.
That has done little to the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation focused on In Chaem, 64 years during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district leader in the province Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007 she had $number Representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project, in which thousands of forced labour probably died.
On a hot night came In Chaem from the work in the fields her wooden house on a dirty streets outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun casts long shadows on the desiccated grass in Chaem rejected it, about their past the Khmer Rouge.
The court should they vorladen would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said.
"There would be no prosecutions more would be in war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would more suspects on trial, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk of documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-times means bring the broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that everything can understand."
The centre created the first schoolbook approved by the government about the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of Democratic Kampuchea".
It circulated the book in June in Anlong Veng appended to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia know young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students, an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejected many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school books and the court to gain influence, "he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge here has a powerful attraction.
Up In the Dangrek mountains leads a Sträuchern überwucherter and plastic waste verdreckter path to a rectangle over of black soot, covered with a rusty Blechdach.
Pol Pot's body was here after his death in 1998 on a pile of burning tyres.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a Handyverkäuferin roadside, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day, it wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will give a bush ripe bananas - in the hope that it will bring their luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect weapons-grade uranium.
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council.
The US government has for years tried to convince Belarus, not collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But officials of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been taken to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center.
The setting the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff because of the sensitivity of the subject, anonymous, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" in April, the White ruled Russia.
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to secure the next summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (2012)."
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the partnership Global security, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Byelorussian President Alexander Lukashenko has said that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which basically weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material...
We will not make any dirty bombs from this and we will not sell it to anybody. "
Belarus still approached a few months ago the United States, interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first Attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easily contaminated by radiation, say officials.
It was in a Spezialzug load, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money flowing in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely careful coordinated in order to build confidence," which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, the global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be under the joint agreement camps until 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"The progress of this global security issues heißend welcome the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens", she says.
No objections of the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as can be seen from a telegram of the Ambassador of US in Madrid.
The reflect the enhüllten Wikileaks and the daily newspaper El País "(by cable) documents. It is added that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega the Spanish Government should be informed," in order to show that foreign aeroplanes
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy leader admitted, the report by the Council of the have and confirmed, Spain have nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined Spain does not have any objections to the secret service flights on Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed", not "unprepared to be surprised," said Aguirre cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish Government "no great attention to this matter, although the government had little influence, as they have in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González was in January 2007, the message to understand that it represents the judicial initiative, the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Geheimdienstzentrale (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights to request would not block.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a meeting with the prosecutor.
However, the United States was on the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors' more concerned than about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments," lamented Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly hard on their independence and do what they feel is appropriate," he gave instructions to his staff, "bloated rhetorical comments to avoid the tension abate."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the way the PP in this matter.
"Despite the generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, an indication that the government Zapatero's actions of which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the government of the he emphasizes.

Partido Popular won four seats in Congress, and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a decisive role
After the major Stimmen- and growth in the last regional elections the PP looking at the parliamentary elections - or not preferred. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved in these elections, is usually twice as high as in elections in Catalonia.
So the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, during this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
Last Sunday the PPC 384.091 votes.
If these rising trend - the diversion of the voting shares of the PSC and the linking of the electorate, the PP - should encourage the PP, analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 congressmen could rise, while also CiU four (it now has 10) gains and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (by 25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people's Party the ERC would lose a Member - currently has three - while ICV keep their Members or gains.
If the choice calendar should be kept, however, the next date with the local elections falls in May 2011. Also, the people's party (PP) can be an end to domination of the socialist, and in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the city council Barcelona, one of the municipal authorities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the people's Party agree that the PSC cities Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which a majority still on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV back.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that the party will lose their representation in the local council emblematic in which they should reach 5% of the votes.
The PP recorded an increase in their vote share in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced to be able to play the principal role in Tarragonas change. There they Had before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP government.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign met several times.
In other important areas, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party a significant growth.
Currently, the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and wants the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis arrested of the policemen of the intelligence agency of the police of Barcelona and the Nigerian formed the jihadi cell, different Al-Qaeda groups, including among this the "movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and" Laschkar e-Taiba (let), the latter was the author of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister is a great importance to this research, which so far is that he insures, with the "operation Kampai" the falsification apparatus Al Qaidas world "weakened" and "so their ability to act."
The researchers estimated that in the two years in which the cell has been active in Catalonia, thousands of passports to Thailand, where these were sent forged and then sent to the groups, from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, up could exceed the limits of European and other Western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which was active in Europe. therefore, apart from the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units involved in the investigation. It is not inconceivable that in the area of the EU in the next few days as the last Tuesday in Barcelona has carried out.

The old nursing home confirmed that the deaths are not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the old house in Olot does not preclude their carers on eleven elderly killed
The leaders of the Altenpflegeheims La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, highlighted the damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurses in his work at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible - the establishment had caused.
The director of the elderly home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada in court and announced, "La Caritat would like to thank the responsible (for the deaths the process and the civil liability".
The establishment is not only a social prestige because they accept the criminal acts of the Pflegers not realised in time, but now also pay a the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime originates in August 2009 and that he had further killed since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing homes - because he suspected that no doctor has examined the deceased person, but the formalities were conducted by telephone due to their age and disease.
The head of La Caritat prominent writers have expressed this point flatly and declared that "lack of measures keinerzeit could have been the reason for the incidents
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there was "no evidence of negligent actions a person other than the accused in the
The already as "death angel" getaufte acknowledged the day before yesterday and said that the first 11 murders committed crimes on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady murdered.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he was a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the access of the staff to the medicine is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail of nurses in six of nine crimes committed in patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will be able to see whether Vila is lying and for his first victims in a less cruel death or whether he this ausbrannte from within, by giving them Bleichlauge verabreichte as it according to the confession with three women had done it between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat listens to the statements of the Pflegers no faith, not the number of murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements in court had made and that it makes sense to change its approach after eight successful murders
They say they did it for this reason and to clarify the scope of these events to the judiciary.
Posturing of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The Investors have responded strongly to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, warned that "markets should not underestimate our capacity for response."
The euro Peripheriländer risk premia increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB can deceive and the euro gained to points, which led to concern not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market collapses in the extent to which he recovered, but following the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not lose his fear.
A month ago the European Central Bank to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, whereby the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must backtrack.
The Bundesbank has called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. it is Only a einwöchiger permanent access will be maintained.
After the Ireland-crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access at quarter end to guarantee the liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the program to buy bonds and spend a stärkendes signal.
If the established expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets yesterday thrown back and if halstarrig insisted that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt into account and then the markets collapsed, could this story tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they, too, which they bought a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal rather weak.
The state asset management was only 500 million to 5,28% to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction.
Yet the interest rates in Portugal by 30 basis points across the curve and reflected a perception changes in the markets after the words Trichet's.
In Ireland, the numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly further 15 000. There is time until February, private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost all its credibility after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must obtain the parliamentary approval to his new budget next Tuesday. Because it still does not have the adequate support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has their discourse with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity needed to show that together we play the same score.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethoven's.
The Spanish Government yesterday emphasised the action plan on Friday is expected to be approved by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. sound like Vivaldis Four seasons in the ears of investors.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared with February was the response of the government and the Bank of Spanish quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bonds, which will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are a strong demand, which will remove all doubt about our ability to refinance.
For Spain the application of an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the existence, but also of the licence."
Only courage that we create.
The chairman of preaching fechtet at the request of his children the meeting of shareholders of Vega Sicilia in
The storm in open conflict of the family Álvarez, owners of the companies preaching and El Enebro, flaut.
David Álvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, the meeting of shareholders of El Enebro at the request of five of his seven children, because it considers "absolutely void". His children will try to get a majority of the administrative bodies of the company - winner of the wine while Bodegas Vega Sicilia - to control.

The founder of the largest Holdings for business services does not appear to be prepared, in his legal battle for control of the institutions of El Enebro.
He was expelled From the administrative Board of five of his seven children. This appointed to the shareholder meeting on 18 January this year, the trade register when challenged, to board members.
The meeting of shareholders of El Enebro by the judges of the trade Court number 2 from Madrid for the 16, has activated a new thunderclap in the lap of the family Álvarez.
The recourse to the judge for organising the assembly is the only legal way of convening the meeting of shareholders.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz by David Alvarez as a "desperate means of applicants - his five children - designed to legal wrangling, fraud and abuse the right annulled meeting on 18 January recognised," as official spokesperson.
This argument is the basis for the appeal against the Assembly to explain to them as "absolutely void".
The same protagonists in discrete silent, already unsuccessfully tried in June to richterlichem way to convene a meeting.
In El Enebro - assets society and holders of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - control David Álvarez 'seven children 100 percent of the capital.
However, the founder of the Services group, according to family protocols to use on 51% of the capital.
This is the real background to which the judge in the hearing on treatment of the challenge, for which no date has yet been set, has to decide.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since 2004 Red Bull in the world of the Formula 1, her story in this exquisite universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, nobody gave the newcomer attention and, despite its sharply rising background over the last few seasons in the final last November, all to the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilots and champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault to belittle want is the "secret weapon" that the multi-Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and created a winning team, have become legend.
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company in 2007 for purposes which do not have to do with motor racing the market.
This was dubbed PLM computer programme for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used.
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
PLM has made the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and the tests, design and implement.
Russwurm contends that in 1992 from the maximum average 10 technicians worked in a season three or four could introduce improvements.
In Red Bulls team are now 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer systems, they cause analyses and all possible changes to the cars.
The Siemens managers said the PLM software is all the components of the Rennwagen of Red Bull to analyze and improve, with the exception of the engine, the only responsible for Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the Simulators into reality.
The only limit this madness technical perfect is set to spend $40 million, a formula 1 team for his races in a season.
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a remote place built 50 kilometres from London.
It is two buildings in which visits - particularly of journalists are severely limited.
Everything that is happening is, Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including two pilots, the world champion Vettel and marks Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources, which the Energy-Drink manufacturer in the service of his participation on the tracks, there are other players whose support priceless and whose fame is zero.
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey, emphasised that five years ago, we could say that the progress made in the field of F for cars with 50 per cent for the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. The technology is 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 per cent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators'.

Sabadell wants his rivals in three years, a million customers' steal '
The executive board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war.
However, he sees a collapse in interest rate spreads, the banks are trying to offset with increases of the fees and the price for loans.
Sabadell expected in three years million private customers - a consensus still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB to take market share, but also a million private customers - 700 000 if the customers, the bank will lose - This is the great challenge facing this Bank, because until now it has their business customers more attention than their private clients.
This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 businesses.
Its market share in retail is 3.5 per cent, while the business customers more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the rise of the productivity, austerity, reducing costs. The challenges facing the bank so that together with annual report.
Only a few banks dare to publish targets and in these difficult times, since the financial crisis around the world, all the plans of the
Sabadell will complete its master plan Optima set four years ago this year. This was initially interpreted to three years, but due to the market situation he was extended for a year.
The Customers who leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola stressed 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a longer range."
The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years' work crucial to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest margins punished - will abate, will the risk premia, the banks and building societies must pay for their emissions to the preservation of liquidity to compensate for declining profit margins are already on the price of loans.
"The issues liquidity and funding are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We have not tap off the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola said.
BANESTO on Thursday said the order of their Filialnetz from the long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz on 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks have now Stategie, "to increase the fees within a competitive framework".
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group does not exclude, as always, corporate transactions.
Not for nothing he assured that in Spain 'greater companies are necessary. "
"In the coming year will change everything," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital "huge increase" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions in red numbers are falling.
He is of the opinion that the FROB in Kaptitalaufstockungen replace the money market.
After he assured that Sabadell also could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing can be in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, you could get short-term funding on Repogeschäfte and intercept the crisis.
CECA includes a second wave of merger savings from
The president of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that it could come to a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
As the concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks in the first phase. They retained the second round.
On the other hand, assured the president of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I think that the majority of the merger is completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica can not be considered as a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The biggest part is completed. It can be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all important processes are already complete. They were of Banco de España, all transactions has strongly supported."
In a group of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) led Olavarrieta, that the concentration process "as quickly as possible and that we have must be satisfied with the timely earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España
"The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28 000 million of assets at 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now very much greater, so we have fulfilled the Basel agreement", he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "there are a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, because "Banco de España exhorted us, within the deadline before the end of the year."
The president of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday, that Spain of one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and "perhaps" around the world, and added that those who anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noticed that we do not have to in the current economic climate "no concerns" about the state of the financial institutions and the savings concentration process a "very significant" have gone through, "as soon as possible".
He also reminded that the Spanish bank stress tests, the ECB in July, have been very good.
Zapatero and the red line Germany
Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on the markets have triggered a double response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed up to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government Minister Felipe González the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis presents.
How are these transactions to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future to maintain ancient traditions of a large part of his partner.
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area.
The Second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it is more science fiction sounds, supported by a large part of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population.
The Third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: More macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; Punishment of the countries, crossing the requirements; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time. So there are no excuses now.
First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German Government constitutional reform in order to prevent it from 2016.
It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign the Central European country when Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece painful,.
Then it was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political agreement in Germany, the public and the published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, to a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as Ireland crisis and everything is as follows.
But her proposal, if a little sweetened, was approved in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed.
It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, as of that date will no longer be the old ways of the euro.
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries to ban be severely punished, be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must take on a part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not understand it.
It is not just about the deficit to 3% by the year 2013 runterzufahren.
The demands are much tougher.
Under these conditions, And the worst thing we could do is to cheat.
I hope that the current turbulence in more rest.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by early 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, in order to make their way.
But Germany-red line is there, and it is not that something would change.
Among the possibilities is that we are the countries with little serious full gestopften euro area, not to be excluded.
In this case, we still say it could have warned us.
Sports and rule bypass
Tricks as Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will of a sanctions.
The alleged two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the champions League led to much ink has been spilled about whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before game end (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid his group, the two players the prescribed sanction the next league game against the Auxerre and without maps in the next game phase.
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with various sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but followed in this event.
Part of the debate that have arisen outlined the case goes back to that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which in his anthem blocked and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played in the drama by Mourinho, an episode to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behavior contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but its meaning.
The damage caused to the sporting spirit should be examined.
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offending players an unjustified benefited from the team. that has not been done.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypass understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the sanction happily.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still benefits for the feigned game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without tickets, their participation in a future game could begin.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain point uncertain advantage, because the team eventually leave. In addition, the players with this approach a penalty and in the second Kartenzyklus because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, also strategic decisions at a maximum benefit from the rules.
In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalties (that would be a clear case of Regelumgehung), they wanted more choose when they undergo this.
They took a strategic decision without a sentence or to flee before her.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and rule surroundings is blurred, I think that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen because of two factors: Because it was two exclusions and because of the way the provoked Regelübertragung.
The damage done to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive for the hunting for customers for groups Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar, this year an avalanche of
The employees themselves paid celebrations are spreading. They do not want to spend no more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there are groups in the run-up to Christmas dinner at the hotel and Freizeitgewerbe was taken oxygen. but as a result of the economic crisis solve a price offensive to the customer segment, which is the great mass, capture: Almost all want to between 20 and 30 euros for a Mittag- or dinner, confirm the these businessmen and associations.
The accounting is a bit more complicated, the calendar (Sylvester falls on a Friday) all orders dropped in the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of bookings of 16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times, many companies stopped the group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To not have to abstain from this tradition, many workers pay these from their own pockets.
As the economy still has the lowest prices, the chairman of the restaurants body of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organisation is not to predict how the holidays this month.
"People think it dozens of times, before they reserve."
"They would like, but they respect heavily on prices," he stressed.
The business will go well, "the quality at good prices, with a good service," he adds, and calls to remind us that the customers save in times of crisis, why prices of around EUR 25 most demand.
In a survey in various central restaurants turns out that the evening of 17 2008 providers leads to the collapse.
The group Soteras says the demand for this Friday, with the intention of less than 30 would spend EUR boom. The group has its Menüs with complete offered between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, the 16 restaurants in the town (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has the peculiarity of the calendar early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible last year's prices with Menüs for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euro," he says.
In Alleanza Nazionale Grup, El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 local guides, you lose the optimism not once since the second quarter of the revenue are good, even if few days focused prospects for the Christmas season.
Sources of the group also point out that the 18 a company on active day with friends, the Christmas will be.
The six Gruppenmenüs was a Christmas menu for EUR 30 or more than Preishit added. One has the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 per cent more than last year, and in return for more details, such as cava.
In some companies see green shoots grow again why the employees will be invited. This gives the impression that the groups eat is back on the upswing.
The umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with mergers as the pub, equally and leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-chairman, Enric Gomà to the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservations are "lively" although the customers' a maximum ".
The fun at the celebration is not, however, declined, regardless of who pays.

These risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumable spreading of the nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material.
The large number of people in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes are implied, will not only by the United States, but also of Russia as a ausufernd and reason caution.
"Pakistan must strictly gläubiges personnel to guard nuclear plants employ; because of the low educational and cultural standards have extremist organisations more opportunities, the participate in nuclear or missile programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the Julian Assanges website revealed documentation is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in the Pakistan nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that the communication with Pakistan describes as "frustrating ":" often there is no transparency; on offers of aid we no answers or they are rejected. "
Another confirms Peter Lavoy, officials of the state secret service for South Asia that, despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country
The Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit of top army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, the "clear" that "Pakistan's army its tacit support to terrorist groups."
In the race for Wikileaks head
Obama appoints a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol has a red warning to monitor and detect Assange.
Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which facts just difficult to explain.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "finding and following" of Assange from.
However, this is not a traditional layout on the arrest.
Furthermore, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden.
The lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they could contact with Mr Assange."
At 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities.
That is the way things. The 188 Interpol countries are Assange has to identify and, presumably, "provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries according to the organization's red warning as a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange
The action indignant Assanges attorneys, the gesten published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, the with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the approval.
"It is a hunting, not as a legal persecution", is accused in the letter.
While the world is searching him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange at an unknown location, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified location for an interview. During the conversation, he called for the resignation of the permanent secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and international agreement signed by the United States, they should resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, the prevention of new documents revelations.
The attempt of the spokesman of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views that conservative politicians and commentators these days.
The state department has asked the congressional representative Peter King who will lead the chairmanship in the House of the to study the possibility Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to seize their money and those supports or to make a contribution to follow."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian president Stephen Harper, has gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement, Assange "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use a not manned airplane or something like that."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever It was always the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything that is no execution is eiine to mild punishment is", he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret ballot on his continuation in office.
Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary session principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time an internal rebellion in the ranks of the after the loss of 11 Members and half of the rows
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation the close to the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the impact of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor, and he will not bring the same headaches as other former currents.
Therefore the leader of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics to win, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning kündete yesterday that more than 200 regional council members of ERC on his secret could stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a parking ticket, they could do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of both the impression of division and subjection to avoid his person.
In several interviews he confirmed he would deal with the half of the votes plus a not feel confirmed, and he added without giving values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod close to demand the president is more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós the supreme body of controlled congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to speeding up of resignations, they will be the chairman of an action plan from now until May.
For this they expect that in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership on 18 will submit to the vote in the Council to be able to participate.
Their intention is to underwrite Puigcercós. In return, this promise, the Congress in the fall of 2011, what the party is already a fact.
The chairman of the ERC believes the "Polyphonie" damages the stability and he strives once and for all, the organisation in washing their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, which the President-in-Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog, symptomatic.
Given the Puigcercós is an ideologue, kept the holders of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives" will be based.
He was one of five to two.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of the party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet Suggests ERC should the General Assembly principle as a functioning finally abandon.
He verfechtet a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to hold the meetings with elected delegates.
By the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team that already in the last two conferences fought obsessively.
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of the party leadership with the review of the 2008 General Assembly principle at a convention on which should deal with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still out, because infogle internal Aufruhe of recent years, addressing this issue was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors are on the lookout, the time has come to this issue once and for all.

Obama is Twitter for the law in favour undokumentierter students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," twitterte the President of the United States in the popular social network.
The President Barack Obama supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - law to legalise undokumentierter students with a news on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," twitterte Obama.
His brief communication contains a cyber link to a larger document that calls on the public to contact their senators, unterzüglich with, since the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice, to which we wait, the time has come to listen to you," he said.
The news was widespread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all vote for every law, except for the extension of the tax rebate from the time of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could the vote of the Dream Act, legislation and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trust that, once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be established.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We All agree that the tax issue must be completed before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can reach an agreement at any time and then we can plan the ending of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, kündete on Tuesday, "he would vote at the end of the debate", so that the Dream Act - law legalisation initiative undokumentierter students from next Thursday in the Senate could vote, although the next week was more likely.
The version of the dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would approximately 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were 16 years old, have lived in this country during the last five years and a higher education or in the army.
The defenders of the law need 60 votes for the adoption of the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the time The organisations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive clout in the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, the Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats should vote to turn our backs on the initiative.
Among the most umworbenen Republicans from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the Senator George Lemieux from Florida, the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez took over.
Other Republicans in the past, backed the Dream Act, Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said that it on another occasion not more.
Another Republican who had voted for the bill, John McCain, his position has not yet been set.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate before the biggest obstacles.
The finger on the wound With literature
The second round of 'the enthusiasm for language' was a walk, in which the participants to narrative
"With the sex in the language I do understand, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" Asked the author Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua 'should open a cycle, the spanischsprachige literature used her question (and on this occasion celebrated the subtitles on another event was devoted to the round table the sex in the language, she said).
The finger in the wound... takes us in difficulties, "spuckte Argentine Schriftstellein sweet the audience that made mainly from young people at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) met this by Marisol Shultz moderierten round table where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero attended.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz later as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in the first person and is the champion, the search is to know what a "wound" and from doctor to doctor, it is no answer, but references to guide the narrative.
She leaves the Infektologen convincedly: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, is in the middle of the respiratory raubte, and declared that wound is not a scientific term, enthült psychoactive analysts the mystery: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that "the wound only learned that this really will be open and does not exist". But it is convinced that the mood in the language and their traps mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez asked a entzückende story, which he called 'praise of the invention, and in the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous Zauberin the clouds covered, far gereiste men brought back or by a girl lost virtue restored. The story made a U-turn and reported of America, the great novel, not to his own Chronisten lacked from the outset, and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo, of the abundance of the Eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, all of us (the writer), spottete invited the false witnesses in the stories appeared, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, even the shame."
However, he stresses, "it is the crazy and liar, the best things imagine," and there are approaching reality and lie, where we no longer know what side the narrative, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He calls the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him what is told."
As Mayra Montero in the series, annotated and praised the writer of the diversity of interpretations, to which the invitation of the FIl the round table 'The finger in the wound had contributed.
The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin Least-developed their contribution of the great wound of the social force which affects their country - as all of Latin America - as a result of fighting the drugs trade.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs, a silent, not deliberately commitment," she said, after she had highlighted that literature communications and binding, between the writer and the reader as a "chemical reaction".
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "this finger of committed writer in the wound of the author," hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-moving world the intellectual habits and the control of the awareness to dogmatism, and forget that behind every confirmation a small no and that behind every denial a small yes. "
"Our thoughts and In reality, we have to moderate, and moderate often puts its finger on the wound and harassing those who are much more comfortable in the form of cartoons in black and white, prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also the powerful in black and white said he and invited to rediscover the sense of the letter.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endspielen back, and (he has experienced in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final are also two different styles, and their antagonisms of her set by their respective coaches meeting is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endspielen back, and (he has experienced in his career, but three times he had crucial games, and so far he has kept well why this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
The Argentine has with the medal for the second champion coverage, he is a step behind the winners and, amazingly, he has with the same team.
The santistische strategist, the first final as a coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', as del Morelia the reins, with which he learned a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' the crucial duel that he reached with 3-1 against Rayados lost.
Already With Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, had a setback some Rubén again, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes undecided, but at the time he came with 3-1 forward and received two ways to take the title, but ultimately failed three of his players the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. So he would not like to be pursued by the accident and the evil sorcerer, for the first time to celebrate a title, although he confirmed that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break any statistics, that is for a club, for my affection and so the title to me, but what happened before, is the most important, the tax man, when asked about the lost Endspiele.
The last final is still largely stayed with him, he assured, to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that to not act, we can celebrate the referee not the end, we are on the line, the players, because the last time we were with two Elfmetern already prepared to depart, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series could be decided by a penalty shoot not worried him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty would be in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared in the previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately, we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the intense desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us with something for this and we hope that this time it will not to happen."
It is in Romanso power, not only second to be champion and costing the glory, the title for the first time.

The new unit will take place no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new unity in the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, said that this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec should have started last January the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue.
The metropolis has since 1870 on a possible unity against corruption.
However, the announcement by Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
We have to say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils not in the slightest.
It was also not that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement public security gezaubertes rabbit out of the hat 'and' at a table at the end of their gebastelte solution "qualified.
Ministers Dutil had in turn sent to those who fear that too much influence on this political power, future unity.
"It will be the result if we see it will", he is contesting.
"We are aware of this problem."
Under Réjean parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public poll.
"The more M. Charest insisted on trying to prevent the creation of this Committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to be able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and politics systems to the ENA (staatl. The senior administration official training).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposes the Quebec of audit control a specific mandate, so that these on corruption and collusion appropriate investigations.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also takes the view that the Quebec of audit control the same power as Commissioners, which would allow her to oblige people to testify.
The formation of the unity is not the only project in the drawer of the government.
The Quebec Ottawa will also demand that the penal code to in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
These demand comes from the public prosecutor of the Operation Marteau, the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that jurisdiction in this kind of prosecution is unclear.

The Quebecer radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has a partial the Canadian supervisory board for broadcasting standards (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as for its ausfälligen way of talking about setback.
The CCNR believes, M. Dupont and CHOI 98,1 FM team had the right to their own opinion, however, certain statements "inaccurate information about the social welfare and however unjustified negative depictions of the Haitians and also contained the daytime broadcast programmes is not appropriate."

Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media effective argument, that a lot of reactions.
The Choi presenter had said, not in favour of Haiti-aid donations, because we do not know with certainty whether the people who need the money donations.

450 million in contracts without bidding
Hydro-Quebec in mutual agreement project planning firms 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydroelectric project East Main-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, made of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important part of the project management, to a total of $295 million has received.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance" überantworten was founded in 2004 as part of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector their responsibility, this important hydroelectric project a sum of $5 billion dollars, formed.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to companies consortia a serious ethical problem that the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase.
"This is a new way of conspiracy and refuted the competition."
"This means that rather than fix games instead of secret way now in open form," said carrying Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference.
In the Early morning Simard had raised the issue before the National assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the public's interest in this way can be used.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to it in the afternoon by they vehemently deny, that this contract would have been a stitch-up.
"I remain faithful to my line," she lashed out, confirmed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lack rigour".
She said it "was the least" that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is common practice.
It is usually a time of such temporary alliance that allowed two or more companies to combine their expertise on a requirement for a tender for a complex project.
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity regarding his work extent.
The construction is under way and is expected to be established to 2012.
However, was awarded the contract without competition, can take place; it had already given negotiations.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec with relatively simple projects no longer constitute an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir "noted last week, is in the field of Bauingenieur- and advisory professionals used model of the consortium of government investigations.
A short overflying the Quebecer companies register allows more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be consistent duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors, including Cima +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult together.
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person - Dessau.
What the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labour dynamic and hydro-Quebec this fact since the 1970s in a special way bill pays'.
Réal Laporte, the big employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement the nose on the fact that the Treaty on the project management after agreement was approved.
"If you make a tender and there are few candidate will your prices soar."
"You have two options: Either you do the people who see in this Mart and say: We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the persons".
The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were either the hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ East Main-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert approved for the project.
After reviewing the newspaper Le Devoir "more than 100 Ingenieurs- and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, including in particular resources laboratories conferred between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts to gerafft, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without their participation in "Énergie gérance counting".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
It is estimated the total to $449 783 344, including the Treaty with "Énergie gérance" about $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of "Parti
Minister Normandeau had suggested, the PQ is equally connected with the firms that they "funded", before they specify that it was its managers.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not heartening
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence was at the centre of sustainable growth, but neither to the rival brands or the eco-labels, which marked his election.
A pity, but in a media universe swimming, where information in favour of a responsible consumption teeming with: The barometer of responsible consumption has to mourn a lack of credible information, as the first reading showed yesterday.
Although they have promoted the use of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecer nevertheless appear to those who sell them, little credit.
Two-thirds of the Quebecer population, indeed the environmental commitment of the firms not to believe as the green companies advertising, so does the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated instrument.
Another fact: Half of the consumers is casting doubt on the credibility of the official, annexed to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands of the the barometer.
Along the same lines, the discourse of politicians on this subject of only 14.6% of the population of Quebecer seriously.
The information concerning responsible consumption appears, however, important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently approximately one third of the Quebecer consumers.
Emptiness and doubtful character of the information the zeal of 46% of the consumers.
This is after the higher price of the product, second part of the barometer identified brakes.
In addition, a third of the Quebecer of the performance of green products and services, which is trying to lay them suspicious about.
According to another communication has already had more than half of the consumers have changed their habits in 2010 and the brand of one or more products changed their conviction.
According to Eurobarometer, they had to 61% of purchases with dealers of their quarter and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and responsible - the index of environmentally friendly consumption had reached in 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumus of the Quebec loves to present himself as king of the recycling of trying to reduce its environmental footprints left by he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and environmental awareness seem nevertheless his car, so the barometer: Just 28% of the Quebecer indicated in 2010 using public transport or the Mitfahrzentrale prefers to their ecological interests.
Walking and cycling has also 39,1% of participants this comprehensive behavioral survey supported the stereotypes.
Bond for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government by the Société Angus and the parallèle called on companies to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developer society Angus and the company Parallèle, a donation of EUR seven million dollars from the Kultusministerium for the adoption of Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent had hoped that once its actual cineastischen function to entrust, do not seem to receive what they have demanded.
The government has accepted, in this case, however, on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation provides the Quebecer government instead a bond in less than initially hoped that a viable solution to create favourable conditions could, at least in the opinion of the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch, since the sums moderately downwards.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been approved by the president of the 'Société de Développement of entreprises culturelles "(SODEC), François Macerola, the
Several days ago, he had a recent technical report.
The counterproposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebecer owners Community cinemas and cinema complex against a direct state investment to support the takeover of eXcentris revolted had invoked by the argument, the Culture Ministers have no financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he sent to other cinemas.
Several other market participants of the segment heard but in contrast, substantial economic assistance.
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury.
The lack of cinema, the independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew his clientele.
The Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, in turn, is a privately funded Campagne, of which it is a sum of $700 000, in order to boost employment.
Since the spring 2009 continued only a single screen, to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle.
The Objective of the future buyers is the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "The hommes et des dieux 'to reopen.
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper Le Devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised down proposals keep them.
Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American diplomats pipes were spread by WikiLeaks, to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians opposite the Americans; they show but with the same blow the superiority of the latter open against Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot has not the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday publicly offer were spread more juicy details than mere substantial content, in which it has a very bad outcome.
One of 22 September 2008 carved link in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, reported about what the United Nations is no longer in their political leaders discussed operations.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the used in Ottawa, American ambassador.
Mr Wilkins offers various channels this situation.
"The Canadians almost packages inferiority complex, led the Canadian, political leaders, to talk about internal matters of everyday life, rather than the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore 'the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially too to speak about him ".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" since the two countries have close political and economic relations.
"He logically assessed," should the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the spirit. "
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa.
"Their trip will help support the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will be the basis of a recovery programme in the $30 to $40 billion is" Breese.
Nowhere, he had said that the government had to postpone parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the coalition would throw and the conditional continuation of opposition parties would impact on the quality of the proposed expansion programme.
Another, from January 2008 and affair on the part of the ambassador Wilkins drafted communication Washington agreed by the increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or contributions for the purposes of Muskelprotze CIA see of interrogation.
Yet another communication reported in detail about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe is ready to certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have the answer is yes, but on the basis of an individual decision.
Àm at the end of the meeting, described the Secretary of State, "he has a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin."
"The State Secretary promised to check the acts once again".
We are, after all, still say that the people heat up with regard to the web page WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely Stephen Harper adviser, had on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed".
He had to Mike Huckabee here from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of the light
The UN yesterday in Cancun a plan to regenerate the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) suggested that almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of the concrete major projects to implement in Cancun, the UN hopes to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
After yesterday's plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting on the Earth's CFCs be avoided if the white glowing pears, which has a monopoly of 50% to 70% on the market by fluoreszierende or, better still, by Leuchtdioden (led).
The lights are responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of global vehicle fleets.
In Copenhagen last year the big Abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, the global CFC emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt should.
This review should, however, still 5 is deducted from now until 2020 to stabilise the climate increases to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent this spiral out of control.
In the White glowing pears hole 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduces these energy needs two fold again.
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week - this society has taken part in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, a hint of the savings of the Auswechselungsplanes should be applied in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work also with a rheostat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, what is not always possible in the developing countries because they contain mercury and that it therefore as hazardous waste dump, which of an adoption agency.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit far more mercury to produce the white-hot pears wasted electricity.
In the United States alone that coal plants 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits which each country thanks to this international programme would generate.
Indonesia would such a billion dollars a year in buying electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2, which means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.

Affair Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "spy", the French public in breathing, left the diplomacy on red alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the close scrutiny of the diplomats of the United States.
The WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde - American documents give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée the Americans had stated his strategy, which went so far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid Kakavand, one in France and from the American justice because of trade with materials in the Iranian nuclear programme Iranian Gegeleistung.
Finally, they put the manner with which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to the to make credible, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A redigiertes in Paris on 12 August 2009 Diplomatentelegramm bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage."
François Richier, Elysée consultant strategy, in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d "Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her French method.
The advised the Americans, all keen to do their own nationals rückzuführen which would forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise", they said, 'the word "basic human rights", "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass respects the very sensitive to his image.
"all the more so since you ask, the Iranians not to do that."
Because "silence solves nothing", the debate over attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are "master in
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a "normal, Iranian tactics ":" Hostage taking for political blackmail ".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss (from prison, on 16 August, on the day that they are going in the French embassy) 'demand the payment of a large amount of money in the Iranians' (230,000 euro bail).
And he lets announce, the Elysée anticipates further taking of hostages, a phenomenon that will intensify.
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison in 12 days, will, however, continue to be detained in Iran.
An information was circulated: The Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States for illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics demand material to Iran, after ratification of a judge in Paris has been released from prison.
The American Embassy is, as with many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, that the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of this for the nuclear programme scheduled the release of Majid Khakavand bad news.
France has a horse-trading on board?
The release of the Iranian against the Frenchwoman?
At a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried it.
"It has a heated exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not change the judicial decision," he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remain under "strict" control of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a telephone number, again, then the American diplomat, the Iranians "is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran spares the Elysée not, through its efforts to make pronouncements and organised escape attempts "by the media believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an" important "and" influential mediator role ".
The Americans are watching this activity without irony and notice that the manipulation carries fruits, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram calls "the media the French authorities".
What is so much "thanks" towards Mr Assad, wonders the Paris embassy.
"Despite their statements Lobpreis secretly the French authorities, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document also deals with the reasons that have led to the Elysée this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "aimed at Sarkozy's policies of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed.
A 2008 launched policy was "by many critics in France and abroad was perceived as premature and undeserved."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria is trying to laud what can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
In addition, It is aim "to sow discord between Syria and Iran.
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have whatever".
"But we have thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss is back to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive it in the Elysée.
In a communiqué He thanks the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is a law, known as "the subject, which it will ban young people after midnight online Games to play, by giving them access, so suggested government responsible.
A draft law that the online gambling operator is to call upon young people under the age of 16 after midnight to deny access to these Games, will be presented to Parliament in December, representatives of Education and family ministries.
"Many children play these Games all night long and then difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft law betrauter Ministerialbeauftragter the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online Games are then again 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies would have a year long time to prepare for the application of the law, so he specified.
The government fasser as well, the manufacturer, to ask for access to these games every day time limit given to those young people whose parents ask, added the person responsible.
He will also those people who want it, free programs available that make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly by various events, associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online Game-competitions.
In November, South Korea 58 other nations four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the Ausrichterland
In a state of excitement because of suspicions of corruption will appoint the Executive Committee on Thursday the Ausrichterländer World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the rangeln for influence and the lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain: The 2018 edition of the royal discipline of the FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Niederlande-Belgium).
The edition 2022 will be something exotic; the International Football Association hopes, the first on the continent of Africa in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its subsidiary in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of people who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) the level of economic and political use of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are so until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise a hierarchy of candidates.
After the evaluation report of FIFA, offer the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) Act bessseren arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the election to be not so important.
The Sunday Times, with the finding of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the start of the revelations was that could just as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, the only once the World Cup was allowed to 1966.
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday fuelled by their own broadcast, the three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under attack takes.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to embarrass the English responsible primarily with David Cameron in these last weeks had an intensive lobbying.
The head of the government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train in 2005 for London, the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
Would this intensive use suffice to increase the value of the image of England before the Kommitee again?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spanien-Portugal does not lack assets with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal to the chances of Russia, which despite its shortfalls in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become increasing.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided that the treaty candidly suggestion on the Bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparations for the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder.
"We bewirft it with dirt, trying to embarrass them," raged Putin.
For 2022, the United States appear to be strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which is a very good project.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries which had helped organize the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: The long-awaited approval of the World Cup by FIFA 2026 for China and the Asian opportunities in 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, with Aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops to the FIFA its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea by European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (as the time delay), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had really away.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next.
The current head of state will be other candidate in 2012.
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the Mysteriums, the presidential function, not to.
So We must act as if the doubt henceforth.
In one, as well as in the other.
In 2006 the supporters Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that.
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious by his decision, "some time in the autumn of 2011".
On Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP members of the prospect of "two mandates" let slip, was thus a little Fieberhaftigkeit spread.
The official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President had just remind you that the constitution in 2008, the number of five-year term for just two.
He made a statement that no announcement.
It is not the first time that the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have the worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one In May 2010: "Does not believe that I do not think about the later stages."
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him more than the previous day, but also no less.
They should comment, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, Segolene Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS adopted earlier than to EU-diplomatic.
The bad polls on the other side.
The first time the voters would right a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to a survey by the BVA-L Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate with the UMP and there are no discussions about the environment of the prime minister responded immediately and carefully.
"If he were a defeat as possible, he would not candidate", Jean-Pierre Raffarin agrees with.
"He will always think to be able to win", Alain Juppé, with the Offenkundigkeit has resigned.
Euro: The ECB is forced to keep their purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to identify opportunities as they emerge from the crisis, or at least the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to announce the end of the year to its conclusion.
The crisis of European government debt obligation, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can certainly cannot afford to today's more than tense situation in the European bond markets, not part of the worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday during a press conference held by the ECB, active role in the solution of the Staatshaushaltsverschuldung of Europe welcomed.
She has not dared to say whether they thought that the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"my memories of my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president had the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament is not very eloquently about his plans, but rather, pointing out that the programme of purchases of government securities in the secondary market "would put and that we will see in the Assembly on decisions.
Only certainty: The ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases the treasure chamber last week by the ECB to approximately 1,35 billion euro doubled.
And according to the leaks of some traders, new purchases to Irish and Portuguese government securities.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases totalling EUR 67 billion.
Among the traders is the anticipation of a Weiterverfolgens the purchase rate never doubted (see page 29).
The economists expect no more remarkable change.
If the bond deals over three months will have disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still in the unrestricted cash reserves to freigiebige type, and over a period of a week up to three months.
The economists are already make today that this measure will extend for some months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend their program on essential nature".
"Otherwise they would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term, so Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"One For the course of the first quarter of 2011 nominated, progressive exit seems more likely," Norbert Bräms, economist at SAL.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their intervention in the market for government debt ", the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds to stimulate the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence on the market.
"It must at all costs to the Steller of investors in the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid on the most vulnerable states," bezeugte yesterday an important bonds holders.
Because if the interest rates set for the high-altitude flight, the states even more, to reduce their debt, or even to stabilise.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The government Berslusconi in Italy for cover
After a worrying weeks early, the situation yesterday with the decline in the Eckzinsen a little to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive stillness.
At the end of the meeting with the minister had the region, Giulio Tremonti, the situation as "unentzifferbar qualify him" and "unpredictable" weekend will have to listen to what the person concerned, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk are on 263 points, which caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy in Spain at the German rates of 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as "seriously concerned" by the "market turmoil and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy as Portugal is," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, this has to be part of the problem is Absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen tax receipts, the government, its funding needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the Senate is examining budget with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, it calculated the EU Commission, the budget deficit next year 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the will of what the governments promised 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7%).
Therefore the uproar about a new budget collectively, after the holidays to a total of 7 billion could be used.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountants Olli Rehn.
On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are governed repeat we have for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"At the moment there is no problem, either on short-term or long-term, since Italy despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. R.) the observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of the political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections will be held at the end of March.
It is therefore a little good session for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of the anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had it yesterday in a press conference in Paris explicitly stated: "I think that we are still on Sunday afternoon and evening: The Europeans clearly together, are ready and committed to defend its currency, as well as their currency area".
Although completely relative - of yesterday's withdrawal in the interest of European government bonds was grist to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
A normalisation start, however, is still not the case.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it had debt note of Portugal, perhaps the most effective target of speculators, lower today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems," the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since the political time passes much more slowly than the markets'.
The European countries which are both this gap and the danger is, well, intensify discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected and with their counterparts in the broader sense of the G20 is progressing well.
And this also in on the meetings of euro Groupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is the fate of the unconventional measures for the moral support of the countries of the euro zone in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
What the EU Stability Fund, whose executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in Singapour began his Asia tour to inform investors about the developments concerning the crisis in the Far East in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not strong, he is preparing the ground.
The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters news agency that the United States supported a possible increase in the additional direct involvement of the IMF mobilized Fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, in turn, structural reforms, particularly in the area of the labour market organization.
Reforms to the austerity measures, however, show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both one and the other is at any price, to avoid having to ask for international help, before they have their own budget corrective and on much-needed structural reforms decided that restores confidence in the long run.
The European investors, in their turn, have the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the markets of government bonds.

At the start of construction - the SGP, the state capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this system is the sum of the SGP is then in the markets, a part of the financial sum to her twin.
Today it is, after all, the first projections.
The supplementary budget by 2010, this morning by the Commission looked at the National Assembly, contains the planned measures, the first part of this money.
It is two measures: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of offices on the Ile de France.
The former, so remove Article 15 of the draft law, "the benefit of the public service Société du Grand Paris".
This is numbered: "the product of This tax amounts to 117 million per year.
Zweitere is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "In order to modernise it to increase its educational product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris's".
How much would this make?
A mystery.
This amount is not in the text.
Of the 4 billion is away.
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros of the Kapitaldotation being added by the State and the Société du Grand Paris and for the project to be done," is the explanatory statement.
In the SGP will take place this system not offensive at all.
"For the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, R.), the design over three years, and then only from the 4 billion windfall", it is claimed.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started, to note the 2014 4 billion for the budget.
This measure, the 4 billion promised there will be long, is in danger of a very eventful, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and busy spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a twofold significance.
On one hand, it proved to be an obvious scandal dictator, a scandal that only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, the citizens and the press.
On the other Hand announces it profound changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But we are going in the right order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any drafted by a secret service) composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything more than what you over several months anyway in any other Journal to read (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's offered Kabarettkünstlern for a very long time for their Sketche.
The principle of the secret dossier should only be already known news is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that every plant (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly what happened in previous works.
This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts does not want to publish enquiries (still therefore, that he would not know where exist to find), but because those who are the Okkultismus, nothing other than what they already know and confirmed what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
As the secret files.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (for example, it could otherwise be whatever editor in Libération), the only true considers what he acknowledges.
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who already Newsweek published the week before.
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier?
On one side suggests that any educated person already know and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Government can call each other or a plane, in order to make dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a couple of small have changed.
Any viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it.
However, the fact to repeat it publicly, violated the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place: The idea that an any old hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, is the most significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
In addition, rather than victims, the scandal the "Executioner" in trouble.
But we are the profound nature of what happened.
Previously, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool, every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would total victims of the eye of power.
But if we see what is happening today, that even the secret Krypten power no longer control of a Hackers can escape, to be directed Kontrollgang and will circle shaped.
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as avenger by the citizen - the secrets of power in experience.
How can a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton any power.
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused a big power?
It is obvious that the states in future no longer online information - that would be a reserved in the street corner angeklebten form.
But it is also clear that with the current technology in vain hope is confidential reports on telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of state in a plane and continuing contacted one of his colleagues.
How could in future private and only to some ears certain relationships?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and novel prison, but I am forced to imagine the government agents in secret way preoccupied on uncontrollable march routes shattering, their communications anywhere else than the mere memory of decay, and the few written information they received in the footwear (verbergend.
The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: Basically the Spionageversuch of Watergate had less success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology as a cancer progresses, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionised the communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) line.
The (analogue) video cassettes, the film allows them a film band for broadband auszukundschaften by forward from behind spulen and could reveal all mysteries of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs, today nothing other than from chapter to chapter to jump in macro-portions.
With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this including of switching requires three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not unusual that policy and communications technology come back to car and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times, the press to understand what secrets between the messages were forged.
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
Climate: As France Finanzversprechen table
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the quickly dissolved financing pledge (also called "fast start" or premature finance), which the developing countries.
And the rough French vulnerable to blandishments.
With the Copenhagen treaty the developing countries have committed to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has 7,2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to convince their partners of the fact of their commitment regarding the fast-start-financing: Detailgetreuer Vorgehensbericht its Member States, press conference, events, brochures distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and at valued for its real value: the developing countries and the society would like to see all developed countries did the same on the same accuracy level.
The EU announced that in 2010 2.2 billion euros to have released what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment, without detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain Member states, including France, the procedure blocked.
Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers the best.
The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009: The international funding are maintained, and 150 million in "the framework of the fast-start" over three years.
Other countries have similar standards, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of all new projects "of the year 2010 are" new and additional ".
In other words, there are no guidelines on the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the sum total of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional funding".
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus.
Some, such as France, 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously this is only reasonable that the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, for a donated euro... should also hijacked only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country than commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in terms than the following consideration: it "respected" his obligation of 420 million euros by 91.5% loan (389,8 million euro) and of 36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to convince themselves.
France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent.
Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort.
Fine Hokuspokus!
All in all, operates France in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: To A part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the period and partly with the reality of financial support.
France manage to think that 420 million "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promise and saves 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out) could be a double negative impact; even EU internally (why the other member states with the donations, if there is to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries not completely fooled...
The chapter of the premature funding only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much in the massive machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early funding.
In the first France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his obligations and the counterbalancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But especially France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing dispute (another and at the moment: You can escape The question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans.
France could alter his position to be just as progressive with regard to the disputes, as it is in other things.
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast-starting of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase the international confidence by nature, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarms - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years, on the day 81 different chemical substances, this Wednesday by the Association Générations futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations) study published.
The Association, said that its results "given the small number of analyzed samples reflect no statistically significant value, but illustration nature of the problems", usually within four between July and September, had a nearly 10-year-old child to the meals consumed food plus a meal in the supermarket bought in Oise and Paris.
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as biscuits of laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The author is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or probable carcinogens and five classified as safe karziogen klassifizierte as 37 substances with Endokrinin-glitch, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the virtually all of the cases the legal limit for each chemical individually held substance should not be exceeded, remove this collection is very good that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances or substances with Endokrinin-glitch is suspended, is worrying," said the union.
Already At the breakfast alone the butter and tea with milk already more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three sure as carcinogenic proven, as well as more than 20 residues, the hormone systems.
The apple imported from Brazil between meal for the study, contains traces of six chemicals, including one in France banned fungicide.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study traces of a strictly banned in the EU Insektizids said.
Furthermore, were also Hacksteak tuna from the Pandora, even the Baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses the presence of nitrates and Chloroform brought to light.
At the dinner was the salmon steak with 34 were identified, chemical residues in the "richest", and even for putting the meal in the microwave plastic plates used was not free.
The final finite risk this "pollutant cocktails" for consumers "will probably undervalued," the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV), "given the urgency of the situation has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the" increase in diseases of civilisation ".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues 365 different fruits and vegetables identified, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
