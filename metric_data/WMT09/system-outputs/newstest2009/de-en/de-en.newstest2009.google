The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of normal daily business. 
The Prague Stock Exchange established at the beginning the Tuesday burglary at the shops from Monday, when it for a further six percentage points dropped. 
This was the reason for the slump on Wall Street. 
Even in the Czech Republic shows as the reaction of the market on the outcome of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, which it had rejected a plan for stabilizing the local financial sector to support it. 
The case of shares in Asia 
A dramatic event witnessed on Tuesday the shares on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices during the day, a portion of the losses were offset. 
The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost during the business day almost four percentage points, but could later part compensate for the losses, thus reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.

"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Yam. 
Hong Kong determined, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, that is independent of the Chinese central bank. 
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States. 
The American lawmakers should be words of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as soon as possible to the negotiating table and return the draft to support the financial system to adopt. 
Otherwise threatened that other countries affected by the slump would be. 
A bloodbath U.S. equities 
The U.S. House of Representatives adopted on Monday the plan for support of the financial system is rejected, for up to 700 billion U.S. dollars (nearly 12 trillion Kč) should be spent. 
The legislators ignored the invitation of then President George Bush, the plan to support it. 
Bush would consider the plan the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help regulate the entire economy to stabilize. 
The U.S. equity on Monday witnessed a bloodbath, and the main stock indices showed the biggest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven per cent, a similar slump he had last recorded in 1987. 
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft in parliament would not pass, saw the index is a free event. 
Congress makes concession: U.S. government allowed 700 billion U.S. dollars in the bank pumps 
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed to form a broader agreement on a grant for the American financial system, agreed. 
To be voted on early next week. 
The American lawmakers reached in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a grant to the American financial system in an amount of 700 billion U.S. dollars (about 12 trillion kroner) a breakthrough. 
However, this still does not win. 
The Congress MPs have in fact still some details of the agreement to negotiate before the final version of the law and publish allowed to vote. 
The plan to support the financial system on Monday in the American Congress negotiated. 
On Sunday said notify the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of Reuters. 
In the Senate could be different According probably the earliest on Wednesday about the plan period. 
According to economists, a notification that the plan is adopted, the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets. 
Thereafter, however, come to a "sobering" because of the complicated mechanisms, how the markets also in practice might help. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have achieved a significant progress. 
We have our different views to clarify how a package to stabilize the market should look like, "said the agency compared with the Bloomberg democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to their words could have been on Sunday come to a final vote. 
Representatives of the legislators met on the night of Sunday with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, to the government fund its final form to lend. 
This provides for a buyout unsaleable assets of the mortgage finance companies before the companies in severe financial losses and topple the stability of the entire system at risk. 
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and on the market must also be effective. 
You need the recovery plan still continue, but I think we are on target, "said Paulson. 
A signal for Asia operations 
The global financial crisis is also evident in the equity markets, which greatly reduced. 
The words of the Democratic senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, according to the legislators had tried before Congress Sunday in a final agreement. 
So we wanted to investors before the shops on the Asian financial markets calm down, the first time zone, where a decision of Congress on Monday, the transactions could influence. 
So far, but is not yet clear when both houses of U.S. Congress to vote on the law, even confusion reigns over whether the negotiations at the last minute not yet a problem to fail. 
The legislators hope that in the next few days will be adopted. 
But the law will be some changes. 
The assistance for the system certain amount should be split into two parts are. 
The initial 350 billion U.S. dollars will be as soon as possible to be ready, as President George Bush urged. 
The Congress, however, the distribution of the remaining money to block if he has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, and in further 100 billion U.S. dollars, and later the final 350 billion U.S. dollars. 
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positive 
The president has made this decision with a veto, but the Congress can overrule his veto. 
Despite these changes, however, is the basic idea of the program are stable, which is based finance for the purchase bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen to obtain, because hundreds of thousands of Americans no longer are able to repay their mortgages. 
"We have everything prepared. 
The House of Representatives should be able, on Sunday to vote on the law, then the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
Satisfied with the progress also showed the American President Bush. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with the progress from Saturday and satisfied "both sides appreciate the effort that our financial markets to stabilize and protect our economy." 
Limiting golden parachutes 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, had stated, the legislators had a responsibility for the monetary program, to protect the taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of perks and a timetable for financing the agreed plan. 
The new law is also known as golden parachutes for directors of companies restrict the program are involved and sets up a committee to the oversight of the fund shall be. 
These should guide the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard and a big step forward in the direction of an agreement reached that works for the market and for all Americans is important," said Paulson. 
The plan will also work with an aid for homeowners, the problems with the repayment of their mortgage have. 
The new government should negotiate rates for mortgages, which they aufkauft, with the aim of the monthly costs for borrowers and to lower it to them to allow their houses to keep. 
Marek: Psychological Help 
The proposed plan is named after the principal of Patria Finance economist David Marek a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult. 
"And it's because we do not know by what mechanism and at what price the assets, be problematic. 
That will be crucial to how the financial sector and the Government of the losses among themselves, "Marek said this week the server iHNed.cz. 
Whether the plan now or early next week will be adopted, after Mareks view is not decisive. 
"Much more important is that the Congress MPs agree to the plan to support it and that as soon as possible. 
The psychological importance of the agreement that there is an adoption, is at this moment the most important thing, "said Marek. 
Duel at Razor's Edge: MP3 player against mobile phones. 
We advise you on your election 
While nearly every cell phone to play MP3 files, it can not yet a MP3 player phone. 
Therefore, it naturally is that it is better just to buy a phone. 
Despite everything, there are plenty of reasons why a player should be independent. 
The choice depends on the type of use and the demands from the future owner. 
Certainly it is difficult to buy at home for a great expensive turntables, pointed to the latest album by Maxim Turbulence listen to. 
Once such musical innovations appear not to LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason. 
However, you have LPs with type rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream about at least one such. 
So it's with the music to travel, so with compressed music, spoken - music in MP3 format. 
Even here there are price and quality categories. 
For one, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player spend eight thousand crowns, but is also Pink Floyd fan probably hardly headphones for twenty crowns from the market cope. 
Two extremes, between which there enough room for everyone there. 
The selection is broad. 
Even the battery life is crucial. 
Some good music player can be much more than just play music, but what can mobile phones, they do not even implicitly,. 
No modern equipment is only as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phone calls and the cornices, it may be music and videos play, both record, it has a better times, times a worse camera and can perhaps also navigate. 
And if you have the smartphones and communicators inclusive, you have almost a small computer in your pocket. 
There is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can broil and no TV pictures. 
But the universality of mobile phones also bring disadvantages. 
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will however need to reload. 
And the playing of music is one of the biggest energy eaters. 
Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours to play, mostly, it is much less. 
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) is significantly more powerful. 
Therefore, you should at the cheap phones reckon that they can not be longer than a few hours of music can play. 
If you then and still on the phone, buy you still prefer security to a charger for the office - even for more expensive equipment. 
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, including the less good hold at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a time of recharging. 
Another problem exists when the music on the mobile wants to play. 
Unfortunately, only a small portion of the device via a USB conclusion, it is also not every cell phone without special software directly to a PC. 
Of course you can the music directly to a memory play about, but few card readers without reduction with the tiny memory card ready to be used in mobile phones. 
For players, you need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
You only need the device via USB port with music from your PC to feed. 
Most mobile phones and players put themselves in a music library, arranged by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the tree from the address list, similar to the Windows Explorer, and some can be both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more 
When selecting a specific device, you should especially after the lifespan of the battery, the capacity, quality and type of sound and of course the ease of check. 
Your music is mainly scenery and you hear it every day just for example, in the tram, then extends to any mobile phone that plays MP3 files. 
What really almost any cell phone can be. 
You must also not control what music formats a mobile phone or any player can handle. 
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get is precisely in this format. 
The format is one of the most widespread and, moreover, most devices also music in WMA format play. 
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use). 
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online. 
It takes only about the mobile Internet pages of a provider (or another provider) will suffice, and you can a song or album. 
This service may already in itself a striking argument why we put on a music phone should be. 
Unfortunately, the range of providers and bad only limited mostly to rapid radio hits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
But generally it is believed that this kind of selling music (be it on GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future the music industry will dominate. 
The cell phone, the most for himself. 
If you want to listen to something, you after the phone in your pocket, while the player is forgotten at home. 
It is, however, indicate whether you are at least a headset or a wireless handsfree for them. 
If not, you can use the integrated speakers rely on almost any mobile phone features, but only a few MP3 players. 
Probably the biggest advantage of mobile music is for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand crowns. 
For three and four thousand crowns you already have a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap for most of that, no normal headphones are involved. 
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5-mm-opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the player is again in light of the operation. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see Selection) - Players can really serve everyone. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the normal sooner or cassette recorders, for example, the turntable is obvious. 
It threatens no collision in the form of an employee mistakenly mobile Internet, and then a horrendous bill for data transfers. 
After what device you should now draw 
Even the cheapest phones (eg Vodafone 527) are usually on a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.). 
Even if you are a card after purchase, ranging from two thousand crowns. 
But consideration. 
For the base models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. 
Only the most expensive may also 8-GB card read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and is still an inexpensive MP3 player want to buy, then take you to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, iRiver or Emgeton. 
Depending on the capacity (up to 2 GB), you must then not more than 1100 crowns on the table. 
They belong to the more sophisticated listeners, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the ease it comes to a single MP3 player approached. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, its mobile phones from the Walkman series of the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players. 
The same services at the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) make you MP3 player manufacturers of the above . 
The first virtual providers already this year after the Czech Republic. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fairly mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they also by their counterparts in Western Europe are offered. 
Yet something is missing here - a virtual providers, the traditional forces to lower prices. 
Maybe it will not be long in coming. 
That the Czech mobile provider to the most expensive in Europe at work, we have often reported on Mobil.cz. 
This also confirmed the Telecommunications Authority CTU, the attention made that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the final steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators will SMS from abroad cheaper than at home. 
How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? 
The answer is simple, it's missing the competition, which really makes a challenge. 
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of more than 100%. 
The mobile provider rant on the other hand, likes the fact that it is on the Czech market very much competition. 
The shares are often also the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (CTU), Pavel Dvorak, when, in the past had often expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier admit. 
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (Incidentally, he would probably barely find frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual manufacturer. 
Especially the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market saw a significant price reduction with him, then also on the traditional mobile service provider had to react. 
There were even before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain as similar votes in the Czech Republic. 
It has however shown that there is space for such providers and that they really can be successful. 
Incidentally, one need not long after to find examples. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual mobile operator in Poland, King reported. 
In just half a year, this supplier, more than 100 thousand customers to win and so on the fifth of the country aufzusteigen providers. 
Mobil King stands behind the financial group Penta, in the Czech Republic, inter alia, U: fon owns. 
The advantage consists of virtual providers is that you're on a much more specific audience can concentrate. 
To function effectively, you need virtual service providers to give customers much less than a classic manufacturer. 
You do not need relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world profile as the virtual providers usually as a low-cost firms out - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but often from a less extensive service offering is accompanied. 
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile SMS in Britain at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of Mobil King in Poland shows it may also be a good move, to a non-stereotyped target set. 
These providers is directed specifically at men. 
"Real men choose Mobil King - the providers, they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider. 
Hard to say whether a similar approach as in Poland and the Czech Republic could gain a foothold. 
Any doubt of the Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is a market segment, on which most virtual operators are based, relatively small. 
He is also from the viewpoint of the services offered relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic a chance, my mobile provider 
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider Czech Republic conquered, this is not King will be mobile. 
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic to see the negotiations not very hopeful from. 
It is befitting a king of mobile market in other countries of our region ", says in a telephone interview for Jana Mobil.cz Studničková, Spokesperson of the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly confirmed it so that the current mobile provider in the Czech Republic this idea does not subscribe. 
On the contrary, they try everything to do with the fact that no potential competitor arises. 
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile provider showed a long time since the group GTS Novera, a further step the company wants to create a real competitor to Telefonica O2 in the corporate sector to be. 
"We have a great interest to our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services. 
And the sooner the better. 
About this possibility we have repeated with all Czech mobile operators negotiated. 
With some of them we could already negotiating progress, "said the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
From unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider, perhaps by the end of the year is unlikely. 
So far, but this is from an insurmountable wall of silence surrounded. 
"In this moment we do not assume that in the Czech Republic Square for a full-fledged virtual manufacturer exists. 
The Czech market is large compared to other markets on specifics. 
So far, we have no subject with a complex and serious project in this area addressed, "says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefonica O2. 
On the specifics of the Czech market also other suppliers out. 
The press spokeswoman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds rare in accordance with the Declaration of O2 added: "So far we have not yet viable on both sides and beneficial project found, at which one could build further." 
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year, hardly a provider of virtual history. 
At this moment we already have a concrete offer have available, so as to be able to think short term. " 
Vodafone directed its attention more on the fulfillment of the requirements of its own 3G license. 
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure. 
We consider this just from the perspective of customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with suppliers hand in hand 
The approach of the mobile provider is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would result in lower prices and thereby also to a decline in profits. 
So why such a facilitate the entry of competitors? 
That the manufacturer to pull it if it goes to something also evident from the long back and forth to the emergence of U: fon. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of CTU went to the time when U: fon on the market came from the company from T-Mobile. 
The show also publicly available information from the CTU's websites. 
But now is precisely U: fon as an argument why a virtual providers should not allow. 
Kemrová Martina said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further exacerbated by the entry of a fourth mobile provider strengthened. 
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic is obvious that a new player in the market itself, and especially its services would put heavy demands. " 
Given this approach of the mobile provider puzzled, however, the absolute Disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not just about the attitude of the CTU, the Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other highly developed countries - has not the competence in economic competition to intervene. 
This has solely by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS). 
But this was about this issue throughout his typical attitude. 
"The entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible once there is a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual vendor on renting the necessary infrastructure has come. 
So far, no such agreement, because the offer was probably interested potential for the traditional providers are not sufficiently interesting, "said in his reply to our request Kristian Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS. 
By representatives of providers such a formulation would not be surprised. 
From a public authority, which represented the interests of consumers and others should make sure that nobody's position on the market abuse, this is more than questionable. 
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual operators are working quite normal, it is observed that their entry to a reduction in mobile phone services has contributed." 
But probably belong to the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price not to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking about this case is almost touching the line of the three mobile service providers, of their responses follows. 
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the very same gasoline at the pump certainly only a coincidence and the result of a fight is tough competition. 
"The authority in this case discovered no evidence that an anti-competitive behavior directed suggest, and therefore it has no reason to any kind in the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he also has not increased the responsibility for his actions on the market. 
The necessary tools for opening up the market for mobile virtual operators are missing probably also the regulator for telecommunications, "said Chalupa, in its declaration. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points. 
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets, prepared by the CTU, after the telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market, then of course none of the Czech mobile provider a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - for the entry of a virtual provider is always the consent of the operator is required. 
And the mobile provider has - logically - for his network's monopoly. 
Which means that he is in a certain segment necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if you but with this argument is not mitgeht, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile service providers strikingly similar way. 
These complaints show a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera), that they are in negotiations with all suppliers in a very similar obstacles. 
The shifting of responsibility to the CTU is in the telecommunications services is a fairly usual trick with which the ÚOHS from the whole affair distances. 
This was already in some similar cases to observe. 
Unfortunately, it did not succeed in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act extending the powers of the CTU to the field of economic competition in the telecommunications enforce, although a number of professionals including an improvement in the situation had promised. 
The representatives must ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It is already, if nobody look 
Ignored once the functioning of any pseudovirtueller suppliers from which it is in the Czech mobile networks are more equal. 
There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services spending, but only partly public. 
Normally it is namely to firms involved in multi-level marketing act. 
My mobile phone services, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others. 
The price of these companies usually only get to elect. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm towards the operator as a classical corporate client occurs, a large quantity of SIM cards ordered. 
As an important customer receives it then special price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile provider a similar kind of resale ban. 
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a breach of contractual conditions act with which we will employ, resulting in a termination of cooperation with the relevant society can lead," Martina replied to our question Kemrová about this issue. 
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing when the leaders of the mobile provider not herumspricht. 
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies can take thousands of clients. 
No operator is opposed to such an approach, however. 
From the activities of these companies that they are not negligible gains, while they - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - not by the actual official marketing impaired. 
To potential problems makes Miroslav Čepický attention: "The law allows such kind of speculation, despite all the services of these companies only by a very small percentage of customers. 
They must also accept that the SIM card in your phone does not run on their behalf, they can not fully have about how the ordinary customers of mobile service providers. " 
Alone, but the CTU should occur at least strange. 
In addition opens up another question for the ÚOHS. 
Sealing the mobile service providers such an approach before their eyes, why they lock themselves against a virtual provider? 
It should be added that the ÚOHS to detect such activities fairly strong powers, and if it does not want, it does not interfere with the Declaration of the providers, they knew nothing about it and its terms and conditions that would prohibit satisfied. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive is 
As the text has already been stressed repeatedly brought the entry of virtual operators a significant price decline for the various services themselves. 
They have practically in all countries where virtual operators have emerged, the traditional provider tries, whose emergence of virtually more or less to prevent. 
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a too small or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In highly developed countries but accessed precisely in those moments regulatory bodies, which can not protect the interests of mobile service providers, but those of their customers tried to maintain. 
Whether through formal or non-action pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators emerged, and this was followed by others. 
Unfortunately throw the Czech regulatory bodies throughout the case like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience, we can not discard the impression that ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than favorable. 
But let us not into the shotgun grain. 
When the background information is correct, and soon a virtual provider arises, will the Czech mobile market may soon set in motion. 
If a provider the emergence of a virtual mobile service provider allows, the ÚOHS not remain idle when it comes to other interested parties refuse (to discriminate). 
And the Czechs are then finally no more expensive phone than the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Find the best from 
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday presented Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Czech statehood in a ceremony of the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country. 
The new anthem was by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiri Bělohlávek recorded. 
There are four versions available - with a male or female solo singing in choir and in a version instrumental version. 
The singer's version over Katerina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
The agent of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav KRČEK. 
IHNed.cz on the server, you can listen to all four versions. 
Bělohlávek for the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns. 
Previously, he had told the Czech radio that he voted for the solo variations with young singers, selected representative voices, which are striking and popular. 
"From the outset, I have both and then also with the choir is trying to set a clear diction, so you understand the text well, so that a line is," said the conductor. 
The Czech National Anthem next year celebrates its 175th Anniversary. 
The song Kde domov Můj 1834 sounded the first time on the stage of the Estates Theater in the Czech piece originally Fidlovačka Kajetán by Josef Tyl, the music came from Frantisek Škroup.

The first verse of the song was then after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918 to be an organic part of the national anthem. 
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic. 
Sounds like the 'new' anthem 
The Prague transport operators carrying the first time on Wednesday on a chip 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, in the history of the Prague Transportation Company as a date on which a subway, tram or bus the first passengers embarking, the paper ticket instead of an electronic coupon in the bag bear. 
These can currently around one hundred thousand people buy the chip card are open. 
Passengers can get a 30-day, a 90-day or with a coupon (valid from January 1st, 2009) and buy these simultaneously on their smart card aufspielen leave, in the information centers and branch offices of transport companies in the Subway Muzeum stations, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská Garden, and Kacerov Luka. 
The coupons are also since yesterday over the Internet on the pages of Verkehrsbetriebe www.dpp.cz available. 
The service was up in the afternoon hours over four hundred customers claimed. 
Those who use the Internet sale, can the Output window in the subway stations really forget where they have regularly in long queues for their paper tickets had to wait. 
They buy the coupon is available on the Internet, will be raised at the Open this card in one of the thirteen branch offices of the city library. 
"At these places travelers is also a switch with trained personnel available to interested parties for the Internet and also advises buying the coupon on the map aufspielt," said the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný. 
In addition to the libraries can be electronic coupons to self machines on the open card aufspielen you can, in some metro vestibule are appropriate. 
What are those machines? 
They are red, reminiscent of Fahrscheinentwerter, the passengers, they have perhaps already in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská noticed. 
"Currently there are five of the city until the end of the year but it will be eighty," adds Opatrný added. 
The coupon controlled instead of the driver a vending machine 
The operation of the machines, which will operate from tomorrow, is simple. 
One has only to introduce the smart card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself on. 
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the area. 
So in the suburban trains and on buses with the numbers 300 to 499, which mainly residents from the communities of the region of Central Bohemia arrive in the capital. 
"In the trains for the Prague integrated transport include, the conductor readers with whom they validity of the coupons by time zone and examine," said Filip Drápal by the Organization Ropid the ticket control. This organization represents the timetable for the Prague transport companies together. 
The suburban coaches have card readers at the checkout at the driver. 
When boarding the smart card must not only be presented to the driver, but the card is open to a place marked on the side of the fund them. 
So that the driver had checked the validity-or coupons. 
"If a passenger is the validity of the check-or coupons, there is nothing easier than the driver to ask for this information," said Drápal. 
A passenger who is not with suburban bus departs and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons expire, you can turn to self-vending machines, where the coupons on the map anywhere. 
Here is the information on the validity of its documents on the screen of the device displayed. 
The Sudeten demanded by the United States a referendum 
The Sudeten Germans had in 1945 to the affiliation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States requested. 
This is from a letter appears in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library stores. 
If we are not part of Germany or Austria may be, so we want to at least under the auspices of the United States of America live. 
With such a request should be some 1945 groups of Sudeten Germans at the U.S. presidents have approached. 
This is, inter alia, a letter appears in a private archive is preserved and today in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library is kept. 
The Germans from Krumlov in the letter asking the American president that he should return the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler has been captured - in Czechoslovakia not afford. 
"We have the situation properly understood and we really want the words to be sure that American units, not as an oppressor and enemy enter German territory, but as liberators," it says in a letter with the words' people whom fate the Sudeten lies at the heart "is signed. 
Since the end of the Sudeten Germans Czechoslovakia - having regard to the Czech national character - suggests that they brutality, ruthlessness, ignorance, oppression and slavery would expect, ask the authors of the letter to the American president, for today and forever protect the rule over the Bohemian Forest to take over. 
"We can not believe you without regard to the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this territory us a foreign state award, the oppressed minorities and tried to remove and absolutely nothing to the victory of the Allies has helped", is in the letter to read . 
The reason why the author may not be able to write, is allegedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech oppressor." 
If the U.S. president to doubt the attitude of the Germans have Sumava, it was sufficient if he Böhmerwaldgau in a referendum that would initiate, whether the residents are part of the United States or under the aegis of the United States wanted to live. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of postwar history may sound a little naive, but he characterized according to some witnesses a good picture of the former expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even though the Czech Germans had at least guessed that one of their deportation from the Republic would negotiate, stood just a few of them such a possibility on break. 
Some waited that the United States and Britain for the Sudeten a kind of autonomy would negotiate. 
Still others believed that they could simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The well confirmed the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, which comes from Budweis. 
He was in the war as a Budweiser in the German navy in the Baltic Sea. 
When he was at the end of the war in British captivity, and it came in a POW camp after Holstein brought dozens more were Bohemian Germans to him, he should teach them Czech. 
"They believed if they heimkämen, they would be able to adjust the Czech come," said Chalupa. 
None of the German POWs who before the war lived in Czechoslovakia had expected his opinion that it is on the basis of the Benes Decrees from the Republic would distribute. 
Do not you think - and then pay! 
An emotive campaign is aimed at motorists 
Costliest action on the safety on the roads in the Czech history. 
So could the emotive media campaign characterized by the Transport Ministry wants to start on Wednesday. 
The authority of Prime Minister Ales Řebíček promises themselves drivers of dangerous behavior behind the wheel discourage. 
The campaign for 150 million kronor will be on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers run. 
It will be the drivers of driving too quickly and discourage drunk driving. 
And they also remind themselves before departure anzugurten. 
The campaign aims mainly young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least, professional drivers to talk about conscience. 
And what is shown in the commercials? 
Above all, stories of people who appeal to emotions. 
Also testifies to the "bloody" slogan throughout the campaign: 
Do not you think - and then pay! 
The words "do not" stand in capital letters on a plate. 
And in a pool of blood is then the word "pay". 
This should mean that you have a moment of inattention with one's own life can pay. 
The spots are the spectators in 2010 "shock". 
The ministry was of similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries inspire, where normal images with dramatic photographs of accident victims can see. 
It promises to themselves that as the number of accidents and the number of fatalities on Czech roads falling. 
The spots were approved by the agency Euro RSCG collected. 
Carrot and stick for motorists 
"For the drivers is the motto of carrot and stick. 
Carrot means that if they, for example, red drive, save time. 
The whip is the threat of a penalty or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "said traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Koran. 
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising is necessary, says the psychologist. 
Even less effective are his opinion panels, the driver on a threat to your attention. 
"If you have a static table, which warns against a danger it will probably soon with the environment verfließen, and the driver, they are no longer perceive," says Koran. 
Olmert would almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace to return 
The chairman of the Provisional Government of Israel Ehud Olmert has opted for the return of virtually all areas pronounced in 1967 have been filled, including the Jordan country, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights if in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria could close. 
This he said in an interview that on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot was printed. 
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians reach, which means that it becomes necessary, almost all (occupied) territories back, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper. 
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we are to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) must cede, because without it there will be no peace," he added. 
He acknowledged that an eventual return will also include East Jerusalem. 
"Those who want security in Jerusalem and especially do not want tractors or bulldozers roll through his legs, as one of my best friends happens, is a part of Jerusalem must renounce," Olmert said in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured. 
After words of the prime minister it will be necessary, a special solution to the Berne and sacred temples and historical sites "to find on the territory of the old town lie. 
"One of the Israeli sovereignty over the entire city wants to maintain, 270,000 Arabs will have to integrate. 
That will not work, "he reiterated further. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert called for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which it considers to be an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria. 
This would include some effort on the part of Damascus require. 
"My suggestion is not with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights to conclude peace," Olmert reiterated. 
"The Syrian know only too well what they have to renounce to the Golan Heights back. 
They are on their current relationship with Iran must renounce, they are on their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement must renounce, they are on the constant support must renounce that she terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al -Khaida and the Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq to grant ", specified the Prime Minister. 
Questions after the accident: Are illegal stewards on the bus? 
The law does not know it, in a Fernreisebus is not allowed to run around 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers during the ride on the bus back and forth herlaufen allowed. 
"Did we formally and strictly abide by the law, it is the activity of a stewards in contradiction to the Law on Road Traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, where last week a zweiundzwanzigjährige stewardess who was killed was probably by the driver of the truck caused the bus crossed the road. 
The young woman sat at this moment to do anything next crash the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although they are still two more seats had available. 
A bus can also be at the moment have an accident or sharp slowing in the Steward austrägt coffee or newspapers. 
Also plays a role, whether the bus after the vehicle's letter also is equipped with standing. 
If this bus is not provided, the passengers sit. 
The long distance buses from Student Agency does not have standing, what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, compared Aktuálně.cz confirmed. 
"We have discussed with the Ministry, and this is the first movement of passengers not approved. 
Later this has been withdrawn, and we are to reach a consensus that the passengers during the journey to go the toilet only if they have their seat, "he shared with his position. 
The law knows no Steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewards - no legislation describes this role. 
However, there is also no legal provision that prohibits the carrier to provide services. 
The Law on Road Traffic knows only the concept vehicle attendant, whose rights and duties are defined not, "adds the spokesman of the Ministry clearly Hanzelka added. 
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport says Joseph Pokorny, however, that the law covers this issue later. 
"It depends on whether the bus in product approval also has standing. 
That is everything, "he insists. 
Buses are divided into city buses, where there is standing there and the maximum speed is limited public transport buses with standing and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing with the maximum speed and seats, with seat belts equipped. 
As in the plane, says expert 
The BESIP for road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees the movement of the stewards on board a bus not a fundamental problem. 
"When a liquid driving threatens not many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an airplane. 
Also here is not sure when turbulence, and the stewardess can bump your head. " 
"Bremen coach, however, a sharp, then of course apply the laws of physics. 
Just as the city bus or a tram. 
The security of the Stewards, the carrier by internal regulations clarify, "he says and believes also that this issue from the perspective of the law is not fully resolved. 
Jančura is ready to cancel the services 
Student Agency offers the only Busfirma services of stewards. 
The company employs about two hundred people in this function. 
The director also sees her profession after the accident as being risky not to. 
"But once I get the impression that the occupation of stewards is risky, I will delete it. 
Coffee and newspapers, the travelers got. 
That would also reduce costs, "he says. 
As interest in the safety reasons, the Director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, the absence of Stewards in its buses. His company operates but only a fraction of lines in comparison with student Agency. 
"We have no stewardesses, resist, we have from the beginning. 
Sooner or later it ends with any fatal accident, "he had not quite one year for Týden.cz said. 
That was an unbelievable tragedy 
At a regular bus accident in Naples was a young stewardess from the region Pilsen accident, which for two years the company had worked. 
The Slovenian truck was probably without a blink of the state strips and turn the bus had blocked the trip. 
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck. 
That the two seats for the stewards were sold, denies Jančura. 
"These places can not be reserved in remote, they are blocked." 
Company wants to sue truck driver. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the Agency will not wait for the court verdict, a financial damages they expected but also by the culprits. 
A legislative amendment? 
Not in sight 
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a coach could bring a statutory scheme involving a dreißigköpfiges team of experts of the Ministry of Transport already operates more than a year. 
"This however is still no concrete conclusion. 
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving, "said specialist Hořín. 
"The Ministry of Transport considers the activities of the stewards not as something that the safety of passengers could jeopardize much," said Hanzelka, while monitoring the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the Occupational Safety and Health authorities. 
Duesseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt 
At large lacks words in the letter of WestLB's board to the staff of the House not. 
Through a merging of units of the Düsseldorf bank with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could be "the central banks of the House Capital Markets Financial Group" which says the known on Monday letter. 
WestLB would be a "competence bloc" with sustainable earnings power in such a business. 
And on such a connection is the decisive impetus to other lung Bünde in the Landesbank sector. 
To read it, if an executive at a difficult time to demonstrate ability to act. 
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure. 
Not only from the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, the North Rhine-Westphalia state government recently has made clear that the time short, a future solution. 
As always, by a kind of liaison between the Deka-Bank, the savings for their customers know Investment Fund, and WestLB is, however, been some time since the speech - also on the Frankfurt side. 
Although Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas in the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August know, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Landstrasse with a Landesbank, or approximately Helaba WestLB, he can see no sense. 
However, the Board of Deka, each half of the country's banks and savings associations is taken, the board instructed, with WestLB talks on joint activities to lead. 
This might be the capital markets business or parts of it go. 
The talks have admittedly, it is said the financial center, has only just begun. 
From the Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees on the major employers in the financial center of Frankfurt counts is not the first time the speech, when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
2003, for a moment, it seems as could Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba merge. 
For this tripartite covenant, however, was nothing. 
No sooner were the plans became public, said the Hesse state government against a participation of Helaba them. 
The other two houses were then not each other. 
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart. 
But there have always been mind-games on a combination of the Deka-Bank country where banks. 
Recently, however, had Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba, games against plan on a merger with pronounced his house. 
Regardless of which seems to mature recognition that a combination of the various houses backing of the public service sector need doing. 
Now that the state of Bavaria has passed, it could be the first to connect BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg closer. 
For Helaba is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure for further mergers increase, going after her and after the partners in favor. 
In the south they would nurmehr junior partner, although the financial crisis so far has durchstanden much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A merger with West LB in turn, the Savings Bank and Giro Association Hesse-Thuringia, with 85 percent of Helaba is involved, the beginning of the year put an end to. 
Would remain if all the Nord LB. 
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side. 
On the other is about the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit. 
In June, said Merl, the crucial question of what business the future viability of the country's banks should be ensured, either by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association have not been answered. 
At the end could include a dismantling of West LB, which, however there obviously is not desired. 
That is because even in the letter of its Bureau which said it would in any case a "total solution" for the house sought. 
As with the combination of individual units with the Deka-Bank can bring a hat, will tell. 
The second Oktoberfest weekend, as "weekend Italians known 
For Elena, this is the first, Luca for the third or fourth time 
But this time, Elena as his girlfriend with it, and so was everything else, he says. 
Behind them, the five-liter barrel of beer brand Imperial, a massively built and bearded proves the Oktoberfest about 200 passengers, how deep tones can spawn his throat. 
Elena Luca gives only one slap, then a kiss. 
From Bologna, they came to Verona. 
From here, the coach park next to the station Puorta Nuova, to start this evening at 23.45 clock four buses, "Destination Monaco, festa della Birra," is expected to arrive 6:30 clock. 
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in a bus traveling exclusively Brazilians. 
In a corner of the parking lot next to sing the South Americans have their flag, they have already celebrated in the night. 
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it was not for the Italians. 
Marco, a long coat with Pelzimitatfutter and glasses with large silver ironing bears are the buses. 
For five years they go to Oktoberfest, three tours are there this year alone. 
Night out during the day at the Oktoberfest, at 22.30 clock back. 
Staying on would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco. 
75 euros will cost the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed true to the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has a voice in Frankfurt course visited - including. 
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero." 
There is no beer, not yet. 
It will quickly calm in the bus, passengers sleep. 
Well then, they will still need their forces. 
Kept in at Brixen and wooden churches, where several other coaches with Italian flag on the motorway 8 shortly before the Munich once again take a break. 
Marcos as a group finally scheduled to clock six thirty in the morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese arrives, there are already at the 50 other coaches from all over Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, said the attack plan. 
First: The yellow caps up. 
That is left "Oktoberfest in fracture, along with the Internet address of Marcos travel agency:" conoscersiviaggiando.it. " 
Secondly: "If the doors to the tent up, it is running!", Marco calls in the morning inside. 
"Running!" Running and the seats in the rear portion of the tent filled. 
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, distributed in space!" 
The measure, roars Marco, cost 8.25 euros. 
And gratuity not forget. 
"The security people show that we behave well! 
Once you leave the places, they're gone! " 
Third: "Tonight point half past ten einfinden back here!" Understood? 
And voila! For Oktoberfest. 
Pleasure binds a yellow caps as milestones in the trees to plates and even on the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party. 
We want the withdrawal of its armed. 
It is the second Oktoberfest weekend, as "weekend Italians known. 
Accurate information on numbers, there is not, the speech is of 50 000, based on the way over the Alps and into the beer tents invade, ten percent of all visitors this weekend will be extra angereist be from Italy. 
The Munich police will by seven policemen from South Tyrol strengthened Italian volunteers assist the Bavarian Red Cross, a Nations statistics performs, in which the Italians against the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies for first place show. 
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräuhaus tent. 
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system was relatively stable, said federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck only in the past week. 
How well that the politicians the word "relatively" used and even einflocht that the German banking sector developments of the crisis will not be spared. 
Because the weekend is now occurred. 
The Dax in Munich quoted real estate financiers, Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is a consortium of German banks billion loan to itself from the turbulence in the markets abzuschirmen. 
A person familiar the situation told Reuters on Monday, the credit support amounted to up to 35 billion euros. 
Hypo Real Estate should only pay interest on the part that they also qualify. 
The money come from both private and public banks. 
Background losses at the subsidiary Depfa. 
The state had financiers, according to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, refinanced extremely short notice - which because of distrust in the markets now is no longer possible. 
In the first half of 2008 was the cash reserve of the Bank by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros shrunk, the equity ratio had slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent relented. 
The current income and net income from financial transactions were compared with the same period last year dropped to zero, the proceeds from additions to certain assets and securities as well as from the release of provisions for loan losses by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher income from refunds of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the repayment of interest after the tax code and the management of group companies, had revenue of around minus 16 percent can still be modest. 
The formerly state financiers had after its privatization in 1990, initially with commercial real estate loans verspekuliert, then in Aareal Bank had been outsourced. 
Because we in the classical state funding earned too little, the Depfa then reinforced in infrastructure projects and the funding of community projects by private investors and the government committed (Public-Private Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
On the value of the subsidiary Hypo Real Estate write-offs now make a "substantial material" effect on the profit and loss account of the group will have hot it is quite vague. 
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted. 
Already in 2007 it was reduced by two-thirds were. 
Hypo Real Estate is Depfa since the takeover a major state and infrastructure financiers. 
It is stronger than other institutions from lending in the interbank market, since it has no customer deposits. 
With the collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago is among the lending banks again versiegt largely because the banks are hoarding liquidity. 
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a portion - about 50 billion euros - Depfa of the loan to refinance short-term funds. 
Upon notification of Hypo Real Estate, is the financing needs of the group with the credit for the foreseeable future and the company met "by the influence of the currently largely funktionsunfähigen international money markets" screened. 
From other sources is to hear that, thanks to the refinancing of the funds until the end of 2009 was secured. 
The HRE chairman Georg Funke said, but that the Hypo Real Estate Group the money markets for the foreseeable future will no longer qualify for them. 
Bundesbank and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the marketability of Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured. 
That stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank hoped. 
But given the dynamism and unpredictability of the crisis there is no certainty. 
It is not even inconceivable that the financing is not fully utilized to be. 
But the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
After late on Sunday evening rumor the bank before the insolvency, can also at least temporary rescue the minds not to calm down. 
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros. 
Pretty good hold, however, the bond rates. 
During the primary debt barely moves show, the prices of subordinated bonds after clearer. 
It affects mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Hypo Wuerttemberg and understandably have maturities beyond 2009. 
Seem Hypo Real Estate bonds formerly a speculative investment alternative, then their value following the sharp aggravation of the banking crisis and the institute itself, with the acquisition of Depfa until the crisis had brought to the house than the stability of the international financial system to be dependent. 
As long as the banks, governments and less depressed commercial banks to support the system ready yet, as long as may be extended by the timely repayment of pensions to be. 
Or it occurs that, which is currently hardly anyone dares to hope - that the financial crisis in the coming 15 months is overcome. 
But given the deal with the partial nationalization overturning the messages is from the safety of probability bordering currently only has become a legitimate hope. 
The expected long-term creditors, especially some sleepless nights preparing with the decision, whether they are separated from their commitment to. 
Short-term investors can still draw a line to use a loss carried forward for future tax payments to cover exchange gains later years to form. 
Sylvana and the mysteries of the Bento Box 
As Hiltrop Sylvana, 16, on the first school day at the Tachibana High imagine to catch on to the girls giggle: The German is totally "Kawaii"! 
What that means? 
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange-log tells them from Japan. 
"The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before school, I had Bammel. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in Kawasaki and leaving 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School. 
The way I had to find alone, fortunately, I have not lost. 
The lessons start at Tachibana seems not so strictly defined as at our home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils from the age of eight spin clock, until eight forty to a brief round meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'. 
But before the lesson began, I was in the series, introduce myself. 
I am not the guy who likes to speak before the people, even before a class of 40 students. 
Because I still had no school uniform, I have an old rock my host mother dressed, this blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes. 
In this elevator I was before the lectern and tried everything right out: 'Where she Sayonara Sylvana ...' - My name is Sylvana, come from Germany and had birthday in a week. 
At the moment, I was very glad that I had a good two years before starting had to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have all getuschelt, gekichert and gewunken and I constantly have the word "Kawaii" belongs. 
That I already knew from my manga. 
It belongs to überlebenswichtigen vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '. 
Then I quickly to my place gehuscht. 
The girl next to me has pretty broad gegrinst, they thought it was an honor that the exchange student should sit beside her. 
The rest of the day was fairly quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was downright assails. 
All spoke up and asked me kicherten and holes in the abdomen - it is really difficult to understand Japanese to English. 
In the break then grabbed all of their Bentos. 
My host mother had me as a Lunchbox made - that is something other than the desolate German break bread. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and meat in a kind Tofumantel. 
Mostly, I have no foggiest exactly what I eat here in Japan. 
The odd things to see and taste completely novel. 
It is clear that everything is really tasty. 
Well, up to the salty preserved plums, perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos at Japanese schools are not just lunch. 
It sometimes requires that a girl a boy a self-prepared bento gift, which they then herrichtet particularly artful - in the hope that the boys at the snack closer to learn. 
I like this in my manga comics to read. 
I'm anxious times, if I can watch here. 
'Why is precisely because Japan?', My friends have asked me when I told them that I for one year in Tokyo wants to go to school. 
I've always said: 
"Because I am fascinated times now." 
Finally, I read many years favorite manga. 
And so I comics and the culture is better understood, I have also begun sometime, a bit to learn Japanese. 
So for me it was quite clear that I eventually had to stay here. 
Because I have a penchant for tradition, customs and traditions. 
And the people attach great importance here. 
Japan is one country the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, I am also not yet felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. " 
Even rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees when danger is that it also feels fear? 
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced, too many animals have feelings. 
But how could we check whether they feel the same if they are similar to how we behave? 
In the Internet magazine "Edge" have been used for several years, contributions of famous scientists published. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected in a series of answers to the question "What do you think are true, prove it without them?" 
I believe that animals sensations and other states of consciousness, without that I or anyone else that could yet prove where we can not even prove that other people have consciousness. 
But in this case, at least we hope, because all human brains same basic configuration. 
But when we turn to other species and issues of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness touch, we enter the roughest terrain, because the hardware does not match. 
When a rat in danger, she is doing the same as many other animals: it is dead, escapes or attacks. 
People behave similarly, leading some scientists to a similar close subjective experience. 
I think it does not. 
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult, our subjective experience of animals to be transferred. 
On the one almost always conclude with the human consciousness associated circuitry the lateral prefrontal cortex one (because of his involvement in the short-term memory and the execution / control functions). 
This broad region in humans is much higher than in the other primates and other creatures seem to be missing entirely. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, the prefrontal cortex depend, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, therefore consists reason to believe that the man even from the other primates differs. 
Another dramatic feature is expected in the linguistic nature of humans is: Because such a large part of his experience with language, are often the consciousness depends on it. 
In this case, one could exclude animals. 
But even if not consciousness of language abhinge, this would certainly affect it so that animal consciousness, as might be set up, probably very different from most of our states of consciousness differences. 
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness in other animals look like. 
If it is, as something internal and subjective, yet neither measure because of the specific hardware, using our own experience, analyze it, it makes us his research with great problems. 
Most of my remarks refer to the contents of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, science should be easily accessible. 
One could sense the processes of animals without regard to their contents examined, and that is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization. 
But in this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick went after, we moved more on the neural correlates of consciousness as to the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or not. 
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the Formation of visualization. 
What is now responsible for the sensations? 
I'll do it due to the fact that an emotional system such as the fear in one of his own conscious brain activity is activated. 
What we call "fear" described, is the mental state in which we find ourselves, if the activity of the brain localized defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) memory occupied. 
Seen sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex bound, the primates, and especially the people excel. 
Linked to the linguistic nature are subtle gradations of feeling, because we are using the words and grammar states can differentiate and categorize, in addition to ourselves and others attributed. 
By contrast, says Antonio Damasio, for example, that feelings of primitive activities in the regions of the body feeling and the cerebral cortex tribal Jaak Pankseep show similar, but the more focused on the brainstem. 
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed, it could mean that cross-species sensations involved. 
Theoretically, I can not contradict, however, think it unprovable. 
Pankseep argues, what in rats and humans appear as fear, probably also felt in both cases so: But how can you verify that rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? 
A cockroach flees at risk whether they felt fear? 
In my eyes can conduct simple similarity does not prove experiencing equality. 
While helping the neural comparison further rats and humans have similar brain tribes, cockroaches are not even a brain. 
But the brainstem is responsible for sensation? 
And even if this could prove to the people: How would you prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), Have feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove. 
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours differ (as the human consciousness in specific circuits and is based on language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats. 
If any progress here winking at the neural level, if we in rats and humans the same measure.

One may hold intended for short-sighted, but I prefer to come forward, as ever against a wall to run.

Due soon freezing fuel lines, it is in danger now of Kältetod. 
Among scientists ensures years a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the swing-by anomaly. 
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, which she added momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth, will receive.

Rather, there will be irregularities in speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower. 
So far, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptized him swing-by anomaly. 
Some experts fear that perhaps the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein, the attraction of matter by a curvature of space describes not quite true could be. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes firmly that Einstein was wrong not, and tries to swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter to explain the astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which is also near the earth could find," he writes. 
Of the existence of dark matter of space researchers know only been around ten years. 
It is obviously an attraction, their effect on other celestial bodies can be observed. 
She herself is completely invisible, which means it transmits and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists makes the dark matter still good fifth of the total mass of the universe.

Obscure street in town, often forgotten, and possibly soon to sell 
New York City has thousands of major roads, alleys, side streets and other bypass roads, some famous and others are just comfortable. 
Nevertheless, it is even for experienced taxi driver and longtime residents difficult to say where the extra place is located, simply because most have never heard of. 
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street northbound between Bowery and Second Avenue, without the Second Street to reach. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty lane as actively used after a passage from street. 
There is also no street signs. 
It is practically impossible for them to a standard road map to find. 
This road has yet their admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently luxury building on First Street has built. 
It wants extra Place new paving, to a clean passage to the shops and boutiques, in the new buildings are expected to create. 
Among the other admirers include longtime neighborhood, who says she was fascinated by the short street, simply because they are one of the remnants of the past is the blocks. 
But the city administration department, for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in them to receive. 
During a meeting of the Committee for the municipal land this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay, a proposal for the purchase of road construction companies through the design. 
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road in the hands of the city remains, and has prompted a new plan in the next month will be submitted to Susan Stetzer, district manager in the municipal 3rd 
"Very little space is owned by the city stayed and we want to continue Extra Place is one of the city," she said. 
"It could give offerings, how to repair the road and operates what could be done Avalon, but we also want the public access remains guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced several months ago, the small street paving and new seats set up, inter alia, for a cafe are thought to which the company wants to rent space. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street, was the first time during the meeting this month made public. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman of Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road while, but it would not necessarily possess. 
"The main concern of Avalon Bay, it is these renovate dilapidated alley and a public meeting to make," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Buildings Department for Protection said that it was indeed the desire of the town been selling the street, and stressed the role of the department it was more likely to develop the property than to manage.

The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which in 2006 was closed, opened to extra Place and the road is certainly the most famous as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones. 
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, the photo in November 1976 had made. 
The street was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, newsletters and ropes. 
Some residents, including bloggers who have the gentrification of the East Village to write, the idea of selling extra Place refused, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is to continue to remain publicly. 
Others have extra Place praised as a rarity - a virtually unchanged factions of the city, the rest should be allowed.

The author, Brendan Gill, has had written: "Extra Place is a small cul-de-sac close, even during the day is dark and rusty metal door of the warehouses, sealed windows and rain gutters gone flying week-old newspapers characterized." 
With few exceptions, the road just as recently at a ausgesehen evening. 
A rat ran through the rear portion of the street, not far from the door, which previously led to CBGB, where today a more expensive apparel business is located. 
Graffiti on the walls were visible, and an empty beer bottle lay on the ground not far from a fresh set of discarded newspapers. 
Some passersby said they had rarely have extra Place thought, but suggested that the road could be somewhat refurbished.

Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in Kalifonischen studies and executive director in the Department of Education Studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice." 
The Hispanic voters to be addressed is a complicated task. 
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example. 
Obama's campaign noted that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students to school successfully, is lower than for white students" - what is wrong. 
To this performance gap to close, we recommend Obama's education plan, especially among others a transition phase in bilingual education for those who learn English only. 
However, there is a question for Obama is whether its use for bilingual education, focusing on education in languages other than English sets, contrary to his interest, the gap in the school to reduce benefits. 
Take for example "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country to learn English. 
Nevertheless, in 2008 astonishing 100 percent of fourth grade students the state test in math at a good level existed. 
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school in the English test than good. 
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those which are favored Obama. 
The school Sixth Street presents its emphasis on reviewing and exercise, to steady control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions. 
In addition, the school practiced the approach, after training in an English-speaking environment runs. This is precisely the point that Obama should be noted, says the head teacher Linda Mikel. 
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in specialized classes. 
Ms. Mikel, the idea of bilingual education declines, said to me, the school would have been a remarkable success with a student who only shortly before had come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and it no longer can recognize. 
"It works," she remarked that "it works for us." 
Obama would be a school such as the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other students are learning English? 
The benefits of the school would be the answer to this question lightly, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and its consistent support for bilingual education to make predictions about Obama's uncertain response. 
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivializes the issue, he remarked that people should cease to worry about the "English only" legislation aiming to make. 
Instead, he said: "They should make sure that your child may be Spanish." 
If Obama the performance gap really want to close, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and to trivialize. 
The oil price declines due to fears of renewed economic 
The oil price on Monday because of fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive economy, have fallen. 
Crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange are trading in the morning session up 7 percent to $ 99.80 per barrel dropped. 
Since last Monday, the price increased by more than $ 20 declined. 
In the last two weeks are the product markets, both from the financial turmoil on Wall Street and as well as powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico has been shaken. 
After the prices in July its peak of $ 145.29 per barrel had achieved, they are in this month to almost $ 90 per barrel dropped, then again, as a consequence of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets, to rise. 
On Monday, investors have already shown concern, although Congress representatives had announced that they had at the weekend on a rescue plan, the largest in the history should be. 
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis still far from being completed was. 
The moment the last chapter of the growing crisis, should, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup, the Bank of shops to buy Wachovia Corporation. 
Meanwhile have Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments of the European financial group Fortis partly nationalized. 
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, it is despite the tense negotiations, which took place at the weekend and a rescue plan led, apparently not succeeded, the mood in the markets to revive. 
As the economic situation continued to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, including for oil, will continue to fall. 
Analysts at Deutsche Bank in a note to investors, who forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become highly uncertain. 
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets also will be affected. 
"From the perspective of product markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus is spreading globally, particularly to China." 
The analysts of the bank have their expectations for oil because of weak economic growth for next year revised downwards, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for the year 2009 by 20%. 
Team record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after it in the last eight years, more than any other in-Jets jersey auflief. 
Then he saw on Sunday in the second quarter in which the Jets a performance-free game turned into a triumph. 
"It is something I've never seen," said Ellis. 
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, began the second quarter. 
But quarterback Brett Favre pass in Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown arrived, marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon in which their evolving collaboration a giant step forward made. 
Favre found Coles in this district for two more touch downs, a Foreign times as a defender ausrutschte and other times 10 seconds before the end of half time. 
"I am not particularly strained," said Coles on the passes to Coles declined. 
"He is a super player. 
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think. " 
While Favre played catch and Coles, began the defense of quarterback Kurt Warner apart. 
Foreign defenders Darrell Revis caught a throw from injured and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught it. 
Linebacker David Bowens then cared for a loss of Warner. 
The last ball loss, forced to Bowens, was probably the craziest. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds still left in the game as the Jets won the ball back and Jay feely a 20 yard shot on 34 to 0 transformed leadership. 
That was the most points the Jets ever quarter had reached. 
When he was asked the madness to describe replied Erik MANGINI, the coach of the Jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?" 
Answers to both, because the Jets were in the third quarter to 21 points without a single to reach MANGINI said: "Believe me, I did the second quarter more enjoyable than the third. 
A lot of points were achieved in a short time. " 
Gebrselassie rested his world record suggests 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown once again why some of them for the best long-distance runner of all time keep after it in the Berlin marathon on Sunday broke his own record and become the first man is the route of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 Hours and 4 minutes managed. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie has his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds improved the last year he had reached in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has its 26th World record in his versatile career statements in which he at any distance of one kilometer marathon until at least one World Cup title is reached or has set a world record. 
Last month, Gebrselassie the Olympic marathon in Beijing omitted from fear, in retrospect perhaps exaggerated was that the pollution his asthma problems could worsen. 
Instead, he has to race in Berlin pending. 
In almost ideal conditions - when the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - has Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile won. 
Since train runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has increased by more than 2 minutes fallen since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06: 05 won. 
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie has informed the press that he had two weeks ago cramps in his calf and had therefore could not train one week. 
Obviously, he is refreshed after break and not come back rusty. 
"I'm so happy," he told reporters. 
"Everything has gone perfectly. 
I have the training a week ago and had resumed still some concerns, but in the end everything was great. " 
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia rivals from East Africa - that he heats his overly orchestrated, many of world's best marathon stars generally eschews themselves too much on the Rennanführer leaves, as if the race would be a train, and world records on the race presents. 
But this criticism harms the size as long-distance runner Gebrselassie unlikely. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie was the center of the line in 1:02:04 achieved. 
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie still have challenges after the pace-maker had waned. 
Slightly more than three miles before the finish Gebrselassie has made his last inaugural to be separated from Kwambai who as second in 2:05:36 arrived and thus its best by almost 5 minutes has improved. 
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48. 
In women has Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, a remarkable year by the siebtschnellste with 2:19:19 outcome of all times has shown. 
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain. 
In last spring had the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly the London Marathon in 2:24:14 won. 
It has missed games in Beijing, due to problems which were described back injury. But she recovered to win in Berlin and her best in her third marathon five minutes in order to improve. 
She has run its cleverly planned by a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners could only tear, but after 30 kilometers obsolete. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya third in 2:25:01 as arrived. 
The pride and the strains in the life of the black population in a city very special 
Hidden between the excesses of the theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, loud and gigantic driving away, is a quiet town where the pride and the complications of African-American culture come to light. 
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons is no longer so easy to describe Hurston as it did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no jail. " 
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville came to the famous author of the Harlem Renaissance to remember. 
And still is and remains the city which she describes - and made it a tourist excursion made by them in the Florida Travel Guide started to periods of depression by the Federal Writers Project was produced - in many ways a place of very special variety. 
Eatonville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused, their true thoughts with the white man to share the "so little about us knows that he does not know what escapes him. " 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, an open conversation about race relations calls, there are many here still tired of outsiders to be observed. 
"We are very anxious how our story is," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the town and municipality member of the oldest church in the city. 
It must be right. " 
Eatonville was a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight defined. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 residents, where the poverty rate twice the national average. 
It is both a stronghold of literature and an example of - and sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, its roots in American slavery has. 
It is not surprising that residents here both proud and are on the alert. 
And thus began the reservations right to Eatonville's image with Zora actually, as everyone here Hurston call. 
They presented the world their home town in books, which came from the heart and were written in dialect, as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guides changed the city, near the Route 77 is a road through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads to the scenes of black history and human drama. 
Naughty as Oskar, both in real life as well as in literature, led Hurston readers to the store's first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, and then turned to private affairs. 
"Off the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-angestrichene white modern school, with their manicured gardens and playgrounds, around which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he barely can read and write." 
They also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and Glenn Lee wrote that "any kind of drinks sold and also what-ever-fit bedrooms to hours." 
In just a few hundred words brought Hurston So Eatonville with self-government, in conjunction, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a guide. 
In fact, this was not a portrait, which was appreciated by all. 
"Zora describing things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by the men cited, the songs about the beauty of their singing, which were full of sexual innuendo. 
She added: "Some people do not want this." 
One remembers here is still to Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, was withdrawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston in the city gebraust came, they usually did without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city which even today is something on their clothing style venerable einbildet. 
According to Mr Franklin was the most fascinating inhabitants, whereas many of them despised. 
"People were always glad to see Zora," said Mr Franklin. 
But "they never stayed too long," he added while he rocks in his chair, on a terrace located to the rear, which overlooks the lake Sabelia in which Hurston in all likelihood was baptized. 
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and their books out of print. 
Together with the bulk of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them. 
Although it was once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave buried. 
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremony, no public readings in great style. 
"I do not think they have their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 80s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige highway through town, in order to the Kennedy Boulevard to replace the slow pace of the two main community. 
Orlando suburbs had already Highway 4 through the western outskirts pushed. 
The proposal was submitted as Eatonville is still a difficult period in its history recovered. 
Forced integration, among others, had the relatively idyllic isolation of the community to an end. 
In the'50s brought the struggle against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"In this period was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the outside sedentary people," said Mr. Franklin. 
"There was even once assisted a woman was killed. 
They threw a water melon from the car. " 
Hurston questioned in 1955 in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by its decision in the Brown case against the school as "insulting my race instead of respecting known. 
Nowadays, residents say that although the abolition of racial segregation in some ways positive, they are the group cohesion in Eatonville and self-consciousness of his young weakened. 
"Black children were accustomed to it, hugging to be - I remember - you hugged his teacher in the morning and you hugged his teacher in the evening," said NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville Community . 
That was so long be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place. 
"We hugged his white teachers not because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural divide exists," said Mrs Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights helped to make space for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists who have sat across prejudices, as it did, with a positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can anyone Joy I refuse to society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975 the writer made himself Alice Walker on the way to Hurstons unnamed grave and began to revive her fame to fight. 
Five years later was a much-praised biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway in the bookshelves to find, and she again become a part of the American literary canon. 
The highway project came precisely at a time in which Eatonville famous daughter again in the light of the public stood. 
And this time Hurstons old neighbors saw it as a savior. 
The community began in 1988 with planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration back. 
Some years later turned to the district from its road construction plans. 
"The plans of a busy highway fünfspurigen the city accelerated the whole thing with top speed, aroused genuine pride citizens," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier out: "Zora rescued Eatonville." 
The victory against the highway project has led to a change in the self-image of the town. 
It came more and more arrived, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who since 1993 here in the church, and locals started the past to re-estimate. 
Eatonville was established in 1998 in the historic nation-wide register. 
A new single library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten embellished and Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when only 27 black families in the 1880ern was founded. 
(She is now 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution. 
For most interviews is a necessary permit in advance and some things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, by a painted white and black men in the field work - may not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a penchant for dark, still fear that their community shielded misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time the larger Hurston Festival, was also an elevated level of hometown pride born. 
Especially young people tend to Eatonville so to see how Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and equally proud, creative and industrious, and mixed silly as any other racial group and peoples in the Americas. 
It is the sincere love for this city to the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, the college plans after Eatonville after returning to the city administration or the police to work, which according to him could use some help. 
And even the younger ones, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned Eatonville correct to describe. 
"Most people who are just passing through here, will think: 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after church. 
"But if you actually stop for a moment, and his story, it is a very beautiful city." 
Here in New York, one speaks fluent Latin Finance. 
At first glance, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square away, they would not even notice that they are in the midst of a debacle there. 
You would never believe that over their heads, in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with glass facades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter the monopoly in New York, the worst daily horror workday since the stock market crash of 1929 have. 
The supplier still push with the loud metallic clatter Teewägen along sidewalks and carrying trays with muffins for the breakfast meetings are loaded. 
Latinos still shuffle between apartments around how human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts, with one lying on their shoulders the yoke-like hanging rod. 
Clerical still to wait on the sidewalks by local food stalls on their Frühstücksbagel and it is still impossible on a weekday from 16 to 19 clock a yellow taxi to get. 
It felt absolutely not as a crisis until I Thursday afternoon due to all the doomsday talk decided to establish a new savings account should be opened. 
Although I had decided my duty gear timed in the quiet late afternoon in my trunk JP Morgan Chase branch to lay, were already about 20 people queuing. 
Not to the cash counters to collect money off or scheme, but on the customer service counter where customers check books, tourists after the way to Macy's department store and ask where new customers open accounts. 
Most front of me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employees with license", were from the same reason as I snake. 
Unlike me, however, they had already expressed their savings from smaller banks aloof, in places from where they pendelten as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Iceland. 
They had money from so-called Thrift (a bit of a building resembling), cooperative banks and that local savings banks that are only in a state branches have aloof and say that they treat customers like family. 
In the past year are 15 of these banks quietly gone bust. 
In the last few days was Washington Mutual, a bank with assets totaling $ 327 billion in bankruptcy administration last Friday and as New Yorkers over the weekend drove home, was Wachovia, another bank, the savings worth $ 440 billion has to find a buyer saving. 
In fear of further collapse, brought the office and shop employees before me decency Bares her to a bank as a safe haven is being viewed a bank for most Rettungsaufkäufe on Wall Street is responsible. 
Ordinary New Yorkers have in recent weeks running financial Latin appropriated. 
A woman who in my supermarket telephoned Chinese strain, took so much familiarity with respect to Lehman Brothers, the bank gone bankrupt and their emaciated-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as they would on a lazy fellow blaspheme. 
And Lyn, around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge in my apartment is from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina, and my food supply Bloc. 
"I now have all my savings into money market funds" they told me after my visit to the bank. 
"I've changed, I go no more a risk." 
Muslemische graves desecrated during slip right in Austria 
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing of the Austrian right Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Pertei right Vlaams Belang, take on Thursday, the 17th January 2008, at a demonstration in Antwerp in part to the organization "Cities against Islamization" to represent. 
They bear labels in the style of traffic on a mosque depicted is crossed out with a red line. 
The police accused the rightwing grave desecration at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend in the ultra-right party significant gains in parliamentary elections in the country reported. 
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in one, according to police, organized action seriously damaged. 
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but officials believe this crime to a trial, the subject of hatred of Muslim immigrants driven extremists to hide. 
It is not clear whether the incident in any way in connection with the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" about the message of grave desecration, which took place when the Muslim religious month of Ramadan an end. 
At the same time in Austria a round of research on conscience, after the country in yesterday's parliamentary election, slid to the right. 
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right parties addressed the nearly 30% of the votes received, sat in her campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their verdicts were electoral opponents criticized as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, the 18% of votes won, sat down for a ban on headscarves and burkas, and even made his dislike of foods known to be universally compatible with Islam in connection brings. 
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam. 
Both parties want the building of mosques and minarets with the ban argument that these symbols of a continuous political Islamization of Austria and Europe were. 
Polls and analysis, immediately after the election has been carried out and say that the extreme right of the strongest political bloc in the country are, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union make.

Judge Glitter shot a six-month ban on him after he checked informed authorities that he wanted France to Spain via travel. 
Police in Kent, it was granted last Thursday, a trip to impose lock, after the judges evidence of criminal Glitter because of the sexual abuse of children presented.

`I receive the master behind the stage to perform his character noted, Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No heels, no frill, no costumes for the performance. 
The nature of the great flamenco dancer, on the concentration and refrain from interpreting devote itself to a relaxed appearance as a woman or a man to get. 
One artist 
Other personality 
I look at life inside, in these moments that the audience are alien, I know when I am on the personality characteristic gesture, the depth of a stolen or Ausdrückstärke gaze of the hands, which are worried because they do not enter the stage will can be found. 
In his project `flamenco-people ', the German photographer Günter Bauer abwechselungsreiche theatricality of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists dar. From this page, he was responsible for the little-known artists. 
With this proposal creates a special photographer of the iconography of flamenco representation at different levels. 
The exhibition, the program of the Month of Photography is one of flamenco, `reflects the international importance of flamenco, from day to day becomes bigger, resist ', says the artist and makes clear that` flamenco-people' `any Humans can be, but if you look at the photos appeared, so the viewer observes that there is no typical pictures of artists on stage are. 
Ordinary people on the portraits are artists who are in a position to stage passion, sadness, joy to mediate and make the audience move. 
To the personality of these artists adhere to, you have no pictures on the stage make. 
Her personality and her character is in their hearts. 
What interested me was a personal atmosphere, which would allow me, with the camera the characters of the greatest flamenco master noted. 
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made in 1997 on a long journey to singer, guitarist or dancer with a digital camera to photograph. 
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, created images, which recall classic photography. 
The application of different style classical means destroying the basis of the image, making the image of modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands flamenco, will be: `music with traditional roots, which changed every day and surprised '. 
These are not just dancing, singing the instrumental or the game itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, with his art seduces the audience. 
The search for the essence, after a certain something, which is in the form of listening, of being visible, is and was the target of this work, the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata presented. 
Known personalities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of nearly seventy artists, who were photographed. 
The project was an anthology of flamenco and will soon as a book with all the portraits from the exhibition will appear. 
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to this idea two years ago still up and times than `portraits of the veterans of the sport 'to achieve (Sports` project'). 
Although the concepts of the project `flamenco-people 'are different, so are the photographer to` I like it very much to the people photographing them and getting to know me in their life state, whether for a brief moment, or a longer Time. 
I think that in the area of the portrait photography class is the most difficult. 
You hit yourself or encounters people, personalities, you sometimes do not know, or they leave you for a few minutes alone to take a photo of doing anything. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try my ideas into reality. " 
The collection of portraits of flamenco today with the title `flamenco-people 'is in the gallery of the El Fotómata issued, in the street with the name of la calle de la Mata, and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules runs. The exhibition allows you to 16 October visit.

Yesterday, during his attendance at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, was the preferred Nobel laureate, that the project, with which he employs a `Recklessness' and` everything is pointed out that the novel he would not write '.

Within four days, he has hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and seen thousands of people who were in Segovia.

Their dance foundations have given me much help in flamenco.

Their dance was sensual and me has been said that my dance aesthetic in this area lies', they claimed.

The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta Recién Casado 'includes the triennium a

The United States may be without Paul Newman badly imagine 
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of them. " 
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, with its reporter in `Sensation 'cooperated, and the then prevailing notion of U.S. Cinemas, which was left in the lurch, from throughout the Americas until Newman, with its exciting idea came and it was followed. 
Show times now, what it cost him the Oscar to lend. 
And when he retired in 2007. 
And he knew that he was very ill. 
Nevertheless it was a great shock for everybody. 
`What one sometimes feels, is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend, 'said Robert Redford crying,` my life and my country were the biggest of his life funny. " 
Nobody was afraid neither is ridiculous to even exaggerating. 
As `Father 'of the cinema and father of the country he is in a sad moment died in the fear of terrorists and before the market collapse prevails, in which the depression self-esteem of Americans on the desperate search for reasons to back dignity is. 
If this hard time without virtue only a few people who admire you can stay, so you do not necessarily Luis Cernuda, to Paul Newman to love. 
For all he embodied something of a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and various losses suffered as both also gains from the Foundation, dedicated to the fight against drugs prescribed, and in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of accidental overdose, was set up to the own brand of homemade and organic products. 
All this is a gift to the country in which it cost him a lot of trouble, against a deadly food culture enforce. 
A wide wave of surprise proposes house high above Hollywood without regard to nationality and citizenship to take. 
The latest James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winners, said that working with Newman, no more or no less than the peak of his career was. 
Russell Crowe, the bad boy, from Australia was ventured, Newman as his biggest inspiration to call. 
`We have the greatest of all of us to leave ', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare today to try to live like Paul Newman lived: high standards of righteousness to get a responsible life, far away from the cameras lead. 
That is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle. 
But there is someone who tries it, and Paul Newman was one example. 
He was once a distinguished and was then fifty years with Joanne Woodward married, he was loyal, although there are certainly many ways, there was not to be. 
`Why should I get a hamburger on the street to eat, if I had fillet at home? ', He often joked itself 
In heaven he is proud that on Earth, his daughters have the same opinion as his fans have what in America is not necessarily normal. 
`Of all the major roles, he played on, he was not so proud as to the faithful spouses, loving father of Grandpa's attentive and the philanthropists', they say. 
For the Olympic Games are the streets in Madrid flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympic disciplines in Madrid to organize, after the failure of 2012, but it can perhaps be 2016. 
But I wonder: `Are we prepared for that?" 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true! 
She was described as the perfect road, and according to my assessment, it was the worst street with all the trimmings, which it existed. 
This is naturally a lot of nonsense, if you consider the assessment would examine it and I could be so clearly not what durchgekommen. 
But, we go from the beginning through everything. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket to get which allows you to be the first to go. 
It seems to me not too bad, but if they approach you already have, then they should give you everything (including chip to the congestion on the roads to avoid). 
So do not. 
Here they let you get just the ticket (the first nonsense, is the only reason to go there) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt, there was only the size of `S '(a second nonsense, because I need the size XL) 
Where we actually live? 
Or is it that after the crisis was decided only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric to buy? 
Well, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that we must go very early in order to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, you need to backpacks leave. 
The wait longer than 35 minutes, which in the case of a street, where 11 000 people expected to be incomprehensible. 
Finally, as was expected, caught the road and we had our back sacks did not leave, even if it had succeeded once, but they would have been difficult to retrieve. 
Also saw it, in those 40 minutes after waiting out the rain, so it came to the temptation of a popular uprising and to organize the house to fall. 
I think tomorrow will certainly be some 500 people have pneumonia, and some like me because of this chip, which I have received, not even time to appear in the classification, I can already feel that the original was stamped incorrectly. 
Obviously, if I am a perfect street would ask me this road would never invade. 
I think we are still far from a dream city, which for the Olympic Games is well prepared 
Microsoft on the lookout for one (virtual) receptionist 
On the `Emerging Technology Conference, organized by MIT, Microsoft has the progress of the new image recognition system and the human-interaction presented a creature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but which is capable of some primitive tasks, such as a Taxi ordering (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route to get on the campus of the company to move). The system attends to what it hears during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a shape and facial recognition system, it can `receptionist 'to see how many people in the room are who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and the key words to understand their entertainment. 
It may also present after the talks in the lane groups. 
In the video presentation noticed the receptionist ` 'a third person, but she understands that this person in the group with the conversation with her lead, not to belong, and that no company employee is. 
She asks whether the person here who wants to visit and replied that they soon will listen. 
All without the blue screen shot 
Impressive 
That is certainly the future. 
Now the company has better things to which it can concentrate, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system. 
This week we talked about the very superficial change of strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not so many embedded applications. 
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer with the necessary equipment would instead with the commercial garbage to fill, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, it will only be for the few. 
Everything is just a finding, if one considers that Microsoft Windows versions of one or another function and `extras' inflicted. 
The change of direction is worthwhile 
Microsoft has the right to the operating system gradually loses in importance, just like the software. 
As a Google chromium appeared on the network, was a part of the theory that it is the first step by Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Many had cleverly pointed out that the browser is not operating. 
The operating system as an indispensable part, will always be necessary, so that hardware and software can function simultaneously. 
The operating system fulfills the role, function with his wife or his spouse can be compared when it comes to tell his mother anything. 
That's true. 
The system will never disappear, but you must be connected to his `death ', not as an absolute but as relative truth, think. 
What Ballmer this week said, is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give less attention each time the operating system, but more the Web browser. 
The computer will only start to Firefox, Explorer or the chrome and execute every day we spend more time surfing than in the vicinity of the `window '. 
What is the half of existing applications in the computer? 
Less is more 
And Windows compact 7 Must be much more compact than Vista. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's more there is to its online services to integrate, then, finally, the alternative may be to Google. 
In reality they need, without a doubt. I bring a small example. 
The photo of this place I have in Redmond, in a recreation room for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month made. 
On the soft drink machine is a sign attached: `Your Search. Our future '. It prints a request from its own tool for online search to use. 
In 2006 came an independent study concludes that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google searches for the network used. 
Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in the delay is advised. 
It will not start, but the end of 2009 appear even more likely 2010. 
Microsoft is looking at the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously in the market to bring. 
Every day turns the phone into a computer. 
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. 
Marcel Le Fabuleux 
Pablo Picasso has been in Costa Azul angehabt, Leonardo di Caprio had that mark in `Blood Diamond 'by Edward Zwick to, just like Al Pacino in` The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to a well-constructed garment priest. 
If we start the countless stars appearances list, so we can return to the picture of a very strong man, with a pointed beard fall back, in a traveling circus had lifted heavy weights. 
In fact, this is a typical male T-shirt made from cotton, sleeveless and fitted. 
The English call it `tank '. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands. 
First, because of his great name, although they are close circle Marcel ` 'is mentioned. The legend tells that the emergence of names associated with sport and the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the fans of the singer Edith Piaf, born. 
`La Marcel 'above all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) from which these T-shirts as a detail on the neckline have. 
And respect, the Belgian company focuses not only on production of `tanks'. 
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts ... 
Modeled comfortable and underclothing. 
Although it is very unfortunate, as they Untergarments to use. 
They are very attractive.

Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, is not it? 
I think yes, but, finally, take everything into one and these areas have many similarities. 
Since I was small, I was thrilled by the clothes, I always wanted to go to my grandmother in order to clothing closets herumzuwühlen my aunt and her clothes to be seen. 
That was great, almost better than in an amusement park to go. 
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to wear them. 
You know yes, we dancers like it so much, our own style in teaching and in the samples have to look into the mirror to ourselves and to feel good. 
As an actress, if you get the costume, puts you in the real actor role. 
Finally, everything is connected, there is so much respect for the costume designers and their professionalism. 
Recently art du 30 has become, you're not in crisis, in ruins? 
Oh what. 
I feel better than ever, than thirty years, I feel good. 
I think the woman is ripe, has experience and life can enjoy with fewer errors. 
I am not afraid for my biological clock. 
I've done the things that I have since I was small, wanted to make and gave me a lot of inner joy. 
So, do you think that, mother to be, or not? 
For a long time already, I know that I will mother, because my body requires, and also I want a young mother, which I do not want to miss. 
What the candidate concerned, because I do not worry. 
I will, my child feel great happiness and convey it with much love upbringing. 
As for the cinematography, it keep you in the eye, work on which you have participated and were shot last year. 
Exactly is it and I would like very much that they will be presented to the public.

To the women in the Third World to support what is also needed.

According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol has been shown to return to duty continued. 
The `alcolock 'would prevent it because it is a system affiliated with the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air, and prevented car start if the driver has alcohol test, or if an alcohol concentration is detected, which is higher than is allowed. 
It costs more than 1 000 euro, the costs are borne by the person, the penalty. 
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has been shown that these devices equipped cars in the first year after its introduction to 65% of rule violations prevented. 
In Spain, reckoned that each year 115 lives could be saved.

There is not 1000, but a possibility of more to us rapid chaotic everyday lives to forget. 
And if there are even a few, are all collected in a book in which it stands as one comes to relax. The book comes in the bookstores on 30 September. 
The alarm clock is a penalty when he was 7 clock rings in the morning, but even worse, the idea back into the hectic pace, which is the current life demands reinzukommen. 
The bureau says the tension and the computer, one of the back pain. 
The stress is the evil of the 21st Century. 
But there is not one, not two methods to the daily exhaustion and the problems of how to work the stops to fight. 
The number is rising, however, nothing more and nothing less than to to 1001. 
Besides yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, is Susannah Marriott in the book the whole list of possibilities that the taste and the time each adapted to dar. 
That works against the stress is `1001 options to relax 'and then the rest, which gives the book in the bookstores by the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
Who says that it is impossible to sleep in areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts to reach, so this guide refuted such faith. 
Moreover, the methods are offered, how in touch with nature, or the 100% natural recipes, which lead to relaxation. 
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer hochsteigt to balance the body recover and the stress has become a problem, so the time has come to sit on the sofa, the brain off and focus on reading to concentrate. 
In sleep talking 
Some children speak at night 
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something of what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep. 
If you are for the first time happens in the best case you will be shocked, but in reality has no meaning. 
This is a positive sleep disturbance, the talk in his sleep is called. 
It is fairly widespread, especially among children and adolescents. 
Surely, it was more than one of you says that you have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, such as during the high fever) or regular (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child can remember nothing. 
There is no single reason that caused this phenomenon. 
Often relationships with other appearances in his sleep looking like nightmares, night terror, noctura enuresis (bed wetting at night), speaking in his sleep wanted, but there is no reason for it. 
As we have mentioned previously, it may be very high in fiber, stress situations or are overtaxed. 
In any case, this is a little phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is highly variable. 
It may be that we quietly speaks in single words, whispers or it can totally be part of a counter (screaming, crying, long discussions ...). 
In the cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child is to observe and at a specialist advice to check whether a problem exists, which causes fear and in this way comes. 
We have said that there is a positive disorder, so it will not be dealt with, whether it is with another sleep disorder, which can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with the stress). 
What you can do is to develop a series of simple prevention measures: 
Try the baby before sleep is not to excite. 
So quiet game for the child to choose stressful and television programs avoid the terrible and something to be wild. 
For nervous children, which recommended relaxing, relaxation techniques can be applied to help them, a certain inner peace to get. 
This helps the child to sleep calmly. 
When talking in his sleep once, trying to preserve the peace. 
Remember that for the child is harmless and the next day there will be nothing to remember what happened. 
Useful advice 
Wake is not on. 
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will be sweep from sleep. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests off. 
Remember, if it is after a couple of appearances frightened shows, it is recommended to advise or to find out what the reason for the child afraid. 
If they understand what it says (which is usually not so), sets the child is not under pressure to carry out questioning and more information out. 
To ensure that you will achieve nothing, because if the child is asleep, it is unconscious and not think it can. 
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming, and why it says, so they were careful with the interpretation of the information and conclusions, it pulls out. 
Perhaps, says it is not the child that night to hear her and know its secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
That caused much anxiety. 
So, does not worry you, it's nothing bad, this is a moment that only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern ... finally 
After a long dry spell is Illhaeusern on the pitch finally back on course for success. 
Without much effort erspielten the yellow-black numerous Torchancen and made it an implement like this, and so the game to win. 
The pace of this encounter, in which the attacker had trouble, to show their skills, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the host captain Kauffmann, whose angle on rangestrike just passed, should Illhaeusern easily dominate the game, and it succeeded only Fonderflick alternately with a rangestrike, then the brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the toes, the defense Denmark's challenge. 
The opposing team blocks in the middle of the field and had only the lively Riahi at the helm through the storm. 
The start of the second half should be decisive with the first two by Riahi and Temporal Torchancen won, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Illhaeusern by Marais, which was exactly right to adopt a ball again, in a first attempt by Diebold off was. 
But the goalscorer Illhaeusern his luck should not be able to enjoy long and about twelve minutes later sent to the bank, making his teammates numerically inferior had to continue playing. 
Denmark, however, did not exploit it and put elf a Illhaeusern no major problems, including those just a few retired to their defense to `condense ', except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball after a big jumble very close to the latte passed.

Obama himself stressed that he represents the future. 
He spoke briefly and precisely, without getting off balance it. 
He moved his ability in the foreground, good decisions and the image that the world of the United States has to be renewed. 
`McCain has still not understood, however, Obama already ', continued this weekend, a democratic election advertisement on the other hand, in which Republicans accused was not the full extent of the crisis to have captured, based on the` Americans from the street' burden.

He did not even mentioned the words `middle class' or` workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, the Americans hold most appropriate for the economy even at the edge of the abyss to save a clear advantage.

For the democratic candidates is the current `crisis, the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policies, implemented by George Bush and Senator McCain has been '.

`Have you noticed that in Minsk in an election held?" 
Adolescents and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital, in advance to the results of parliamentary elections rejected.

Some admit that they did not even have chosen: `What's the use if they do anyway with my voice do what they want ', says a youth. 
They do not believe that the regime, which foreign observers in the best light shows to begin negotiations with the European Union to resume, is ready to do so, turning a democratic transition. 
The sanctions, including the Nichterteilen visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the Aufeislegen certain assets, could be lifted if these elections by observers as clean would be evaluated. 
According to the opposition, they were not. 
`We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the enumeration ', regretted Yuri Potemkin, spokesman of the union of democratic forces, a diverse concentration of twelve political parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who the auszählt vote, and for us it is the executive branch. 
If Members of the opposition in Parliament revoke it was because they were appointed, not elected. 
But you can feed into parliament broadcast on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals mean. ' 
The opposition is so guilty, is involved in the political game, because `the dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, which heavily indebted to Russia is in a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of a protectorate of Russia to be. 
Well, we want to be independent '. 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Wahlhergang has followed the election does not recognize as valid. 
She stressed that the turnout figures seem high, and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of voters from Minsk) to pave the way for any kind of manipulation has been paved. 
`Have you noticed that an election has taken place? Asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners, in August this year have been released.

And there are a maximum of five deputies of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who are closest to the ideas of the Government of date. ' 
The silence of the night descends again on the October Square. 
On television congratulate President Lukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission on their success. 
Interview - From the blood that was safe again 
Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th Anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to look, because Hema-Quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
And above all, it has the public's confidence recovered, by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s had been severely shaken. 
As you know, the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross national blood-managed reserves during the 1980s with the HIV virus and the hepatitis C virus contaminated. 
Given this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace KREV led investigation, the aim was to clarify the circumstances to bring to such a tragedy had led, and Directives To a new disaster of this kind of behavior. 
While judges KREV still hesitated, Available his report, presented at a committee several provinces on the legs, whose aim was to create a new system for the management of blood preserved in Canada to develop. 
In Quebec, the committee met Gélineau this contract. 
According to reports from Gélineau and KREV were in Canada two blood banks founded: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, Canadian Blood and the society to the other provinces and territories of the two circuits. 
`1998, when Hema-Quebec has begun its work, had barely 38% of people trust in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary. 
The situation was disheartening. 
Through the tremendous efforts made to the safety of the blood to improve and by working in this area during the following years, we have the public's confidence back ', she says, before she proudly points out that the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec Confidence in Hema-Quebec had. 
Dr. Décary reserves, however, aware that something `confidence is extremely fragile '. 
Since its inception on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec act in accordance with the principle of prudence. 
At this time we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman, which since its founding in 1998 the line holds. 
`And we have not had the slightest idea whether this disease through the blood could be transferred. 
So we "made us one of the main guidelines of the reports of KREV and Gélineau, according to the exclusion measures apply if you do not know if a disease progresses slowly, as is evident in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the case, the by a degeneration of the brain expresses, which inevitably leads to death. 
So we took in April 1999, no blood of persons who since 1980, longer than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. 
Well, a few years ago was without any doubt, proved that this disease through the blood is transferred. 
To us this incident has shown that the principle of prudence that we applied, certainly has a meaning. 
In 1999 the market a much more accurate techniques for detection of HIV: The nucleic acid test (NST), which allow direct in the blood of the donor, the presence of the virus itself prove, and not the antibodies against the virus, such as The tests used previously was the case. 
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period, between the date on which the person has been infected and, when the first viruses through our proven techniques in the blood can be held, said the specialist. 
This period was a period of less than a week reduced. 
It was a risk that some donors may be infected without knowing it, and we do not recognize could be reduced significantly. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion to be transferred to a considerable extent, be reduced. 
Today is one of 12 million people risk, with HIV infected blood to preserve. 
`In other words, that 12 million would have to distribute blood before someone would be infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec each year from 400,000 to 500,000 blood distributed, it would be more than 24 years before a case occurs when the HIV through a blood canned has been transferred. 
I think that we probably feel now, if you get a transfusion or prescribes to restore health ', says head of the Directorate of Hema-Quebec. 
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to improve the safety of our products. 
You never know what pathogens can get into the system. 
Only last year on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus emerged that, just like the West virus by insects on the blood is transferred. 
We must continuously monitor ', continues Dr. Décary continue before they stressed that Hema-Quebec alongside a secure supply also a sufficient supply to make available. 
`The demand is rising because the population is aging. 
Since the treatments to combat cancer are aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of blood donations for residents of Quebec are appropriate. ' 
It can be a healthy man, 18 years or older and suitability criteria are met, every 56 days, so six times a year, donate blood. 
On average, 14% of the people, their blood available, not because they, for example, AIDS or malaria are ill, and who traveled to a country is, where malaria is widespread, is for one year from blood donations excluded. 
`With these 3%, we create it, to obtain an inventory of the needs of the hospitals represents. 
Lack of supplies are very rare. 
But we must be members of this donor network renewed if they are older and no longer donate blood. 
It is difficult for people to convince, to donate blood, but above all to keep and to encourage them to bring regular donors to be. 
The life today is so hectic that one rarely finds the time, an hour when blood donations to spend ', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million U.S. dollars Hema-Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, skin and eyeballs, which are almost exclusively for serious violations of fire is used. 
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they Hema-Quebec is temporarily stored, including the only public cord blood bank manages Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, previously thought to be biomedical waste, is located in rich blood stem cells, which can serve serious diseases such as leukemia, to treat. 
`A few weeks ago we celebrated our thousandth of the storage cord blood sample, and we plan to more than a thousand stations. 
`We should probably early next year to begin, it transplants to make available ', explains Dr. Décary continue the program of cord blood loss describes as very popular. 
`Many mothers are convinced not have access to ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to this complex and costly program in all hospitals to offer Quebec.

Charest opts for the north 
The Prime Minister does not rule out before the end of year elections procedure. 
Once the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was finished, went to Jean Charest yesterday after Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to part in today's election to be elected. 
`The course of our last great frontier in the north move ': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest yesterday with visual resources in the General Assembly of the Liberal Party in Quebec Levis presented, but he has followed the guidelines ..

To the press refused to accept the Prime Minister, incidentally, ruled out that he hold elections this autumn, even if he had stated that his diary was very full. 
The North `plan 'is the fourth element of a` vision', the Prime Minister, allegedly for Quebec, namely that of a `new economy 'that an agreement with France regarding workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario provides. 
Although in recent times often in the speeches of the Prime Minister said, was the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49sten latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister was limited however to explain why the North `a jewel with enormous potential 'was called but no date, no investment amounts or precise priorities for the coming projects. 
Not more than a few views on what more could be worked: Especially at the water energy, the forest, but especially on the mining sector, benefiting from the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure. 
The bullets that Mr. Charest holds the north `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'. 
"This area twice as large as France '` is in our vicinity, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how in order to show that he founded a national dream come true investigated. 
Quebec is through his connection with the North grown, he said: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebec, the James Bay. 
`It belongs to us, it is our future ', he added, after a theatrical pause, he had brought to the giant map behind them. 
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador with that Quebec has always einforderte, said the prime minister against the press. 
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued. 
There is a boundary line, where it has been a very long time no agreement exists when the opportunity I will be this attitude on behalf of the Government taking back ', he said. 
Furthermore, `with climate change we must make our vision of the North rethink 'he said and talked about the Northwest Passage as a result of melting ice the whole year will be passable. 
In this new geopolitical context of the Prime Minister said that it was almost an obligation, to occupy this area. 
And the inhabitants of the area, the Aboriginal and Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec very careful with them would, and that this project would benefit, especially the boys. 
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (pekistischer former member of Ungava) have already been in discussions about thirty Communities. 
One of Benoît Pelletier led the Committee of Ministers, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and minerals) occupies an important place, the work commenced. 
The Prime Minister concludes a large assembly not, `not a summit, but an opportunity, when` we create a common vision is'. 
The development of the North is also in accordance with the principles of sustainable development take place. 
The plan is `North discussed, regulated and environmentally sound 'that he promised. 
Jean Charest described this `vision ', as if they were a continuation of those of the Liberal Prime Minister was, before he was in office. 
`How the Liberals, before we were in office, we have umgedacht to the challenges of new growth and Entwicklungschanchen to transform. 
This was also one of the issues repeatedly raised the weekend, which on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage has been opened. 
One of the decisions adopted, provides the power of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout Dam rename. 
`From Godbout, of Hydro-Quebec has created over Lesage, the silent revolution and Nationalization of the water electricity has reached to Bourassa, the James Bay has always knew our party, to determine the future ', said Jean Charest. 
The press took it over to another, this conservative project reference, namely the `Roads to the North 'by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
With regard to the hydroelectric dam project Eastmain1a-ruper, Mr. Charest emphasized that its commissioning is planned for 2012. 
`The remains among us, but I did before, but to be ', he trusted his party members on what those storms caused applause. 
The Prime Minister, who in April said that in 2008, and certainly 2009, no elections would in fact has the opportunity this fall to hold an election, which by law since it is still not excluded. 
He stressed that his diary is full, however, mainly because of a Gemeinschaftsrats Mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The General Assembly of the weekend gave the liberal party leader a platform from nationalist plans, especially from the Constitution `concerned goals, which were readily adopted: The PLQ calls especially the recognition of Quebec` feature 'in the Constitution. 
It also wants Quebec members of the Council of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications appoint, and that such a veto regarding the decisions in Quebec possess. 
From the side of the opposition were the guidelines of the plan with skepticism to the North. 
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has the policy to develop the North-du-Quebec hervorgeholt again, the government has Landry in 2001. 
According to her, the Liberal government, as in 2003 came to power, refrained these apply. 
If they had done it, `if we were already much further, Ms. Marois ruled on the side of their candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has advocated the adoption of a plan by the northern government support. 
`But what we want is that this is not only a great idea is', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx deputizing for Mario Dumont, now back from holiday comes. 
Letters - A country dishonored 
Mr. Vic Toews,'Justiz' ex-minister (what irony) in the Cabinet, it was Harper, who last summer allowed, Louise Arbor on to say that she was a `disgrace 'for Canada. 
This woman, a never-ending struggle for justice has led and all deserve our admiration, then cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister around, how about Stephen Parker himself 
We are dealing here with a government to do, the only all of the countries concerned in their concentration camps of Guantanamo prisoners are not native has brought home. 
A government which does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager, when things happened to him be criticized. 
The only government which, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention has breaking their word and a child soldier under inhuman conditions can vegetate. 
The only one that is a parody of justice herablässt to the guilt of the accused to assess. 
Call us remember that, especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers to plead, Omar Khadr home to fetch so he in Canada gets a fair trial. 
Exactly this government also closed its eyes to torture: There they are interested in little that a young adult, after so many years of torment certainly psychologically broken for ever will be. 
We are not yet aware of, but we are seeing here just an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our `democracy ', this word, the Harper constantly like a flag in front of her bears, and from his mouth as meaningless sounds. 
It is therefore the time has come where there is no morality anymore: You may use a Canadian citizen arbitrary abuse, torture and lock up, according to a government leaders discretion, to date only a minority supports it (may he after the October 14 quite belong to minority ...). 
Many voters believe that their salvation at a party to find the virtue, law and order preaches. But they do not see that this government is different from the losgesagt, which is the reputation and dignity of our country respectively. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else. 
Freedom of expression - The orwellsche speech by Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 Le Devoir in September a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Assistant Director-General of Canada's Barrick Gold mine gold. 
This confirmed and pursued a orwellsche logic that the largest gold mining company in the world, a libel action over six million against three authors and a small publishing house without resources aspired, with the goal of a `transparent public debate 'to open. 
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, then they do not have to judge the truth, especially in the case of defamation lawsuits, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was made by Mr. Garver totally ignored. 
Because for Barrick Gold is the best way to a public debate, everyone in the ruin to drive, the dares, one of their opposing views to represent. 
No matter how the process runs out, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight, from the pockets of the almost inexhaustible gold mine to be paid . 
The tactics in this unequal battle is also often the defenders to ruin a friendly regime in order to force the opposite side silenced and also makes every deter dares to revisit the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they would have their view of things in front of public opinion must be present. 
Contrary to what many of the countries in which Barrick Gold operates, and there is access, are in Canada debates usually through the exchange of ideas and not by truncheon blows out. 
It would therefore suffice if the goldmine their books and records and disclosed a real debate had opened, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent auditing, which shed light on this question would bring. 
But Barrick Gold appears no confidence in the public opinion and whisks the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand motion aside. 
Could perhaps explain Mr. Garver, as he simultaneously to a `public 'debate may ask and yet the views of these public disregard? 
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice President only generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians, a pretty narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy itself slanderers have the right to speak. 
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or will not understand - is that the public, the authors and publisher of Canada supports Noir, it does so mainly because they are the brutal attitude of gold declines. 
These public is ready to listen and to Barrick judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame, as many perceive Gag-action (during the `public debate 'Barrick Gold currently has an exposure to The authors of Noir Canada addressed in which they demanded of them, this concept no longer use ...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the plea from Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, which is essential for any democratic society. 
They completely deny the right to quote from credible sources and facts and interpretations to discuss the basis of intellectual work. 
If it works in a country like Canada is impossible, themes to explore and discuss the range of companies in this world do not like who else can do? 
If Barrick Gold really a public and transparent debate wanted, they could lead by the scientific standards followed by the authors of Noir Canada were used. 
She has a right to respond. 
The university environment to which we belong, has long, debates and disagreements to grips with and conflicts to resolve. 
The disproportionate action by Barrick Gold shows clearly that, in contrast to what she pretends not to want to have a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time that governments take measures to this type of unjustified actions limit. 
Rescue operation for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans are 
The Bush administration and senior Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, yesterday finally came to an agreement on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.

The negotiations had during the last two hours accelerates, for fear of the effect that a further failure on the mood of investors would have received. 
The deadline, which had been agreed, was the market opening this morning. 
The two American presidential candidates who are late in the negotiations involved, were more likely than supporters of the agreement, but without fail, their dissatisfaction about to express that they are extreme on this way should take. 
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions on the agreement, especially those who are the owners allow their houses to keep and those related to the salaries of senior executives of state enterprises rescued. 
`If the taxpayer requests it because of the irresponsibility of certain people to take extraordinary measures, it is not what you could congratulate itself. 
But these measures are necessary ', he said on American television stations. 
When he was on another channel was asked whether he proposed the plan will be voting, said his Republican opponent John McCain: `I would only like to know the details, but I hope so. 
`The principles that I have read, [indicate] that this is a matter which we will all have to digest, and with which we are ahead. 
The option, even doing nothing is simply not acceptable ', he said. 
The 700 billion U.S. dollars plan is designed with the taxpayers' money 
It comes 14 months after a crisis, the bursting of a housing bubble triggered the first collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) led before they apply to other forms of common bonds expanded (PCAA), and finally into a freezing of financial and in the Ruin of banks and financial institutions led. 
A group of Republican deputy, it was that last week the first attempt on the agreement could fail. 
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic 'assets of companies in distress only backed by the government and not be bought, they believe the impasse escape. 
To view all off in Congress, has also added an injunction that says that if the government with this program within five years of losses should make, then they could collect new taxes, so their invested capital back. 
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion prior to the additional 100 billion can be added, if the president considers it necessary. 
The payment of additional 350 billion must be renewed in a vote by Congress to be adopted. 
In return for his help Washington receives shares in the company supported to him in the case of dividends into profits, and sell it again, if the storm is pulled over. 
The federal government will have the possibility of seizure procedures regarding the apartments to the plan affected by this real estate loans are tied, reside, and also deadlines for repaying the severance payments and fixed to the executives of the companies concerned may be paid. 
The developers of the plan would be happy that the House of Representatives already voted on it, and then the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light. 
Indeed, yesterday raised more votes against this project, both sides of the Republicans and the Democrats. 
`Obviously we do not understand Washington ', said the Republicans Garett Scott, a member of the Finance Committee of the Chamber, its electorate. 
`Yes, we have a huge financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But no, which consists of the taxpayers to pay to ask '. 
The democratic deputies Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress, the `Kaukus of the skeptics' is called, makes things different, but at the same conclusion. 
`Four hundred excellent marketing professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: We ask the Congress, not under pressure and to carefully consider which path is' he said yesterday. 
At the same time, we got into Europe again demonstrated that it is a worldwide crisis. 
At an emergency meeting of the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion U.S. dollars) to. 
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would waive its rival kept that are in great difficulty, since it is 2 billion euros (2.9 billion U.S. Dollars) in the crisis through the risky real estate loans in the United States has lost. 
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is among the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
'That's not lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
To compensate, we receive a choice and influence in the bank. 
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate now as uncertain times announce. ' 
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British Government while watching another from the financial crisis in distress brought to nationalize bank.

Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon 
Its beauty with the blue eyes has long been his trump card, nobody would say his weakness. 
Had the American actor with the charming smile from the narcissistic mirror exempt? 
Yes and no. 
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have made him equally well from a position of power away, the truly terrible monster brings to the world. 
But what a great time runner! 
On Friday at the age of 83 years from the effects of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut late Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years. 
He was monumentally less than Brando, whom he resembled and for a long time, he kind of rival to the canvas was careful in his drama, but certainly also fragile, but as an apostle of freedom and blasting dramaturgical conventions. 
Miscellaneous blood is often wonderful children. 
It was founded in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a mother born ungarischstämmigen. 
From its European roots should be a glorious faces of the American dream arise. 
Without excessive ego, extreme quality. 
Because it reflected a whole country again, in the self-made man in love was the fighter in the Pacific war was wounded in battle at the beginning of the 50s art at Yale Acting studied and then the Actor's Studio in New York visited before he success at the theater, on television and in cinemas soon had. 
It is this man who for the civil rights struggle, was the driver in 1979 when 24-hour race of Mans Second, and also a sex symbol, although he and the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a flagship relationship lived. 
With him disappear and the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and against the glamor of show business überempfindlichen stars, whose mysteries we will never completely solved. 
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman returned to cinema lovers this weekend in frenzy, while on the dark screen of memories all his major roles were played. 
More than half a century of American cinema in constant change pulls him over. 
Since pushing back the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) into memory, and the young man, his sensual woman (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof rejects, 1958 by the Tennessee Williams filmed was. 
There will be a lot shorter back memories (1990) wachgerufen, on his sensitive Mr Bridge, in his high age of a wedding is disrupted, not all of their promises fulfilled. 
So many other Paul Newman was in the course of history. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me (A handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role which is intended for James Dean was after his death was resumed and the 1956 Newman correctly made known . 
This likeable thug in the outstanding The Sting (The trick), in 1973 with the Oscar for the best film award. 
As an embittered and vengeful billiards player in the marvelous The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), 
This face by the times through which he was. 
Still he said. 
In his biography unite eras. 
The youth knows him primarily from the cult movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the Orthodox coach a little hockey teams. 
His supporters found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy the Coen brothers again. 
With a recent role in 2003 as godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes joined the circle. 
Unlike several movie legends who are early enough in the film world have pulled back, Newman should remain long in the saddle, and Hollywood, his assets, his pomp and betrayed his concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the `Underworld Playing ', as his overly expressive performances evaluated. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, the roles long time the only way zuflogen. 
He played but less than outsiders Sunny Boys: neurotics, alcoholics, or Fieslinge Desperate, with their perfect his slide presentation he and his rebellion reflected. 
As a director Newman revealed his true unknown sides delicate sensibility. 
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the Canadian novelist Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, drew a full portrait of Mrs. subtle melancholy. 
He, his son Scott by an overdose lost, was dedicated in 1984 his film Harry and Son, a work full of subtlety and sadness. 
During the flood of tributes, which yesterday gushed over Newman, said his close friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they were together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid played) very taken: `His presence has been my life and this The country improves. " 
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential qualities of the late actor. 
Apart from his legendary career is now also a big advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinemas, an opponent of Hollywood's drift, then. 
We probably have it often with the feet in bowls full vinaigrette, in sauces, bread or other foods are seen, and this is kept fairly tasteless, although initially we were still funny. 
The profits from its sales still flowed into his foundation for children in need 
Instead of focusing on his myth to rest, Newman is committed to the shot. 
He left behind his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and up at the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was an honor to be able to be here. ' 
And for us it was an honor to the life of an intelligent and generous as the American actor to be able to pursue. 
A good citizen, in the closest and in the broadest sense. 
What has been produced in the factory invoice surcharge &amp; Co.? 
On 8 October to begin negotiations in the criminal charge against Janos and his accomplices. 
The accused is in particular the involvement in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent injury and business fraud and other criminal acts - including falsifying documents - accused. 
According to the prosecutor from the bidding process gained funds for his own purposes, while the services often with fake invoices were. 
State funds and grants from the government - a total of HUF 65 million - will be partly into the coffers of the Organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in private funds flowed to individual. 
As the investigating authorities announced were at the invitation obtain funds fictitious invoices, and the clubs will continue their duties even after his come. 
According to indictment, a large part of the accounts have been falsified. 
The bill blocks were on the market by Józsefváros bought, the circular seal was found in Kiskunhalas purposes. 
The decision as to which company the bills will be issued, it was on that trip around north of Lake decided on by the Lados István János award was sent. 
During this "discovery tour" should Lados guesthouses and restaurants discover. 
He called on the consumptions invoices for later templates based on these calculations for the Youth and Sports Ministry, the Social and Labor Ministry and the government of Budapest to be able to exhibit. 
These accounts should a majority of István Lados and his accomplices, András Ori have been manipulated, the latter according to our information for the constitution of the relevant reports had to be. 
One of the objectives of Lados' "reconnaissance trip" was a local beer. 
As two of the award and Co in 2003 issued invoices show that the catering operation is the neunzigköpfige group of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület have entertained. 
Now there but the chief of operations at such a large group at once would not in the local hineingepasst. 
Another statement, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as a együtt Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious form and content errors. 
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj with only three rooms available and no more than ten people can simultaneously accommodate, according to accounts 130 guests have stopped. 
The fantasy of the invoice counterfeiters were also apparently no limits when it comes to Pigal Ltd. fell, a catering operation, in its accounting of customer Jobb Jövőért Hoppa loud and prosecution does not even appear. 
As managing director of Farkas Győző hvg.hu announced it was immediately clear that this was falsified documents acted as him by the prosecutor during an interview documents were submitted. 
"Our company name and tax identification number were on the wrong stamp affixed." 
And further: Apart from procedural defects was also misspelled the fact that the operation of one hundred people have houses, after a total of eleven rooms that are impossible for so many people. 
Was also on the bill have been given food, but the restaurant had been a long time no longer in operation. 
The bill busy and even counterfeiters also have to verify that they targeted exclusively Budapest travel agency offering trips abroad, and so they Hungary trips to the cash accounts indicated what the practice of accounting firm also objected. 
As in the course of the investigation was announced, they have also cited the VAT invoices also cited, although travel benefits, linked to a country outside the EU relate VAT-free. 
The amount of VAT was a total of four from the hotel Révfülöp Kft to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért issued false invoices, since the operation instead of 25 Only 15 per cent VAT charged, also by the employees are exclusively mechanical invoices, the forged documents were handwritten . 
Another error that the "accounting" was undermined, was that in a case of "goods" as the service had, although this is the advice to investment firm specializing do not appear, shared with the prosecutor. 
Another form of errors - false invoice format, false stamps - was too owe that to a együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued as counterfeit bills could be unmasked. 
Similarly in the case of Bt Ravenna and the sports camps Kunfehértó whose CEO asserts, the bills have never issued. 
Another "mistake" is the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft from Nyíregyháza undermined: This company was at the time (2001) is currently in dissolution, as the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület have eaten there - the trustee was therefore to the bills do not even have to be issued. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they need to fictitious accounts. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation has Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, at a height of about 4 million HUF issued. 
According to the indictment, was managing director of the Collab Ltd., one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to the exhibition persuades the fictitious invoices. 
The moment also wound up BioGate Ltd. will also supplement and Co. have collaborated: In 2003, the Foundation Ltd. Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with fake invoices for a total of 5 million supplies HUF , which is not provided benefits. 
But there was also little payment because the bills immediately after they were canceled exhibition, which involve stakeholders in their documents but have forgotten it. 
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly linked to the accused to be associated. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman director of the Ukrainian trio of Delta Kft, a Budapest resident, but could not find fuel and vehicle trading company. 
This company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills relating to the sale of computer components with a total value of approximately HUF 18 million issued. 
According to investigative authority should have been the 14th September 2005 wound up cash from Kiskunhalas Investment Ltd. as a buyer of these acts have bills. 
CEO of this company was a Romanian, the company also documents of Iván Kubatov should be delivered, from 2002 to 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov has confessed during the investigation, invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the clubs and Atlasz Hoppa, as well as a együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány issued themselves and their equivalents collects it. 
The company Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and the Jos-investment should be of Bt Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs explicit desire to have been founded. 
In truth, however, none of these companies actively, which, according to Angeklagtem was a lack of orders. 
However, he could from the companies benefit: At the request of his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szentes, with the preparation of the company's founding documents was instructed, he, on behalf of the company's invoices to the charge associated Clubs issued, such as Atlasz and Y -Generáció. 
The overall aim Kubatov 15 bills with a total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the company's cash investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Linaxtrade investment and to the organizations have issued. 
The Prosecutor expects that Kubatov 10% of the total bill and value added tax collects might have. 
Kubatov even should the company Szi Beri-Bt for issuing fictitious bills have abused - in this case were the accounts of the applications Biztos Pont settled. 
The company Y Generáció and Szövetség a Magyarországért Modern in January 2006 have their applications for the nonprofit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ( "TMA") delivered. 
Both received per 500,000 forint, these amounts but used for another purpose. 
To do this hush, they have the TMA five fictitious accounts of the Works team presented Kft. 
Incidentally, these invoices were in search of the offices of Árpád Kemecsei Ministry ensured in the classroom. 
In the negotiations, now by some defendants with a confession about the way the bill forgery, as they have already stored before the public prosecutor were expected. 
Could be a sensation if the Hauptangeklagte János supplement to a comprehensive confession decides. 
His previous indications were that less detailed, and although he had already pledged several times, fully informed of everything to report his confession is still pending. 
So the question remains open whether it is in its interest is whether the Socialists a pact with him regarding the restitution of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have been completed, and whether award in return is ready to take responsibility. 
It is quite possible that the surcharge now "insulted" plays, after his requests to mitigate the detention and house arrest on deaf ears were. 
While other criminals, with far greater economic malpractice damage and these have not compensated, at large, or at least are under house arrest, remains surcharge denied this possibility. 
About the psychology of the bidding - or why we are prepared to pay more 
At the auction buyers tend to spend more and thus offered for sale to overestimate. 
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York is now succeeded in the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior to discover. 
According to the "Science" magazine published study that people want in a competition like an auction on eBay, not beaten, and are therefore willing, even to pay excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried to schedule the neurological this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. 
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others attended a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of subjects using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) investigated. 
In both games, participants could win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, losers in the auction measured in the bidding over the opponent plays a major role. 
Among many other functions, this brain region for the "self reward" of the nervous system responsible. 
The researchers believed, therefore, the price could be achieved by avoiding an over-reaction of the striatum explain. 
To her thesis to underpin the economists in the research group studies in addition to tracking the money employed. 
In this case, three groups against a partner under different conditions bid. 
The control group was the true value of the product indicated, then they have made their bets. 
Another group were also 15 U.S. dollars reward promised in the event that they are winners from the game show. 
The third group received 15 U.S. dollars before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups existed only so that the emphasis at the one on the gains, while the other was on the losing. 
As evidence for the hypothesis neurologists were expressed but the members of the "Losing against" playing group to higher operations prepared than those in the control or the "profit" group. 
"These results can be from any previous economic theory derived. 
These have the observed behavior in auctions only with the joy of winning, or the risk avoidance reasons. 
The contradiction between these two theories was due to neurological imaging methods dissolved, so we are now a third statement to have "- said Andrew gravel, a professor of economics faculty of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When is the doctor? 
Worldwide suffer from some half a billion people under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease among the leading causes of death listed. 
The number of people infected here is estimated at hundreds of thousands, however, be dealt with only seven thousand, what it is that patients often do not know they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the generic term for viruses triggered by various infectious liver disease. 
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are frequent, however, the differences between the pathogens and the diseases from each other. 
Depending on the pathogen spread the hepatitis virus in two different ways: for hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), for hepatitis B, C and D may be the virus through blood and other body fluids (such as semen, Vaginal secretions or saliva) transferred. 
Passengers will be a vaccination against the virus A and B in any case recommended against the virus C, there is no vaccine. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A show about two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally of Unwohlbefinden, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea accompanied. 
After the jaundice occurs on the skin and the eyes to the chair is bright, dark urine, and the convalescence may take up to two to three weeks time. 
Worldwide died around 1 million people in the hepatitis B triggered far more serious diseases like liver cancer and cirrhosis. 
The main reason for this is that only an estimated one in ten infected people in drug treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most people infected do not know about their illness decision, since the pathogen insidious liver cells destroyed - in many cases show the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
It is timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential. 
There are three groups where the disease occurs more frequently: those who before 1991 have undergone a blood transfusion, drug addicts, and tattooed. 
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide at 200 million. 
Since the disease was already at a routine laboratory examination verified, it is advisable at the first signs of unknown origin, the family reside. 
Detected, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus the risk of infection and the development of cancer is prevented. 
The 30th September is the World Day of hepatitis, 2004 for the first time representatives of patients around the world organized. 
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of these viruses caused by chronic inflammation of the liver, its origins and the importance of early detection to be strengthened. 
Believers have less pain? 
As the latest research results show that the religious faith as a kind of "painkiller" effect, which is already the death of Catholic martyrs makes it easier to provide. 
Oxford University scientists have conducted an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent the belief in God the pain of the people affected, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph". 
In the course of the investigation were rather bizarre, each with 12 electric shocks believers and atheists, while a painting of the Virgin Mary studied. 
As the results showed the believers were the bulk of the pain off. 
Using a brain scan technology could even be demonstrated that the Catholics part of their brain were activated, for the pain regulatory jurisdiction. 
The investigation was the first in a research project in which scientists also next to philosophers and theologians of various departments of the university participate. 
When the experiment was a sparkling volunteers connected to the left hand tied, which delivered electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to come heavily on two paintings to concentrate: First, an image of the Virgin Mary, painted by the 17th Sassoferrato Century, and secondly, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with an Ermine." 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful a kind of religious trance would rise, while da Vinci's image selected because it is scarcely different from the other paintings and was perceived as reassuring. 
The trial ever spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received during this period a total of 20 shocks in four stages, while they are either the religious or the other should see paintings. 
Catholics reported that they had at the sight of the Mother of God "in safety" felt as if they "cared" would be, and that they had "peace and tranquility" felt. 
During the viewing of religious painting, they have over 12% reported less pain than if they work Leonardo had in mind. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, said that similar effects could also be combined with other strong images even when limiting the atheist cause, you just have to find the photo. 
"We have to find a picture that is very positive feelings triggers, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist. 
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases," said Wright. 
According to these excellent results will remain only question is what effect the Madonna image of Leonardo or any other similar painter on the regulation of pain believers would. 
Would the quality Virgin Mary still better results? 
You are what you think about you 
To celebrate their tenth birthday, Google can rightly say: it is in the pockets of people just to see how over their heads in the sky: You know, where people have spent their holidays to which doctors they go and what they moves. 
And so that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of Google. 
In the direction of skeptics who Orwellschen of horror are plagued visions, he Align: This would be just the essence of Web 2.0 overlooked. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main goal of Google was to have more personal information about users to collect and so the original objective of the company closer to what they're "all information of this world order" wants. 
Schmidt said Google was after ten years of work weltverändernder still only at the beginning of information gathering. 
When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to questions like "What shall I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" to answer, but software programs were not yet able to because they are not enough about the user know. 
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of its Internet search keywords would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which was searched, and the pages visited. 
For example, two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allows visitors to its own search history to store and later to fall back, so much more precise hits later can be generated, and at the same logic based on the so-called "Recommendations", with which The system customized products and services based on the earlier preferences recommends. 
The users, however, wonder what in the event of a data abuse happened - "If you nachschaut what I do '- show some concern whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases, however, it is rather the firm represented, potential power, the frightening effects, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or rebellion against the power that many Internet users on Rejection triggers. 
However, it is a proven fact that the search not only saved, but in case the occasion also be given to third parties, and in these cases, laws, there is no protection for the personal rights of Internet users. 
A prime example was the recent action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the wake of Google's Brazilian government information presented by the community site called Orkut "were collected and also enabled the identification of pedophilia. 
Rights to personal users worried but still could breathe again in May, when Google jointly with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI went to court: Google may be in the future with any point of the Constitution be forced to provide information to the FBI for a secret inquiry surrendered. 
(However, the Federal Government has successfully passed the issuance of 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the years prior to Minors Act, adopted obtained, but it was the list of individual users, or whose Web and search list to retroactively deprived of two months.) 
Google's image remains so controversial: Those who dislike her personal data out, because the use of Google services, the loss of their private and intimate sphere of fear, whip the company itself with the conservative performing companies rightful indignation. 
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture", which in many countries and is enthusiastic computer fans, activists and unites users, the next generation of "cool operator" in them, unlike Microsoft, the market leader, thanks to Windows, even if both to the same objective fighting. 
One possible reason is that Google's users, as opposed to Microsoft has not demanded identification codes, and his services free of charge so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package far more attractive, young and seem to be cooler than the official Practices of the software giants. 
Geeks imply the other hand, the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor sharp - a relationship, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" at the center stage. 
When "Web 2.0" is in fact nothing more than to collaboration, say, the user deliberately left traces and use the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions are different individually, remains the same merits, namely to show publicly. 
An average young person may simultaneously on several community portals to manage his profile - from Facebook on Xanga, this means other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm combine, and all this can finally into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or blip. fm mount. Moreover, blogs can lead to the most recent photo galleries automatically, which on Flickr or Picasa are geostet. 
And a good number of other cases shows: When viewing the photos of the party last night soon finds out the girlfriend, with whom her unfaithful boyfriend amuses, or the employee is dismissed because he is in his blog just too honest his anger over the corporate air makes - one thing is sure: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted. 
Who is a leading online life, is what it is cheap there - it could be around the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth formulate. 
And who is trying to keep something secret, or even the Google monopoly to circumvent the like can do - such as Scroogle, a tool that on the Google search engine accesses, but intentionally leaves no traces. 
Not a few people deliberately do not register at the Community pages, so that they can not be found, but also the on-line applications from Google such as word-processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, you can bypass with alternative versions, which no huge server parks are bound and therefore also not the best profile of users generate. 
Public opinion, however, banned it waits until Google shows its true face. 
With its current value of $ 156 billion, the company even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the Advertising AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenues of Advertising agencies, and the ever faster services are introduced not only Microsoft but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical viewers can find, however, the opposite poles disquieting: for example, has led to a protest group of employees totally rejected the charges after the company's own kindergarten were doubled, also said the management, multiple meals for employees was too costly. This all seems quite mild but on the other hand, indicates that Google in 2006 before the Chinese government even went into the knee and with a consent agreement was that all regimes critical hits, or those who are against good taste violated, would be filtered out. 
The internal rules of the group reads, in advance that no new service is advertised, but only if those already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years back some meaningful upside: While some believe that Google's book and Magazinscan and archiving project will meanwhile proportions that the company soon with the Supreme Court would have to deal with, so are other much more because of the System "health" worried that the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and issues permits. 
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, delivers the next generation of sci-fi authors already the substance - such as "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best manner orwellschen a future in which a man thanks to Google nahbar related data is frightening. 
Two young people will help the double murderer of Ózd at the track removal 
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police interrogated now two teenagers who is suspected of, in removing traces of mitgeholfen to have informed the Speaker of the Police Commissioner Borsod on Tuesday. 
The youths were geständig, currently they are accused of aid. 
According to the news agency MTI are two girls who are at liberty to defend. 
Aid comes with a prison sentence of up to five years of imprisonment. 
The culprit of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man who was on Sunday remanded in custody. 
The man is under strong grounds for suspicion, of avarice deliberately murdered several people to have. 
During the investigation has revealed that the 23-year-old a 53-year-old a larger amount of money owed had. 
The suspects wanted his debts but do not settle, so he drew his creditors last Wednesday on a site in Ózd, where he and his nine-year-old daughter murdered. 
According to the MTI, the husband of the acts planned long hand - this demonstrates the fact that the murders he came on the scene with a hidden firearm offense. 
Together with experts investigated now Tatwaffe police and the circumstances of their use. 
Warsaw Stock Exchange sets bid for the Prague Stock Exchange 
Some 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of stock owned packages of the Prague Stock Exchange offered. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer, which Poland despite the fact that there were previously by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock were excluded. 
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state. 
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish government, however, more than 60% of the papers in the coming months, wants to sell. 
According to reports from the Czech newspaper "E15" includes the offer of Poland to the highest purchase price, depending on the Prague Stock Exchange was warranted. 
As the newspaper reports, have until now the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq TransAtlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse offers made. 
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that all those interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange probably the worst new owner would be closed and he can not exclude that in the future even to close the Prague Stock Exchange could lead. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns. 
According to the shareholders agreement could be 90% of the shares are sold. 
Largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceska Sporitelna bank, with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four Sarl with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers 
In her to the increasingly worsening international financial crisis, devoted to commentary on Tuesday said some leading European leaves already "second September 11." 
The global financial disaster, we have the American president to thank, said about "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to set up his own party for the bill to one behind, slightly alleviating the frightening situation should .. . 
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor" as the billions serious investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate, from a "second September 11" to speak. 
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the "El Mundo" is the lack of political leadership fault that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse is located. 
The American financial system increasingly threatens collapse, and including the whole world will suffer. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now threatened after the vote in Congress is a danger that Washington is not a political means of crisis management is ready. 
The global economy is in the air, and just at a time when one of the biggest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place. 
You can see the threat no longer ignore, says about the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger." 
While still some states could destabilize their precarious financial institutions rescue packages available, and banks with taxpayers' money to save before the bankruptcy. 
If, however, triggered a domino effect and more banks go bankrupt, then no further financial help syringes, or other emergency measures. 
Long term, the EU member states over their shadows and jump control over the money markets centralize. 
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion on Weak financial institutions disbursed, recalls the Vienna Der Standard. " Moreover, the newspaper continued, the concerns were always realistic that after the Americans now also the European taxpayers somewhat deeper into their pockets would have to emerge from the crisis. 
So far the EU has not seriously deal with the crisis, which looks like a tsunami about to sweep the old continent. 
The "savior" should not immediately with several hundred billion "waggle", but it would be advisable to note, in which case it would be sensible, taxpayers' money to handle, to an even greater damage. 
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumble bee 
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not the obstacle sensors from nature to imitate? 
For example, the bees. 
At CEATEC in Japan was an amazing project presented at the Nissan engineers of bumblebees in the creation of new accident avoidance systems were inspired. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo has the Nissan car biomimetic robots controlled system of the type BR23C built a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim to develop a system to support that avoids any collisions. 
In flight each bee makes its own oval "private sector", of our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development at the exhibition. 
The compound eye of the bee, in any direction and at an angle of 300 degrees can see, play an important role. 
To investigate the function of the compound eye imitate the researchers attacked the idea of the laser distance meter on. 
This identifies obstacles before BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters calculated their distance and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The obstacle is in fractions of a second registered car and the robot immediately change course, similar to the movement of bees by the tires at the appropriate angle turns. 
Unlike existing systems, this maneuver rather than a purely instinctive. 
"If it were not the case, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the robot car project. 
The system must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology is the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield represents - a shift within the accidents are still valid as inevitable. 
The entire process must be the behavior of bees reflect, when they dodge other bees. 
And this must be a fraction of a second run. 
However, the evasive action, in contrast to the bees, not up, down or diagonally done - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the applicability of the tires. 
While the bees are an infinite number of possibilities open to other bees avoid, the researchers were able to robotic car only when the rotational movement, or the Accel and decel operate. 
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries. 
Andoh said, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to save. 
This device must per second just a few inputs to process and respond to them accordingly. 
It must not store or on the basis of previous maneuvers an intuitive, logical reaction to produce, so keep it just a handful of KB Memory takes. 
There is no need for megabytes and gigabytes-heavy memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, according to estimates from Nissan within the next ten years standard in production will be. 
Another application could be the technology in the GPS satellite navigation can be found by motorists deliberately steers around obstacles and so it leads to your destination. 
A name for the child sündteure 
Now is the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package before the law, in several stages and will be applied to the purchase of bad loans from the banks targeted. 
In the first round is half the money spent. 
In a session on Saturday after midnight east coast time came to an end, the Congress MPs after several discussions to reach an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package durchgerungen serious, reported Reuters. 
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the American House of Representatives, and said that we need to agree only on paper. 
The compromise reached over the rescue package supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said on the outcome: The program is effective and it is efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi were it not for the rescue of Wall Street, but about the helm of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written version of the package was completed before the opening of Asian markets, namely, Sunday evening Washington time clock 8 (Central European Time Monday 2 clock morning), published, but has no soaring on the stock markets triggered. 
On Monday the House of Representatives approves first on the bill to stabilize the economy in 2008, then the Senate's turn. 
President George W. Bush said on Saturday evening with Pelosi and even the White House welcomed the news about the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress of the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties, our markets to stabilize and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
The program, however, differs from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration that the 700 billion U.S. dollars at once for the purchase lazier, with aggressive lending securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche will be up to half of the 700-billion-dollar amount spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the congress as expected on Monday on the Seton will vote. This sum will cover the purchase of aggressive lending, securities that are worse, and the other 100 billion USD should the president decide. 
The program is run by a separate Commission, which is also the president of the Federal Reserve belongs. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision from the Congress. 
For the purposes of the Act, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combination of tactics: It can simultaneously bad loans, mortgages, and burdened with mortgages to buy securities, or other "toxic" loans. 
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported the purchase in an auction, as well as directly made. 
The law allows the affected companies, in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance of the alarming means guaranteed, and the company expected damages to pay fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: The Act defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion U.S. dollars as emergency assistance to the U.S. financial system can be made available, whether it be for the large-scale buying bad funds, their insurance, or to avoid a systemic risk, by the collapse of a major financial institution is triggered. 
We shall take the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready for the introduction of the Act, once it was signed, so Paulson. 
The leaders of the troubled and now dependent on government assistance, however, banks may reckon that their severance payments in the overseas slang loosely "golden handshake" called by the government be reduced. 
A reduction in salaries, there will be only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance each aushilft. 
The reduction means in essence that if the Ministry as part of an auction ankauft, said the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the disused bank chief in the pension deported. 
In the case of a direct purchase of bad loans will aggressively turn on the government to ensure that the managers salaries not be exaggerated. 
On the picture is also that the existing Golden Handshake contracts not be changed - the restrictions apply only to new agreements, so the more people participate in the program. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries be regulated by law, said the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. 
The state is gaining participation rights at the participating banks, so the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they also can participate as soon as the economy and hence the bank again rescued better. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress in the next five years, a proposal must, like the taxpayers their money lost from the financial sector will be back again. 
There were, however, skeptics on both sides, in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan protects the taxpayers' money in no case, said the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were by the same people pushed, including the collapse of Wall Street are responsible.

Press review of the German-speaking area 
The stock right is intact, only the voters were inside the warehouse self - so commenting "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria, Haider and co ready to govern, to a red-black coalition to prevent. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the online edition of the German left-based news magazine Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria revolution vertilgt their fathers." 
According to the renowned political scientists began the erosion of the CSU long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his offices. 
The Christsozialen have renewed Bavaria for decades - just now turning to the modern citizens from them. 
The Epoch fracture is simultaneously a problem of Christian Democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite surprisingly came the disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday is something ended, but what is already quite apparent exactly ten years: the unquestionable hegemony of a State Party 
Even ten years ago, 1998, landed at the CSU 47.7 percent and fell for the first time since the fifties at the fifty-percent mark 
The repeated itself three years ago when the Bundestag elections in 2005, so even in the much quoted Stoiber era. 
The CSU in the Land Modernizing has consistently operated at long last, their own mothers and fathers vertilgt. 
Sociologists had already predicted 40 years ago, but that the pace considerably verschätzt. But without the impact could secularization, education successes, the inflow of east and north Germans in the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters not to stay. 
Modernization is always accompanied with warrants propagation. And this has political consequences. 
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp were critical and assertive. 
It is striking that in recent weeks, almost the classic citizens' groups the greatest distance to the CSU, said the liberal professions, the industrial bourgeoisie and voters with high school as graduates. 
Here sank the support of the CSU to even below 40 percent. 
The press (diepresse.com) 
The conservative Vienna newspaper reported in its "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition questions" titled article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the elections. 
The SPÖ would like to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs. 
The BZÖ is reflected in all directions open for talks, while the Greens in relation to a coalition not yet want to define. 
The elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition, in the debates on public television the party leaders could hardly look at their cards. 
SPÖ chief Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the Austrian People's Party want to. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation between the two parties is quite possible - in some states and in the social partnership, this is already the case. 
The question of whether he is because a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chief as ÖVP Vice Chancellor, could imagine, let Faymann open. 
As he said, voters would have the bowl Molterer course voted. 
A repetition of this direction would not in question. 
Molterer has, however, on red offers cautious response. 
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann attempts to interfere in internal issues of the ÖVP involved. 
Whether his party in opposition or in the coalition goes, is currently completely open, and these issues should ÖVP be discussed internally. 
BZÖ leader Joerg Haider was open in all directions. 
"To red-black to prevent, we are ready, government responsibility," said Haider. 
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken 
Today in Paris the European summit on EO started the year by the EU Ratspräsidentschaftsland France will be aligned. 
In its plenary addressed to the speech made Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Members of the European People's Party, in particular the formation of segregation carefully, because this is one of the most serious rights violations, the plight of Roma children, this was also the biggest obstacle to their application needs. 
The high-level conference was organized by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened. 
Among the participants were representatives from governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civic organizations in the field of equal opportunities. 
As the press office of MEPs Fidesz reports Járóka has pointed out that apart from discrimination in the job, the Roma in the first place because of their low education levels would be ousted from the job market. 
"The vast majority of young Roma has no secondary education, and thanks to a poor basic education can only be a small part of them reach a degree." 
Furthermore Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right was the zukäme a key role in the assertion of other human rights. 
Investing in early education of Roma children could the economy of the EU member states strengthen. 
According to the MPs, it is important that these relationships possible wider circle - in other words, Roma and non-Roma - be aware. 
Because the sooner a Roma school begins, the more increase his chances for productive member of the labor market; and through income and sales tax make their contribution to national spending. 
"As citizens, Roma must have the right to quality education be secured - the poor and segregated classes should be" - so Lívia Járóka. 
As the deputies said, is a common goal and action-action by the European Union needed to Desegregationsprozess in the education sector to accelerate. This is the proper observance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives essential.

CSU: grace period to 
At the end of October is about the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein decided 
Despite the election debacle roll meanwhile still no heads, at the head of the Bavarian CSU staff debates were postponed. 
Party chief and Prime Minister Erwin Huber Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this lasts grace. 
About the fate of the duo after the disastrous 17-percent loss will vote on the last weekend in October at the extraordinary party congress decided. 
The much gescholtene duo had already imply that it is not glued to their armchairs wish. 
So they want to be the angry group and placate the party base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of an absolute majority demanded personal consequences. 
Five years ago - admitted that under the leadership of the climax of his career following Edmund Stoiber - reached the Christian Social Union still 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, they could only 43.4 percent of the votes secure. 
The CSU was 46 years lang 'Alleinregierer "in Bavaria, the 18 percent of German GDP. 
The Conservatives remain the dominant force in the well for the Hungarian economy important southern province, but will in future need a coalition to govern. 
The first sign of partisan internal restructuring is the potential successor Huber, vice president and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer also in the exploration team involved with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "liberal voters" exploratory talks about a possible coalition Munich leads. 
One irony of fate is equal to that list of "Free voters" those Gabriele Pauli in the legislature comes into it, whose anti-Stoiber occurrence of the Huber-Beckstein duo first utilized in order to then-minded politician abzuservieren mercilessly. 
The CSU leadership now concentrated all its forces to stabilize Beckstein. 
In this transition process will Stoiber, the date the threads from the background attracted an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called 28 September "day of its bitterest political career." 
On Monday Huber made a few remarks in the direction of toxic CDU - in his view, the CSU had far more support from the sister party deserves. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel. 
If the CSU in 2005 and at national level, much success has helped, not with a joint effort back on the footing can be Merkel after the Bundestag elections in September 2009 not to be chancellor again. 
Merkel, who made their disappointment over the fiasco has made no secret, believes that the loss terrain of the CSU will not adversely affect the grand coalition in Berlin impact. 
What, however, is relatively: The wounded CSU is not easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however, goes further. 
With 18.6 percent reached the SPD its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0 
In the elections on Sunday it has no deputy of the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament managed. 
Russian observers believe that this is the prosperity and stability in the country led Alexander Lukashenko, the OECD suggested, however, Law adversity in the counting of votes. 
The OECD, consisting of 43 countries has sent 450 observers, the elections were not recognized. 
De legislature of the 10-million-state residents coming for decades without opposition from. Nonetheless, which under the name "United Democratic Forces (ODS) The Counterparty gathered yesterday before the elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006 presidential mandate already renewed for the fourth time, this time some members of the Opposition in Parliament "permit" would. 
Therefore, the ODS even from the previously planned boycotts abandoned. 
Ukraine is due to the rising prices for gas imported from Russia increasingly dependent economically. For the alleviation of the price increases were actually loans and the country has also the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, the Russians agreed. In the background of expectations of the opposition was therefore the hope that Ukraine wants its relations with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians because of the anti-classified as a political system in the EU travel ban have. 
For a temporary relaxation of the evaluation report caused the elections to the OECD, in which the emphasis is more on the positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one-third of opposition candidates from the elections - was. 
However, criticized the quick OECD report on Monday, the campaign - the opposition should therefore not appear in the press - and particularly the fact that the opposition in the counting of votes could not be present. 
Despite all the opposition is capable of improvement in the political system recognize: Political prisoners were about to walk free, and Minsk is even smaller confrontations with Moscow prepared by the continued recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia denied although Russia, the Ukraine to the Paper, a Föderativstaat forms, the two areas since a month as separate. 
"We have two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkevich to our leaf. 
According to the opposition candidates of the presidential election of 2006 is a continuation desirable, although "the mighty afraid that even a single opposition members into parliament to be." 
The opposition plans to protest any actions in the face of the results, but rather seeks the need for economic reform to make it clear to voters. 
"We have here with many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, local authorities put us in the distribution obstacles in the way, but I see that more and more people support the change, even the older" - said Milinkevich, in allusion to the fact that not even the stratum of Pensionisten meistunterstützte with the Lukashenko regime agrees, whose only merit in the manufacture of social security. 
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit is merely a matter of time until the silence of a cemetery gemahnende" social security "begins to crumble," said Milinkevich. 
In contrast to Russian opposition politicians have observer the elections as democratic means. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States said the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds and not words." The absence of the opposition was therefore a testament to the maturity of the Belarusian voters. 
Brunetta: "From now on will be eaten before work" 
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the entry and exit of officials. 
Starting today, the measure against those clever Meier enter into force, which only stamped, and then during working coffee drink. 
The new "anti-sluggard-Law" was signed today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers presented. 
"&gt;" Rotating doors were a means to improve work efficiency through a higher attendance rates and more services, "said Minister Brunetta. 
"Now begins a new era of accountability and transparency. 
This is reformism, "Brunetta underlines once again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers. 
Masi says this: "the choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value." 
From the side of officials there was no opposition, assured the Secretary General: "This process has been supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides." 
All in all, there is now no breakfast during the working hours more, closing with coffee or croissant. 
Brunettas advises this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 clock works wonders." 
During a meeting of the Upper Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
of Rome, the minister announced that "within three months, the absence of officials at 50%, ie 60,000 persons per year more at work are present." 
He adds that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of public administration in Italy to strengthen 
"whose wage dynamics - as the minister - were in the last 8-10 years is twice as large as the private sector and well above the inflation rate." 
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants joined forces to the Brunetta Decree in the context of Codacons supported entgegenzuarbeiten appeal. 
"While the minister for public service with lower figures on absences when working profiling - so writes the Consumer Center - grows the people of the 'lazy workers' unbroken. 
In fact, thousands correct and valuable civil servants joined forces to oppose the legal norms of the decree to declare war. " 
In particular, before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related illness fought, so will the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick workers policyholder, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the innovations of the minister appealed. 
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents is crucial" 
Every day happened in Italy 2500 accidents, three people are killed and 27 remain disabled for life. 
For the year 2007 confirm the details of the INAIL (Istituto Nazionale Contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) namely that the fatal accidents in 1200 were around. 
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which is almost twice as many deaths as murders by arise. 
Today, the Anmil (Mutilati Associazione Nazionale del Lavoro invalid e) in all provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of occupational accidents perpetrators, so the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation to steer. 
"The concern, of Anmil disseminated data and the tragic news these days to confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace." Confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his message to the President of Amil (Associazione Nazionale del mutilati ed Invalid lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli. 
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplaces, to protect the injured workers, to aid the families of the victims and to sensitize the public opinion." 
"An indignant" Basta "has raised this; understandable when tragedies that, measured by its magnitude, some vertebrae in the media and the public sympathy trigger. But the everyday reality confronts us with often dramatic events that are in their own momentum even can be repeated. " 
Napolitano does not hide that "in any case also a resource problem: there must be decisive in education and information will be invested." 
A special importance to the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school part of the youths who are of working to nurture them to. 
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon, and not by his social Ernst case. You must be a legislative standard put into effect and improve. 
For its part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related fatalities an urgent social emergency forms, which the conscience of us all offended and all institutions to forcing firm rules at work, with the objective of the problem to an end Anyway ". 
"The data of the accidents seem a slight improvement to signal this would not exclude that the number of workplace deaths is far too high," the President stressed Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" positive trend "means less attention. Exactly what caused the tragedy at the end." 
"How believe that in fact too little to stop the phenomenon of accidents oppose. You can browse through various actions, on the other hand fighting. 
Stronger checks and inspections are necessary in our opinion - as Mercandelli, but even stronger measures to educate workers who are already in school to begin. " 
"A further effort is needed - so he added - what the communication and awareness of public opinion is concerned. 
But most of all is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers against a phenomenon which represents a social emergency, asked. " 
Mercandelli was important also to "the continuing deterioration of protection for accident victims to speak and denounced the" abolition of the welfare system, against which we in recent years to fight ". 
"The goal is, consequently, the workers a guarantee return on insurance, so the fate of victims of industrial accidents are not accidental or voluntary donations, from time to time by a legislature to be decided, will depend". 
Mp3 player under indictment: risk of hearing loss 
Loud music over a longer period with portable music devices such as 3-Mp player to hear, can cause permanent hearing damage lead. 
This notifies the European Commission, which in a widely used today in Brussels report the views of the Csrseri (scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) quoted the EU. 
"From the report - as it says in a note - it is clear that 5-10% of people who at least five years a week longer than one hour a day loud music with portable music devices listen to the permanent loss of their hearing at risk." 
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume make their voices heard, without knowing it irreparably damaged," said Meglena Kuneva. 
"From the scientific findings - it is said by the EU - is a clear risk that too rapid action is pressing. 
What really counts is that consumer awareness and to disseminate this information to make commons. 
We must face this scientific knowledge, the existing control again check, so they are completely and effectively with the new technology to keep pace. " 
Brussels, the independent scientific committee, given the widespread use of portable music devices among young people charged. 
"The scientists - concludes the statement of the EU - to confirm that it is rightly worried and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders now take the necessary measures will investigate to children and young people better before the noise, from portable music devices and similar devices will protect you. " 
There already exists at the moment a European standard, the level of noise from portable music devices on 100 dB limited. The concern over the damage resulting from a large noise pollution will come. 
You can damage these very narrow down where you to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the suspension noise attacks. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the European Union pointed out that if the users of portable music devices, only five hours a week loud (louder than 89 decibels) music, so that the statutory limits had been exceeded in relation to the maximum sound level the job apply. 
Those who exceed this limit music, risking the complete loss of hearing within five years. 
So the concern 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number at 2.5 to 10 million people in Europe can be estimated. 
Roma, Alemanno fires the starting gun for the "Commission for the future of the capital" 
We will start today, March's past will be in June will take stock. 
This is the end of the Capitol set for the work of the Commission on the Future of the capital Rome. " The Commission has this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla baths taken. 
In six months, the President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission, the guides prepare for Rome. 
Once the project is completed, the city council and the analysis and evaluation of projects, in June in order to be able to the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno provide to imagine can. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", - stressed Alemanno. "They will consider proposals for a development offer for Rome, whose political leaders of the city and the council remain. 
There is no redistribution of powers, only the desire to have a place where you have a great project for Rome can develop. 
In March, their task will be terminated and the Commission will dissolve, because such a project a certain time endpoint must have. 
In June - as the mayor announced - will be the strategic plan we imagine, in which we now find the Commission's work will use ". 
Who the competence of the Commission in question, as to liability whose opinion NO, the Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work which the Commission will afford and the quality of the proposals from. 
If they are, as in France, the Attali Commission, high-quality results - and this is certainly in Rome in the case - then their contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that may from time to time. 
We, however, want a longer period in mind, so with a deeper perspective seriously in the development of Rome and the future of the city work. " 
The Mayor of Rome, sets much value on the following to clarify "This commission is neither a useless body, still a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, they will not Roman citizens cents and it will cost us think bring. It is the best brains The capital employed. " 
According to Alemanno "it is necessary to develop a strategic plan to have the hermetically neither static nor, to our city a quantum leap - she really needs - to allow, and so a common step in the future to do." 
A future, said the mayor of Rome, which "not only in the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further, not only regarding the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Obama - the first anti-American President? Here is a statement 
A prominent American politicians, the lot because, when viewed to be independent, has written: "Barack Obama is the second anti-American President. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, through its decisions, which decimated the U.S. economy and with the Islamic Relations befeindeten used (and still does as a private man). " 
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly fierce, especially now that the elections are approaching. 
A lady from Miami, in a Web page is written: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he is the highest office of a nation, which total two black governors and five black senators has seen. " 
Actually, these attacks have not much to say it is racist attacks, and they do not answer the question of voters: he will be a good president? And then there are the polls all say that Obama with a big head start will win. 
Even in this case there are people associated with the heart and not with the talking head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has in its editorial wrote: only in the polling booth, we will probably know who the true American patriot, his voice gets. 
Here's a mentality of the United States to light, up to last has been kept hidden. 
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether Obama or McCain." 
There are people there who swear: If Obama wins, we will emigrate from the Americas. 
Something you never heard before - only now, where the success of black candidates seem so sure. 
In all cases, in spite of all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were asked: What mistakes, Bush has accomplished during his tenure committed? 89% have responded: the war in Iraq. 
America is changing. 
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was a kick in the ass again sent home. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of the weakness of Bush. 
Those who will take his place, faces a huge task. 
USA. The financial collapse is survived by his footsteps even when journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "assassins" of the printing press. 
Five hundred American Journalists were approved by the PEW Research Center on their situation and their mental control questioned concerning the future. 
Today, almost all journalists pessimistic about their future. 
Nevertheless, they compared the information on those responsible are not really concerned about the overall credibility. 
You do not feel so alone as before. 
The problem for American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed. 
Added to the major problems through the newsroom cuts taken, so the space in which the editors working to compile the newspaper. 
It is a problem that must be resolved - that the journalists interviewed - if you avoid the traditional journalism, such as the large audience understands him, not shrinking significantly. 
A clear, but complicated pessimism today met the American journalist. 
Six out of ten journalists and Senior Executive of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism on a national level on the wrong track was. 
In the local area are among the executives even to 65%. 
Vs. printed. Broadcast. 
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the Web is. 
The main publishing groups Railways is the way to the Internet, which many see as the "killer" of the printing press to be critical. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists feel is up to 79% increase. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to the new technology to connect to, in the hope they bring something good for journalism. " 
The biggest rift exists in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of editors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level are only 23%. 
Some think it has with the "safety in the work to be done. 
The managers who are afraid their work within three years to lose is 47% at national level. 
When the journalists are 30%. 
The theme of the "safe working" in the team (our "Editors' Editor's note) in the U.S. is always a hot topic. 
Only 13% of journalists working under contract. 
In a vast nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators to offer the employer as they are popular and there will be a question of take it or leave it. 
The chief editors often get very high wages, the editor the other hand, can sometimes only 10000 euro per month given to pension and insurance funds. 
As for the holiday, there is the matter complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, and so many after the third, and finally after a certain number of years 15 vacation days to reach. 
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit in the course of the year are often "sick". 
It is a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO Coppola REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The President of the second chamber of the Criminal Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the estate agent. This was asked of Grottaferrata to Rome to be relocated. 
It is against Coppola for Bankrot in the context of the agreement in the case against the takeover by Unipol Bnl. determined. 
During the trial against him during the last week, was his release from house arrest in a residence requirement in Grottaferrata converted. 
His lawyer Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent, from the provincial town in an apartment in the capital to be relocated. 
According to the court he could such transfers (against which the public prosecutor had issued) the possibility that his company to influence him and reproachful evidence to reach. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already been a few days ago revealed as the Chamber of Deputies against 700 billion-dollar savings of the White House agreed: One large part of the Americans was and is more interested in Wall Street to punish than to save the economy. 
This confirms yesterday's edition of The New York Times, which reported how the crisis over step divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into their old and moderate East Coast soul, always state institutions and the business community and beneficiary those neoconservative, the "where Washington and the financial world is hostile and mainly in the south and the center of the states voters. 
This part of the party owes its rise above the voice of his that I mentioned above. 
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake, or even already announcing itself: not only in the U.S., even throughout the West and perhaps even beyond will be affected by this. 
Both in the states as well as in Europe seems to be the long-feared crisis to speed events, which under these new conditions finally take shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy. 
In fact, the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which has close links to foreign countries and also possess a tremendous amount of assets managed by private households, which in a single state resident. 
This means an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how it compared to the affected families is to behave, which is also an enormous mass of voters. 
The crisis appears so globally economically, politically, on the other hand, it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to be in the sidelines to his speech and his right to have lost: The evidence for this is obvious from the EU to pursue that because of their division into various national and international conflicts no common way to find white. 
Therefore, all now reckon with the intervention of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis was always serious, only the United States in the economic situation without foreign help to rescue. 
And in addition to the resources they have also the legitimacy to use them: hence two not to be judgmental about conditions - under certain circumstances - which probably no other international organization and no market in a similar way can draw is. 
That new emphasis on the state-national element will be paid in the rest is in perfect harmony with the growing importance that recently in the economy with a closely related sector is brought in connection: the territoriality. 
Paradoxical way, it is precisely now, when we are so convinced were long in a networked total occurred realm to be in a realm of increasingly sophisticated technology, the intangible that we once observed, as our future but more and more of the essential material things will depend on: water, crop and oil. 
This can certainly all from one place to another in the world are transported, but are nevertheless extremely narrowly circumscribed with a piece of ground - a territory. 
It is the one who possesses such a territory has, over another, in a yield-free, water-free or oil-free area lives in advantage. 
I come now to the second novelty, but a short slot requires. 
Who Territory, who Government, who Policy says, says hence leadership. 
In this sense, it seems that the financial crisis two converging phenomena to produce. 
One is awareness of the need Leaderships respected, so the need for someone who knows how to get things in place. 
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing tours, especially those of the economy, which is considered inadequate and full of shadow zones have turned. 
Moreover, finally, a deep-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: A loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of Unzweckmäßigkeit, a feeling of distance, all on a whole class of managers of the Western countries targeted. 
It seems to be the conviction among large segments of the population the way for motorways, that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but their idea world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whether, whose salary is the Majority as always alien and Overturning represents. 
The demand for leadership nourishes So a branched underground but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected "revolts" in the electorate and the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind lately: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labor Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the Right in Italy a role here). 
One gets the impression, as did the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals creditors, some would say their format, with more understanding of problems and therefore less representative value regarding what today in the lower social strata of the West is going on and from the financial crisis exacerbated and to Überdimensionalität driven. 
Given all this, it would be quite an exaggeration, of a "rebellion of the masses" to speak. 
The eyes wide open but to keep it safe, however, is not. 
The super glue, which can go up walls 
The forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive to defeat and highly walls climb to as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now apparently almost at the destination is. 
With an area of only 2.5 qcm applied glue, it is the researchers succeeded in a 100 kg body on a vertical wall to fix. 
STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory published. 
The team of researchers from the invented material is a development of the glues used already, what a special carbon structure, known as carbon nanotubes, use. 
"The principle of the glue can be like a series on a stack arranged spaghetti tubes imagine," said Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have developed from the feet of geckos inspiration, which are microscopic hairs covering the animal give a perfect stop. 
The various materials such as Teflon and glass sand tests have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more than the ability to hold the feet of reptiles and at the same time "from the wall easily remove it," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences of the University of Dayton. 
WALLS TO ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a glue used perishable," continues Liming Dai added. 
Around the walls like Spiderman to emporzugehen? Perhaps already, but the researchers think more to a less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also directors of heat and electricity. 
Other application areas could be in the field of aerospace fall. 
For the moment, the superhero is still waiting. 
THE OTHER KIND OF RESEARCH - including the University of Berkeley, California, dedicated to a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American Chemical Society will present the Californian scientists glue from the micro-fibers like hair by movement on a surface cleanse themselves from dust and therefore always a perfect liability coverage. 
Medicines: Never take fruit juice 
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice. 
These drinks, which because of its refreshing quality and richness of their vitamin mainly consumed in summer, can cause serious health damage if it combined with certain vital medicines, as they relate to the inclusion of these through the body in extreme ways you can. 
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed to the risk of packaged as fresh fruit juices in combination with medication out. As part of the 236th Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again Alarm: Just a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to the receptivity of certain vital medications to reduce the extent that these are virtually eliminated, and so the health of patients at risk. 
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion, to be responsible for the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, cardiovascular drugs, and neurological anxiolytischer funds, up to toxic levels to increase. 
MEDICINES IN DANGER - The same agency had the medicine in a report two years ago, doctors and patients against the dangers of this mix warned, and stressed to make sure what is happening in conjunction with resources such as Diazepan or Metadon is drunk. 
IT IS NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts include orange juice and apple juice substances, which can inhibit the medicines. 
The list of fruit juices inhibited substances is long. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the University Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately to the various international manufacturers forwarded to which it is free to consumers to change the information. 
Therefore, it is always the leaflet read, and if there are still ambiguities, not afraid to have a pharmacist or doctor, "the expert stressed the Ansa agency. 
Economics Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economy Prize is to the Americans Paul Krugman for his analysis of trading patterns and the location of economic activities. 
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, at the University of Princeton and teaches known for his regular articles for The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of economic and foreign policies of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had an editorial in the New York Times claimed that this second event was crucial for the history of the United States than the attacks. 
A prediction that not a little controversy as a response received and the economists have been accused years later, but now as a fully proven right. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals under the collapses of Enron or Worldcom from the public view are gone," said Krugman end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also trivialize with a "very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration directed." 
OpenOffice, it appears the third version of the "anti-Microsoft" package 
The day the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived, the open-source software is gaining a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under Clear creators as well as in public administration.

Against eight was also on the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, the new formats (. Docx,. Xlsx,. Pptx) by OpenOffice can be read. 
Are also some interesting new features, such as those that allows the size of PowerPoint presentations to reduce, for example, the sending via email easier. This includes the possibility of PDF files in graphics processing modules to import, while the original appearance of the site to preserve. 
Sun can now also "hybrid" generate PDF files, what the typical graph of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a word processing system invented. 
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of applications: Multi-tables can now be handled by different users, resulting in changes to avoid conflicts, in the case of the word processing system, each edit Frabe assigned to a better correction procedures to guarantee. 
Some companies are turning to different features of OpenOffice on the Internet to publish (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result will be publicized. 
The Italian version is available on the following link to download available: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which since Friday on the mirrors is located. 
Except for Windows and Mac OS is also the program for the Linux operating system available. 
At the request can be the installation CD into the home or office can send. 
However, the cost can be a spur freedom for the dissemination of the program in private households, so it is precisely in the area of business where the big OpenOffice could throw succeed: finally are already several institutions of public administration and schools to OpenOffice transferred. 
Indeed, there is not even on a training range, which is an optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus business prospects even opened. 
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word relevant text creation program, Calc, the Table Program, which is a predatory aims of Excel, Impress, for creating presentations like Powerpoint; Dbase databases to operate in place of the more popular Access; and Last Draw, a graphics module. 
The goal for 2008 is 5 million downloads to achieve - a goal which is already reached 3 million and 600 thousand also easily be exceeded. 
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case 
It opens a new doping case mi part of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athletes Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, and as Drittklassifizierter winner of the jersey of best climber. 
The news published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website. 
The 26-year-old Kohl of Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who positively to Cera, the third generation of Epo, was tested. Previously it has already met with the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher to. 
The analysis of blood samples Kohl are among those who in recent weeks by the laboratories and Losanna Chatenay-Malabry made. 
Against the samples confirm the positive results now at Cera, the Austrians lose his third place and two years of the races are excluded. 
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and from whom, according to the Associated Press, the Austrian States. 
The 26-year-old Austrians went behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and Cadel Evans of the Americans on the podium and also claimed the jersey of best climber for themselves. 
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY racists? 
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has been recently one of the favorite countries for immigrants have become", which only with reluctance to be. 
Do this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a lengthy article, the whole issue of racism in Italy and is dedicated to the case of the young, from Burkina Faso stämmigen Abdul William Guibre out of a month ago in Milan, was murdered after a pack of biscuits had stolen. 
The case testifies to what the Times as the "paradox of the North called" the northern regions are those in which "most integration and job opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationistischen sentiment and the largest support of the Lega Nord has been seen. " 
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants in the Times relies on more episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only that. 
Even the new, through the League introduced legislation against immigration and to speed up deportation of illegal immigrants is a sign of climate change in Italy indicated. 
A movement, which is also the pope and the president to emphasize: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to ensure cooperation between church and state to combat racism." 
Students victims of up to 900-euro per room high Mietspreise 
The market for housing for students knows no crises. 
According to a recent study of Sunia, the tenants union, a single student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome cost. 
"This phenomenon has already adopted a very serious trains. Whole droves of students as effectively lose their right to study, because their families are not able to include them in this amount to support" - as the person responsible for the Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the large demand from students to a deformity of the market, which also has other residents injured. 
Moreover, most include a range of accommodations violations: free contracts, lack of registrations, without limit rent, unauthorized sub rents. 
For Sunia is a need for extraordinary measures, which through a revision of taxation lead to lower rents. 
A closer look at the investigation, it turns out that in Milan roost in the Brianza district approximately 450 euros are needed, a single room starts at 650 euros (Bande Nere in the quarter) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera, or even 900 euros in the quarter Vittoria. 
In Florence sleep an average cost of a 350/400 euros, a room 700th 
In Bologna, where the students are in the neighborhoods around the University of focus are 250/280 euros for a roost of hardships, from 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university at about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a berth in a double room. 
Only slightly lower rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities in Rome: 550 euro in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only those who ausweicht in outer districts can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Cento Celle and similar neighborhoods. 
In Naples we needed 300-450 euros for a bed, a room for the price from 400 to 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
Bari cost of a sleeping 250-350 euros, a single minimum 350th 
In the smallest towns, prices are lower, but they have a bigger weight in the urban economy. 
In the cities in which the phenomenon of the lease to non-European students frequent, such as in Perugia, there is even a further anomaly: a rental, around 25-30% above the average, foreign students are required. 
Goodbye to the old Cinema Paradiso - the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic movie theaters closed because of the beneficiary multiplex cinemas. 
"A city without cinemas, a blind city, like a face without eyes." 
This picture of director Giuseppe Tornatore, with effect describes what is currently in the major urban centers in Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. 
The process of exclusion of cinemas, with the birth of the large multi-hall complexes in the periphery started, it means the long-term death for the Einsaalkino in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irreversible, but also the traits of a cultural crime carries. 
Affected are mostly historical places full of memories, "it is like to lose a friend with whom you have a piece of street full of emotion go," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" to him 20 years ago the Oscar and the great Price of Cannes revenue. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists, in a probably forever lost cinema world to live. 
The figures, which ANEC, the central trade association delivers, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the tremendous amount by 316 traditional cinemas must close this mine paid for the most part, the cinemas in big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 to 5 in Turin and Palermo. 
Among the most affected regions include the Emilia-Romagna, with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41st 
This demonstrates that the culprit multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinema has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the lists of Lombardy, 81 are both in the Tuscany, as well as in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has improved in an irrational manner developed," said Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, "it is useful to ensure that new structures, but in the first place is the preservation of existing, as a hall closes in the city, are not all of his regulars ready to replace the old a multiplex cinema in the peripheral facilities. 
And here remains the lack of budget for the fund industry association of the outer Eight: the state recorded debt burden is around 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws. 
In order to maintain the sector would be 16 to 18 million euros a year smarter. " 
What is interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which due to fears of the old cinema has decided this by an agreement between the municipality and the ANEC to protect it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy, which aims promote the traditional cinemas to protect and support, both in the historical center, as well as in the periphery. 
Among the planned measures are also divisions for fiscal Before the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public regarding the transport: there will be allowed into the areas of the Center verkehrslimitierten to drive and also to lower parking fees to park. 
"It is a welcome initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and beyond even new design concepts. 
Certainly, but we also need a better audio and video equipment, to oppose the super power of Multiplexsäle something to be able to align, because the audience is more demanding today. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is for me always been an important issue: the closure of the "Super Cinema" by Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that brought me to the "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" to establish, even if I have 10 years with the thought had played. 
For 25 years I lived in Rome, when I am at the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale temporarily, wherever I am so many different emotions experienced, I turn to the side, not the dust posters to be seen. 
The connections between politics and the 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to support the decisions of the community in the interests of the mafia group Piromalli adapt .. 
The accusations of the Attorney General of the Anti-Mafia of Calabria authority against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario municipality Schiavone of Gioia Tauro, the morning because of involvement in mafia operations were arrested, are serious. 
Put in handcuffs was also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the lawyer, who the same name as the boss of the clan bear, was already due to involvement in criminal organizations have condemned the Mafia, then to a sum of 10 million euros. 
"Any kind of moral and legal standard disregard," said the lawyers write, "had the two local administrations decided, the lawyer for Piromalli money to pay for consultancy work." 
"Thus, it was the mafia group has been made possible - as the judges - the official way to the town halls and penetrate the policy of the administration say." 
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio LOIERO not be denied that in his region "anything but an exception is to connections from local administrations and organized crime to come." "There are places in which the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are virtually inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians, the pressure from the 'Ndrangheta resist: heroes who will receive a white vest. " 
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, which according to the police Piromalli clan was beheaded. 
Since the end of last April was the council of Gioia Tauro been dissolved, but in 1991 - and even then because of alleged links between organized crime and local governance - were local politicians, their community office have been. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the UDC, is after the runoff election from May 2006 to head the center right coalition was elected. 
He screamed scandal as the prefecture the dissolution of the Municipal Council ordered. 
He pointed to the Vice Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused, all from political and strategic reasons to have invented. The judges, however, explain in connection with the arrest this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to propose an amendment of the A3 project to apply. 
For a interception action in connection with the investigations on the case Torrione Dal, the willingness shown to the wishes of an entrepreneur halfway, which is known by a representative of the large group at the Piromalli is - which measures the public administration is identical with the interests of this clan were ". 
If the energy comes from the waves, suddenly running on the Great 
It is a non versiegende money source, which over 70% of the surface of the planet covered and only now seems that the big energy companies in the world to understand. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources at all now look, and also to occupy search giants such as Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win, is already 70 years since considered and investigated, not coincidentally, these studies have intensified since the first oil crisis considerably. 
As the price of oil around 1980 collapse forgot the idea of marine energy, but now pushing the environmental organizations and the increase in oil prices to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London, estimates that 15% of global energy by the ocean waves generated energy could be met. 
This would double the currently produced by nuclear power energy equal. 
Would also add the currents and tides. 
Giants at the attack. 
The first company, which is now on the marine energy, is ENERSIS, in 2005 a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal has signed. 
When this news was published seemed to be a revolutionary step to act. 
Two years later there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry, on the marine energy use. 
"Chevron investigated these technologies" - as the spokesman of the assets of a US-American company known giants in the Wall Street Journal - and weigh the possibility to cooperate with us. " 
It is here to acquire a license from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is needed for a project off the coast of Alaska to start. 
This is a no appreciable signs, especially when you consider that it is still oil in Alaska by the United States is encouraged and President Bush recently the plans for new wells put in motion. 
Beside Chevron, the company Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to the new industry to invest, the details are not known, but observers speak of rising interest. 
Even improvement technologies. 
Experts speak of a still on the move by local technology, not least because not even the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have been resolved. 
So far, projects like the one in Portugal and also from Scotland rather small dimension and does not seem serious to cause ecological problems. 
But energy on a large scale to produce the required technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power about using a system of interconnected buoys. 
The thrust of the waves, which buoys up and down moves within the float on pistons and cylinders converted into hydraulic pressure. 
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator. 
The stream will be under water pipes on the coast cleverly. 
Until now, there are four planned investment of this nature, which only have to wait for the government approval. A part of the energy gained could be used for military institutions. 
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a goods store and a parking using submarine turbines in the East River of New York. 
The water movements during the tidal drives the turbines, which by turning the nascent movement feeds the generator. 
According to Verdant already waits a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorizations for these energy sources to use. 
Only the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest earned, according to the Institute for electricity generation research instantly the potential which lies in the tides. 
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, but the tides are more predictable than wind currents, the sunlight and the waves, and therefore a trusted source of power. 
Indeed, the tidal energy is what states like New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have led already 7.5 million U.S. dollars in 2008 to invest - for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned.
