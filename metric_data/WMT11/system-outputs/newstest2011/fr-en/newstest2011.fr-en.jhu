That is what will happen? cssd is not voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The newly elected cssd at the town hall of the capital will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand the local council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The Daily actualne.cz has "tested" the new Council Members belonging to cssd at whether they know the argôt who was born in recent years in the town hall, where were the current coalition partners who headed in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that cream policy of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some personalities, situations, and causes of France.
It is surprised that it was discovered that the newly elected do not understand very well the known terms.
At least the say.
"That is valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a political jeunôt in the pragoise reacted lukas kaucky, the elected to the culture to the vocabulary of 'Godfather' test.
And with respect to the veteran politician, the elected Karel brezina responded in the same way.
For example the meaning of "hole golf."
"This is the only ones I propose that I use the term"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
Vocabulary, including the aktualne.cz Daily published The expressions in June this year before the convention pré-éĺectoral ODS, the wording has chosen 6 examples, preferably those associated with the city of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "voldemort," "the greatest hole Golf in Prague," go in the patisserie beef, "" nerve, "" betrayal of the capital "and" entôler."
Three of the elected have agreed to the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin weinert, who should lead the education in Prague in the future - promised first a but then did not pick up the telephone interview.
The fifth elected Petr dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I am not involved at all of these things lá and how delight the representatives of civic democracy: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently how we will understand us within the framework of our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected lukas kaucky apparently does not recognize in the legend above, that this is the janousek influence entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor novel bem.
"voldemort" does nothing á' kaucky AND THE ONLY phrase he was suspected in the test is "the greatest hole Golf in Prague."
"It is the tunnel blanka" said kaucky and immediately adds: "But I know newspapers."
"I'm going to pay a" language courses, "he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel brezina but also lukas plachy, elected for the environment, know that the hole golf is the blanko tunnel.
The two Democrats know who is really voldemort and lukas plachy knows the place to find the character - about the meaning of "Go to the pastry."
"This is, I think, to go into a company," plachy is ready to guess that it is the headquarters of janousek societies.
In the same tone brezina recalls that derives its knowledge rather newspapers and not some vocabulary that it would use.
According to argôt candidates for tests there is no lexicon of social democracy.
"I advice with colleagues and it appears that we do not really something of this kind."
"We are saying the names sometimes using abbreviations and symbols," said Peter hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, that the party members call hulda.
"I called briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this," Karel brezina about the nicknames.
The Daily actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected weinert is Poppy for members of the party or the least friendly little old, the representative Miroslav pocket, which attracted the attention on him before the elections by fraud during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little joujou."
The nicknames are also the only admit work inside the party the Social Democrats.
It seems that hulinsky did not care hear hulda, but the daily akutel.cz has been another nickname for this president occurred.
"Club doctor of law" recalls allegedly that Petr hulinsky won the title of doctor of law judr.à the police academy in Bratislava.
The government aims to reduce the torture "witches," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, the women reported witches have similar features.
Rather they are part of the old generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
That becomes "Witch" is isolated not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man was very rarely that fate."
"We do not consider the young women in good health as they participate in the work and their children," says a sister who is in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The Local Government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure."
He published a pamphlet that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case involves a "problem."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the standard daily Die written about the inconvenience of education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbour of Burkina Faso, ammy Hemma 72 years, a woman died after being tortured by three women and one man and burned with oil they had sprayed.
It is the server of the BBC that reported this information.
Criminals claimed that it was the dim.
According to their oil used for anointing ritual version was emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, reported to be when the team went to "oust the bad spirit" of women.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a contractor to 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The eaters in human minds were always a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia not later than the past year has seen the president himself participate.
"The Gambian President dzammi, after the death of her aunt, has launched a broad witch hunt, reported to be participated in his death and would have sought also by black magic to kill the president."
"near shamans Guinea's come to the rescue, led to the farm presidential kanilai, under the protection of police and the president's personal guard, men and women at random dansdes villages of Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message to the organization."

The tenant of bakal: the poèles heat, he signed a higher rent.
An old man came out by way of imposing centre customers of the company rpg byty of "Baron coal" zdenek bakal, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
It was under the arm one with three new leases for three apartments: their own, that of his daughter and her son who is currently serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3,500 the son should address from next year for an apartment Second Class 2 + 1 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works by solid fuel," points on his son's new contract signing the man who has the power.
"But still I signed" he explains to motié angry and half resigned.
The civic association of rental apartments bytyokd.cz who described the nouelles conditions as "immoral and offensive," advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when will be issued a notice to explain the method to claim.
But the man react to this as a gesture of the hand.
"One said that, the other says something else" in fronçant eyebrows.
The region Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, that is what awaits most rental apartment in Czech Republic, which do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory."
Rpg waiting room in the street havirovska is one of four of the region Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m..
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call the clients.
A special button," rent 2011," was lit on the touch screen.
One pressure and a paper with a number of the aircraft fate.
You have no time to read your number "157" that number is already is light on the big screen in the topit the waiting room.
In a split second it is your turn.
After a short time, an elderly couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rent doesn't affect people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to resolve common problems such as all - Application of repairs, for insurance and other events.
Ostrava in the region, people of more than 44000 apartments in the portfolio of rpg receive the letters with the new leases in their mailbox for approximately half of November.
Rpg byty propose to rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The Special window for the new rent is open to the public since November 18.
"It works for nearly a week, so it is still in the test" addresses, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the customer is as a journalist.
The déragulation and the older apartments of minors bakal are a very sensitive issue local.
Vice President of Parliament and from the region Ostrava lubomir zaoralek Democrats in reported fairly steadily before the elections and it has been assigned the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They did not even changed a Board put... do in the WC, relieves introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mainly, the employees, retirees who come to ensure that they receive a discount on the new rent if they sign now as the rpg promised in a special offer.
It is a discount of half the rent that receive other loctaires which have signed a new contract before December 15.
But the window "deregulation" Street havirovaska is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"among the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," says the employee at the box office.
And yet rpg proposed both on its Web site that in the Windows of individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent is an independent tribunal for the decision.
It is not a question of threats, but only to inform on how unique and legitimate act legally," says rpg on its Web site.
"Here nobody will go to court" Believe one of the rpg employees byty and the man in the street outside the centre of clientele agreed with him.
"I 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 kroner to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feel uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. zaoralek in the media request that nobody sign and therefore the people expect," she says.
The rent regulation ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to rpg byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents are still not the simple level required for maintenance of the Fund for housing," said Pavel residential klimes, portfolio manager of the company rpg byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the fund for housing that makes the tenant in Anger is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 rpg was with the rents invest in the apartments, 4 billion in four years of 2011 has 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hung the ceiling in front of upholstered chairs of the waiting room of the street havirosvka, again, however some information marked in red.
'The rent increases in 2011 is 15 percent and for no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of rpg' apartments.
"And it will always be at more 7.50 Czech crowns the sq. m per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the portfolio of rpg.
"In such cases, there is an increase of very low amount actually 19.66 Czech crowns to sq. m," rpg.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
Rpg byty promised that deregulation will not cause a dramatic increase but gradual on 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money in the increase in rents, see the graph left for the apartments in the form of economies of heating - new windows and heating.
Those who signed the agreement on the rent increase have priority.

No one would have expected that also houses a mini nursery school color walls with all it takes - imaginative, furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, can reach the children of employees of design. architect
Projets-architectonique Arch. design. society where the workshops generated a large number of buildings in Brno, has found its mini kindergarten business since the first draft avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age to have children and it is important that women architects and heads of projects could return to work soon.
At the same time as labour contracts to decreased, the kindergarten is a bonus proposed to its employees by the arch. design. society within the framework of his social agenda.

Thanks to grants funding, to the tune of 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns. they were able to buy equipment and apparatus and after two years ensure qualified personnel, the operation.
After two years, the use of the funding of financing Arch. design. society has the obligation after 3 years of operating the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of The project lasted a year and is the economy rating company that has helped to make the request to staff.
The care of children is provided by a personnel, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher took care of child nursery children can go to school without age limit but they have more than three years for most.

It is not surprising that is a natural relationship of loyalty to the employer and employee.
Arch.design.s' is so registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this programme strengthens the HR marketing.
Bone home still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look in the inner gaudi.
The roof on the back of a prehistoric saurien, the stairs resembles a backbone of dinosaur and balconies of fish Gules open.
As is the house Casa battlo in Barcelona for the architect antoni gaudi.
Because of its local organic forms, the House has received from the nickname of house bone.
Wild organic forms and colours, unusual use of stones, tiles and mosaîque fragments, front recalling scales and all present curves, that is ypique for Art Nouveau antoni gaudi.
The front facade of the House held its lines of dream, pleasant colors and textures reminiscent of the nature and animals.
During a more detailed comment is geometry, the pace and order thought accurately.
In the night the facade becomes even more dramatic and ignited in such a way that the impression of brightness of colour is stronger.
The winding and torque also appears in the inner forms with the same measure.
Wood in waves executives copy of Windows, the balustrades, ornament, the doors and slats eye.
The House battlo which stands in the market eixample in the street passeig neighbourhood of gracia in number. 43, was born in the construction of a house in 1877 down of the architect Emilio Sala little.
Reconstruction has been for two years and the House finished in 1906.
The investor, Joseph battlo, a wealthy businessman, was first insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another any new gaudi but quickly accepted the idea of an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa battlo as house in multiple unit was not thought by gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that have emerged the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and use of the mosaîque for the facade.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work to the plans of the House Casa battlo began with a cooperation between jujol and gaudi success.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House of gaudi Casa mila and guell park in which there are other works of gaudi.
The premises have dubbed hot home just after its completion because of its organic forms bone "home."
Other specific, regarding the mechanism of opening windows called it "the House that baille."
It said that on top of the construction has a sword similar to that of St. George the pattern of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture construction contain hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought for the home a single system in its time, with central heating vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45 degrees inclination seems odd.
During the creation gaudi did not follow the instructions of then construction and has not left hinder by them.
At the beginning of the construction he received from the city, of course, the permits, knowing that the data related to the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after for finishing the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
He did not appeal, for example, members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction empiettent public on the sidewalk.
There was never any changes, but on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city and obtained satisfaction, Josep battlo asked permission to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to lower floors.
In the second floor gallery there was a common lounge and the third a bedroom and a private party of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery.
The full house of six floors is shared by a staircase in which you access until an independent roof terrace.
All the right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by walls curves.
Gaudi liaison also worked the modern concept of spaces.
The joint party may be related completely by opening the doors of shows and high society can communicate comfortably or are limit the private space for more intimate meetings.
The house with the reconstruction of gaudi received also new facades a toîture not traditional and two floors and more.
The game of gaudi with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which is decorated the courtyard and with the wells of lights.
The game on two colours gives a maximum of light in all stages of the House.
It took just to bet on the principle that the White reflête more than the dark that absorbs the sun's rays. Instead
The House Casa battlo which was recorded in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may visited by everyone.
The first floor of the house is the most splendid apartment on more spacious and accessible to the public.
Owners have decided to take this step in 2002 for the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they saw that this is a lucrative business and they have widened the scope of visits to Common Spaces and the attic including the roof terrace.
The price of entry into the monument is really not expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourism cardholders have 20 percent discount.
The amount is still above the price of entry gaudi in the other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with their turrets fantastic, you must quickly find a partner among the residents of the building and visit the home completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
No conspicuous framework, but the quality of the surface for bed, then the mattress and mattress give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course be complete smoothly to appeal to a concrete user.
During the several things are decisive choices:, weight, height, age, the health as well as the owner's sex.
The type of procedure in which we will place the mattress and the mattress is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the cottage where you never sleeps continually mattresses latex are not appropriate because they "Warm" gently.
They, moreover, a weighing more than the mattress polyurethane standards.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels to heart and if they remain solid, In addition, on a wall, they hold moisture. mold can also form.
The habit is also critical in the choice.
Who is the clear time abroad where it often uses mattresses very thick with a layer rammollissante, feel hardly well on a low and hard surface.
"This means that any hokeyistes returning from nhl complain that they cannot sleep there."
"for their shoulders tired, feet and ribs, foam mattress they needed with a layer rammollisante lazy."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for those who suffer from diabetes who have a disease of the nervous system that will assume evil" the information "joints and skin," said sylva adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why a few years ago the mattress with moss lazy won the hokeyistes and other clients.
"Now everything works well, tempur, Italian magnifex but also the Czech tropico have appropriate for example of mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy from nhl to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
She optimizing its strength and its form in the heat absorbed or are adapting to the heat of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you do not return in the night after a difficult match.
You sleep just better.
Foam lazy also works as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress in terms of your size, add the length of feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two seats should be 90 cm in all 180 cm.
To the beds in one place, the singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
"However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on his back you should ask the hands of comfortably with the elbows slightly bent. Helena prokopova, President of the Association of bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators dedicated to the issue for several years to a healthy sleep and ergonomics furniture and the teaches in the schools.
For a bed to two seats each Needs Its Own mattress and mattresses, however, therefore attention during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you remain only to turn the mattress at different levels and that is not possible at all levels of bed.
Mattresses Moss should have a minimum height of 14, the mattress spring at least 15 cm, it "to the layer of form and venting at least three centimetres.
"to touch or sitting on the mattress you do not feel the springs," warns héléna prokopova.
Each mattress request a specific type of mattress.
The lit-sommier, when the mattress and the mattress are united as siamoises sisters, has nothing to do in the bedroom.
Mattresses ventilated very badly; it must not wash, what is done auhourd' today.
And as the night it transpires normally 0.2 to 0.75 the sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large, and blocked sieve.
For that experts refuse to advertise on a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee for life.
But his but.
And for a Council of experience on the part of vendors: one 120/140cm mats,, to give the surface of the mattress, hygiene or washed but add a mattress protection rather than vouspouvez easily withdraw and wash.
And even though today it is common for manufacture of Coatings with zipper for the whole thing, that is to say that after the opening was two parties, for washing and the size of a washing machine that is very important. But the manipulation of the great models, and for one person becomes when they cut a fight between a weight and a heavyweight on a ring.
You have in your bed a rigid board instead of a mattress?
Never!
Maximum for a visitor bed for a single night.
However équipez do, if there are no holes ventilation and use the mattress spring with a minimum height of 70 cm with springs in bags, of Germany taschenfederken and a layer of ventilation.
A mattress polyurethane should not be part of a bed of this kind.
For the box slats unique position with latex. slats, mattresses or called sandwiches, perhaps a combination of latex and coconut, are the ideal but this will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where slats are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress at several positions it should not take mattress spring because it does not meet the change of position.
Besides the adjustment of the rigidity of slats also can be installed what we call a cradle of shoulder.
It is a special liaison slats and getting pressure even to defer the slide for the shoulder of the sleeper "fits well."
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back," this is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by manufacturers of mattresses which for the "male" began to use a rammollissante area in the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they provide a softer pelvic surface again.
For the most difficult client there are box wings or boilers with what is called a suspension multiforce.
The pressure is discharged into more points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, when you use a bad pillow, large and inflated air on sound mattresses and mattress," the "vanishes.
The basic rule is a pillow simple: the pillow must support the head and its points must reach only shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50x60 cm that the Scandinavian by exmple prefer.
When one is lying on the side, pillow to upgrade, with the cradle shoulder of the mattress or the rammollie area in the mattress the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first base of straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or of mixtures.
The trend is also the mattress bio.
Pétrôle based raw materials, from which it manufactures polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use precisely soybeans.
"The qualifier bio for mattresses means that the heart is made using natural products," said Petr vasicek of society tropico more.
Natural materials are also used for coatings mattresses; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules involving perfume of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the plants in order to extract the mattress cover absorbs the heat and cool down the body," cooled "Man," Heat "coatings women.
The excerpt of red pepper accelerates the bloodstream and is therefore more warm for the weaker sex.
The current favorite?
Foam mattresses made cold, she is more pores with a cellular structure so disrupted more elastic respirante than the standard polyurethane and more.
The combination of various rigidities of cold gives foam mattresses polyzones who know exactly where is the head, the lower back and feet.
You pay a mattress quality from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is gumotex who reached the top.
Save for the mattress and the mattress is not simple.
We can have from time to time in the framework of special actions by the manufacturers and producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Such as the company magniflex proposing mattresses duofreeze from moss smart memory sewn onto the surface for 11990 wreaths.
Can obviously take the second free.
The era of foam lazy or viscoélastiques with an open cellular structure and a great thickness was started with the tempur at a pace "cosmic matters."
It started as material for NASA parceque astronauts early suffered enormous load factors.
The tempur is rammollit heat and is strengthening, On the contrary, cold.
Adapts so perfectly to the human body hot and distributes an optimum pressure him.
It is for this ideal against evil slept and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Moss viscoélastiques are used not only for the mattress but also for the special health products like cushions for the feet that alleviate the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example the foam eucathermc or twinsaver or the same kind.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly requested by parents who want to watch their children.
The fear for their child brings more and more people to think monitor them through a GPS.
The system, established at the beginning to seek cars could very well be used to help plot the movement of people and in some cases as by exmple that of the small anicka janatkova.
The device is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a shows.
The case of the small anicka moved a large number of people and they have started to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to say to all that it is not spying but only one another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," says Petr pilin macro weil society which is one of the suppliers of tracing equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting on the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are really customers who buy the product for security reasons, pilin said.
He said children should always know for what purpose is used "the box" and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana bockova, drew attention that if he does not want to cover him such a thing, it débarassera.
"and even the smallest can show great creativity express when it comes to getting rid of something when they do not want to be under control."
"mobile phones, which can be cut as these devices tracing, have already prompted the parents to lengthy delays," says bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of aircraft to help in case of aggression is highly debatable.
"If it is a kidnapping prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device that can locate him."
"Now is the telephone."
"When will develop AIDS of tracing, they, criminals, will seek them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will still ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
But still that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert cech RC monitoring society, which provides services tracing for both cars and people, claims to have this kind of device can help, even if it was destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The aircraft can be preset so that it is in regular issue after a period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it still leaves the last position of the person concerned."
'the more expensive equipment also have a inclinometer immediately reported the position of the person who slipped and was in a position extended without moving," says cech.
He said smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can provide a comparable service after formatted with a special prologiciel.
The current problem of tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those that we are in pendant of the size of a box of matches or the smaller telephones.
We can always lose them.
According to the company pilina macro weil, that is why the tests are ongoing to make common digital devices that resemble watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible aggressor will not recognize the tracing system."
"Or else he will report after a certain time, which will be given to the police a little more time," he added.
That the tracing system is developed in the form of bracelet or pendant, it utilisiera always the same technology as to build cars.
It is a combination of purchasing systems of a position through the GPS, which is widely used in autonavigation and a function of a mobile phone that alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has both of detonating cord that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with. But it can only take two years.
The army has purchased for 445 km fuses used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence in had bought 224 km.
The army has therefore reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of fuses is two to four years.
The army has purchased carrying stv group detonating cord to the company for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the achât a huge amount of detonating cord to MF dnes used by soldiers in 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of Reserve to hold made by the army pyrotechniciens, MF dnes contacted, it is that even the generals, officers with a personal command, or both Secretaries of household should have an annual exercise to explosives.
Alexander vondra, Minister of Defence and vlastimil picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cord.
Has this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the reserves of the army could provide for 10 years.
If it is true that for basic training of each new professional it is enough to more than 2 million of detonating cord, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase also assured - with the consumption of special units and Engineering - of reserves for 225 years mentioned.
Yet the rapid intervention brigade soldiers have recently complained to the Minister vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their firing handguns and that the meetings are limited because of the need for money.
A lack of linen body we do not speak.
"And I do not take the lead if they buy home so much of detonating cord."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the army is a good one that we try as traders to please," said the commercial director of STV Group Jan decky.
Jan pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argued the achât of hundreds of km of detonating cord by the fact that the army will "munitions" in this reserve for 10 years.
Jan decky STV group reported however only four years of life of detonating cord and the pyrotechniciens only two years of the police and the army.
"If they are totally stored in deposits, this can go up to four years," said one who does not want his name published because of the criticism of the army.
The deadline of life past, each item should be tested to see if it is ethical and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
The department's argument is a discount due to the amount for 445 km cordeux reports.
"They took 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said the spokesman pejsek which is the interpreter of the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cord pyrotechniciens police which neutralize the ammunition from the Second World War or the ones after the Soviet army, DOES NOT EXCEED 1500 metres.
And the police still control only the quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
It was established for security reasons pyrotechniciens and longer in order to obtain more flexibility in the more modern types of detonating cord and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence has today major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact Czechoslovak when the army with two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, cap on the Rhine.
That awaits the Czech army in a few years that MF dnes contacted: Defeating hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cord it buys today "cheap."
Until today I benefits from contacts I achieved with the competition.
The sale franchise from his hotel has certainly helped lukas pytloun entrepreneur individual winners of the competition for the seat.
The winner of the competition for the best individual contractor for the past year has been lukas pytloun, contractor 28 years.
His adventure towards the success is like in a film.
Lukas pytloun loved travel.
And abroad, he realized that to libérec it lacked a quality accommodations at a reasonable price.
Of its savings on what he had won when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he purchased a small apartment building of 5 half demolished.
Knowing that he was a student in the third year of graduate school, it was a courageous.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," said Lucas pytloun.
He began has rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
It restoring the benefit in the building that he forged in pension with 54 beds.
Since then, its action of contractor was opened to libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants in style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
Most comfortable of them was until recently The four stars pytloun design hotel.
This year he came another same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in ostrova U tise where we sold our concept of frankness and other candidates for the franchise hotels pytloun have shown," The number 1 entrepreneurs in the past year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a hotel on a large scale victory in the competition of the Entrepreneur of the Year has served, adds pytloun with appreciation.

"People recognize me in the streets, often félicitaient me, and I must say, that it was very nice," he recalls.
He recommends the participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He uses until today its contacts and knowledge that he could not get a different way.
"with those I met with the help I began to trade regularly.
According to him, the renowned linked the success has also had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I see among them especially the loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my own work, but the result of a good job of us all together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had in farmet.
The euphoria of The victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
With the objective of farmet winner has the worst behind.
Those who got the price to slovansky dum for first place in the competition for the firm of the year organized by vodaphone last year was Karel zdarsky the owner of the company farmet.
The Board has recognized the efforts with which he transformed a workshop of tools to ceska skalice in a firm in turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the prize has also encouraged not only me my my colleagues and increased our confidence to combat competition," said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to Karel zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic bathtub.
Not long after they have begun to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
It has become after 18 years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the lay audience after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to really better brand awareness farmet but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they work with a company that has received the highest success in his country of origin," said Karel zdarsky.
But the past year e has not gone to farmet only ldans the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company had been made from the economic performance of 2008 and in part by 2009.
And precisely in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts new equipment and technologies.
"Obviously we have not escaped to this situation."
"The turnover fell 40 percent, and we had limit our production and even dismiss," explains Karel zdarsky.
A sustainable society must know that from time to time we must take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation properly and maintained results recipients even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with a training and Research Centre, endowments have strengthened the presentation of the company in salons-expositions and won the main international awards in the national exhibitions," said zdarsky.
All we believe that the crisis is behind them.
Affires figures dating back and also with them the number of employees.
"The new winner I want this nice feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel zdarsky.
The investigation mad that eliminates regulations.
The investigation of the absurdity of the year for the fourth time is a part of the clan affairs.
Certain rules absurd have been removed.
Unpalatable the winner of this year's investigation into the absurdity of the year was an obligation to provide online in the offices of documents that employees may obtain.
More than a third of 4,000 voters have voted for it.
For example, the administration of Social Affairs asked an abstract paper records trade while the official can be obtained by two mouse clicks.
Things change through the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will no longer extract the commercial register for controls on insurance payments," said Czech Jana buranova, spokesman of the administration of social insurance, cssz.
Highlight all regulations and decrees that companies and contractors must meet in the Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the absurdity of the year.
This investigation is still for the fourth time this year a part of the clan Affairs organized by hospodarske noviny and still more popular.
If last year 3000 voting appeared, it is at least 4,000 this year who made their votes.
And this is not surprising, there are in our countries most various legal obligations which are only impede the company, and, thus, more and more.
"We are perhaps the number of documents needed for the tax declarations at the top in the world," says Karel havlicek of the Association of small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship becomes a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world the situation in Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is 74 37th place with regard to the conditions for the company, or 8 seats compared to last year.
The competition of the absurdity of the Year has been put in place for the first time in 2006 and continues each year on the same scenario.
Anyone can be reported each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to September deadline before the closing of the competition.
To realize there are the Web site www.firmaroku.cz. then, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and leaves the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the largest number of votes was declared winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is 100, or more precisely 105 décrêts and regulations that have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by contractors but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the finalists' competition, so "among the nominees is for example the requirement that the highways and expressways pay tolls maintenance vehicles, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, repeignent two offices and two washrooms every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins in early November on the place venceslas in Prague, is part of a happening regularly involving leaders of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva svobodova, director of the Association for the small and Medium Enterprises of Czech Republic or Petr kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
'economic prosperity cannot function when the state set of âtons for that in the legs of entrepreneurs and my goal is to remove each year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicates the company," said Martin kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove the décrêts absurd is not an empty gesture.
In 2007, which did not appeal to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office to the individual company at the location of the company, the intention to attend an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This obligation was eliminated with the ammendement individual of the law on the company.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare the labour office service a trip for a foreign employee in 30 days, was abolished by the draft law on what is called the Green Card.
And everything is OK until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the décrêt for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their offices, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health the year dernière-l' requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.

To the Fund for the land in Plzen, police made arrests during an open competition
In the building of the Fund for the land to Plzen anticorruption, police made the arrests in recent days.
The detectives were handcuffed to the local contractor and trader in property lubos. G.
He had tried to manipulate precisely a public tender for the settlement of a restitution claim in such a way that the proposed site is obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police pursues a person for insider trading in the tender and a public competition." said to the newspaper pravo Plzen the DPP antonie zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more details because the investigation is ongoing.
The police have released after 24 hours this contractor 46 years.
For how it might affect an open competition, one can only speculate in light so little information official.
Pravo has a question, the spokesman of the Fund land lubomira cerna said that the police had really made an arrest in Plzen on a separate place of work, and this during the open competition.
"It was a client and in no case of an employee, she said.
The open competition in cerna is real name "call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the law on the land" and is put in place when occur several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These people have, within the framework of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions that must be resolved before being announced the value of the land."
"under the proposed fee a ranking of buyers is put in place and the Fund of land then transferred the ground to the person who proposed the rights the Fund's highest," said the spokesman.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information on those who had registered to the appeal and as he himself is also a person beneficiary because purchasing a large number of claims for refunds, he had proposed to the candidates for the ground not to participate in the competition.
And he probably cashed by the fact to withdraw.
Which might explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above standards in fdt, fund land.
He appeared in the case of the former chief of fdt Vaclav sankot which was criminally prosecuted for publishing of land that had already issued the decision of setting up a construction.
Precisely lubos G. had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place where should be built the artery access to the industrial zone in borske pole.
Later he exchanged with the mayor for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far superior.
The mayor was obliged to accept because it would place the construction jeopardized by a freeze of land.

However all suppliers have decreased electricity prices Given the sensitive to encourage the production of renewable energy development, including the photovoltaic cells.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people most in need to heat and thus have the greater consumption.

Although electricity and gas increased across the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from town to town.
It is mainly the biggest municipalities in planning the price increase.

These are beverages that bring the most often those who saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are being treated at the hospital for recidivism is not the exception.
This is the experience of physicians facing similar cases admissions children departments of hospitals.
Fashion "beer or the wines are no longer because it takes time to be saoûl."

Before working to horovice since last year, he was in motol where he held ten years especially in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren drunken wide surroundings completely.
"A young girl was hospitalized and four times
"It acommencé his career to 12 years when she was taken with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in blood with a mixed with ecstasy," described the doctor this particularly important.
"She was in exhibitions of holesovice park in a party."
"What is interesting is that it appeared not bizarre to the mother that her daughter was absent 48 hours" said that the director of the department.
It is precisely the satisfaction of parents or their tolerance well out of the ordinary about the fact that their offspring are involved IN THE BEVERAGE which are the main cause of child development of alcoholism.
According to the experts, but it does not speak of addiction, in its strict sense, for children.

In addition to the children who sit and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite under pélikan seasonal three waves with which you can count: the day of witches, the Scots Saint and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink in disgust after poor results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I lived in the day witches an admission of 7 children drunk at once," said pélikan.
The child drunk who spent the night at the hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision paradoxically is in a better position than that which went home and suffering the aftermath of the "hangover."
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose were removed by an infusion of and nutrients that the organization needs.
"They are better off for such as they spend a good night and a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised by their location," pélikan knowing that from time to time that striker the spirits of patients with at least the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance and hospital intensive care on bed goes up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I use this as a means of education in cash to these children how their drunk cost and that they could spend all summer seasonal work to pay one evening," added pélikan.
However, he said, the health insurance companies in their management in decline, which should recover from parents expenses related to care, do not treat cases of child drunk.

An index longer than The Ring is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the ring are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
Surprising is the conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative finger length is simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for the men before 60 years," proclaimed the coauthor of the study Ros eeles, Professor at the Institute for the cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine what men should undergo testing of prostate cancer, including by combining with the genetic risk or other aggrâvants factors such as antécedents family health, eeles added.
During the period of 1994-2009 it followed with his colleagues in Great Britain more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients healthy and at the same time nearly three thousand men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of his right hand shorter than the ring.
For them and for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, was found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring the risk is however dropped to 33 percent for men before 60 years reduced risk reached 87 percent.
The report of length of two fingers cities - formed during prenatal - notes of different levels of sex hormones faced by the child in the uterus.
Was less testosterone is a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone development aid prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur vacla space, renowned geneticist Czech and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said in ctk that he is aware of this study reported to be, but that he did not think that the relationship between the finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated."

THE DIRECTOR GENERAL, Bernd Wagner, said: "frankfurt-niederrad as an important location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance for global enterprise as fujitsu.
The new move to a large company within the region received yesterday the joy of winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of Economic Affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank, CDU, said that once again, a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is a "special profession of faith on the location of."
Fujitsu agrees to the city and its implementation is an important impetus for niederrad.
The mayor of bad homburg, Michael korwisi, the Greens, regrets the decision of fujitsu.
Early management has informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr. korwisi.
However, friendly relations would not have changed the difficulties of computer manufacturer against the owner of the building of the place marienbader.
In the end, the economic reasons were decisive.
The challenge now is to avoid a place if exceptional remains vacant for long.
"I hope that the owner and donor building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the place of the city hall building, used by the company fujitsu so far and the neighbouring vertical "small," as well as the rest of the place marienbad buildings, part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
Result of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entrance of the city was created between the station and the town hall. It was under criticism, not only because of the impressive surfaces that served previously in part of parking spaces, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company investment rating and advice, feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, start Amadeus, as well as fujitsu, at the time still associated with Siemens computer manufacturer, moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German group specialized in Frankfurt immobilien-chancen acquired the buildings occupied by fujitsu at the same time as the Property Fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon real estate investments its based in Madrid.
The group fujitsu whose headquarters in Tokyo sees itself as the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it puts computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch office in the region of rhin-main is one of the most important in Germany: fujitsu has certainly far more employees in Munich.
The branch, fujitsu technology solutions, moved from bad homburg for frankfurt-niederrad. Other subsidiaries present in this site are fujitsu services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have hired in the building Astro park.
This old complex of 20 years, which is named his plan into a star, among other houses the headquarters of the Confederation of electronics and electrical engineering.
Expulsion of server by Amazon - threats against Mr. assange
Wikileaks faces more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may mask political pressure incurred after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Apparently the founder of wikileaks, Mr. assange, stayed in England.
In the United States, the site wikileaks is attacked with more force.
The Group of cyber-activistes "wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted in America and is now seeking a host in Europe so far.
Meanwhile, the prominent US Senator Joe lieberman, called upon other countries and companies to boycott wikileaks.
And the founder of wikileaks, Julian assange, who is wanted by Interpol, stayed probably in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"wikileaks excluded from server Amazon."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," indicated Wednesday local time on the cyber-activistes originally revelations via the social network Twitter.
Recently, the cyber-entreprise, Amazon, had removed the documents of wikileaks of its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activistes have used the Amazon Web service, AWS, in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, wikileaks continues his revelations: 'great, our dollars are now spent to deal with people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem for Amazon," they should stop to sell books."
CNN television, citing the office of Mr. liebermann, reported that Amazon has forbidden wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation by the Senator's staff Joe lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian."
"I wish that Amazon took this measure earlier given the previous publications by wikileaks of classified information," the senator said.
Meanwhile, Mr. liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"wikileaks monstrous acts illegally, and unscrupulous. It endangers our national security and endangering the lives around the world," according to a statement by the independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help wikileaks to distribute the documents stolen."
The founder of wikileaks, Mr. assange, who was wanted by the authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent," the Australian of 39 years live in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is found.
The cyber-activiste has consistently qualified intrigue orchestrated by detractors the charges against him by Sweden.
The spokesman of wikileaks, kristinn hrafnsson, said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian assange."
That is why assange particularly fears for his safety, said hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike huckabee, demanded that the responsible the revelations made by wikileaks be pursued and implemented for treason.
In Canada, the head of Government adviser Stephen Harper said on television, obviously ironic, Mr. assange "should be killed" and that Mr. Obama could use a "hawk."
Meanwhile, a controversy occurred between the White House and Mr. assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman of US president, Mr. Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and disclosed recently, of engaging in espionage.
"I don't know exactly why we must look at the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," says Dr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of the country are far more important than the claims of a Web site."
The U.S. government is now completely to scrutiny the protection of its databases.
According to a press release of the White House, Mr. Russell through, deputy director of the center of the fight against terrorism, was appointed to lead fight against leaks.
Mr. through is responsible for developing "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after disclosure of diplomatic cables in wikileaks.
The White House also has the desire to verify the means by which the whole administration and protects the information exchange.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that he wanted to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by the revelations of wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to get in touch with them," said the State Department spokesman, Philip Crawley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of ice
At the "gelato" university of Bologna, we prepare the confectioners ice to best seasons of the year.
Three days the introductory organized for the benefit of future glaciers was a very successful and attracted visitors from across the world.
In fact, where all the ice?
Glacier and The ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German, the candy maker of ice somewhat dated, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian art manufacturing ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream the showcase Chilled with the help of a spatula, available in the gopher and then begins to sell it.
To find out, it does not need to go to anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who want to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "gelato-university" of the Italian firm carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières Founded the University of ice in 2003 for the ice cream out of its machinery everywhere meet Italian high ideals.
The introductory three days organized for the benefit of future glaciers had a very successful and attracted visitors from around the world.
Are also offered special courses on the chocolate and ice covering several days. Similarly, private practice sessions are held in the glacerie.
In full midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply may reach their smooth desire on the ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky come to California is your arts education, professor of the slow food movement. He wants to propose a future European product quality of the industrial countries of the ice.
Berlin anke is business management consultant and she wants, after a few years, learn something unique to the occupation hard on the nerves.
Two young Egyptian dream to open a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another come from Brazil would improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because his kids love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari outlines participants with the ideal characteristics of ice perfect.
Is critical not only the good taste, but also the flexibility silky and good consistency.
However, Luciano do not forget during training the icing on the cake of the superstructure national and, in general, South Italian: "The ice is simply the best: sacred and she still retains a dose of laughter."
The first step in the manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, ice cream, milk powder, sugar and in a large blender stabilisers that heats just 85 degrees by an electronic programme, then cooled immediately to four degrees.
He then opened a tap installed on the machine: it leads to a cream white basic pasteurized milk, Foundation of all kinds of ice.
The trainer is immediately besieged to question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizing?
How can unleash the pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact being mislead by the spirit of the times.
Who speaks only ice "manufactured from natural ingredients" may have even used stabilizers: most often a natural product, such as flour guar obtained from guar bean seed.
Obviously it is possible to make ice without use of stabilizing, just to be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapsed and the customer croquera nothing other than ice pellets.
Some changes to the basic mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the flavours.
The master Luciano differentiates between the ingredients that one acquires in the radius fruit or Confectionery supermarket.
In addition, there are the powder and pasta.
"suppliers try all of you pass dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Or in the revenues of fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in the ice cream, made from the mass of white basis that, by adding egg becomes a cream yellow and is, when combined with cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants over should proceed to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invite them from time to time to manufacture four types of ICE: vanilla, chocolate, the Moka and the chestnut with or without basic eggs in the mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatics, more purees fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The ice at hazelnuts does not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it is composed largely of crop.
The ice at the kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less than stabilizing.
"Only a balanced mix is properly the taste of a lens," said Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise of calculation: using the fishing puree with lots of sugar, the amount of sugar needs to be reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for the ice lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit, vintners use it to measure the degree of oechsle in the grape must.
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice does not require, like before, so many physical intervention.
It is not only the Automatic Machine manufacturing base of the mass that help.
There is also a system in which we waged simultaneously the mixture of ice to make available buttery and reduced to negative temperatures.
In spite of all the automatisations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbouille fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, éclabousse his fellow students when control of the immense bowl blender has eluded them.
The master Luciano is of the view that a "incident that may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that charts the culture of genetically modified plants has the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Group of Experts testbiotech which is considered an independent institute for assessing the impact of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are clear," said Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph then, director of testbiotech.
There are reports that the chairman of the Group of Experts EFSA for genetically modified crops, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts EFSA in animals are under contract with the lobby ILSI.
The program is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked EFSA's contribution to the development of test requirements for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, in a clear conflict of interest, according to the criticism made by Mr. then.
Developed verbatim, by paragraphs, meet the requirements in animals positions of the pressure group ILSI and are therefore the mark of the industry that, in fact, would be controlled by the authorities installed to Parma in Italy.
This is the second time that testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A senior official of the EFSA has recently joined without conditions or transitional period the Agribusiness Group Switzerland syngenta. Consequently, it has changed sides.
A short time ago, even the central radio of Germany - mitteldeutsche rundfunk, Mdr had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's authority responsible for monitoring and the industry lobby, which has aroused suspicion of both the German Federal Environmental Agency that MEPs.
However, the EFSA does not tolerate the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion shows that we are making all reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are a good professional quality.
We do not prohibit experts working for the EFSA to establish contacts with the industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he worked for the International Institute for the life sciences, international Life Sciences Institute in animals, ILSI, based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum comprising experts who belong, among others, science, industry and to assess the risks of biotechnology policy without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr. then disapprove the fact that genetically modified crops are accepted without any food in animals and test that we have not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize at Field" says then cause.
The current practice is to test only proteins isolated and not the entire GM plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If we don't seek the risks, how can we discover them?" asked Mr. then accuser in tone.
That is also the view of Ms. Angelika hilbeck.
This scientific conducts research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working on the Polytechnic of Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector increasingly influence or try to discredit the scientific criticism.
Therefore, there are still barely researchers who are not related to companies.
In the view of businesses, the critical studies should not be published.
Ms. hilbeck stated that "the industry control security research."
A record of stone
Uli gsell had obtained a total of about 400 kilo.
Monday afternoon, she was before the station of Stuttgart with its tube back.
There were event.
It was.
History is known: in September, excavators came and had started to demolish a large part of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the project s21, the transformation of the Central Station of Stuttgart in an underground station costing billions.
A large part of the wing was ruined when the demonstration led to the arrest of construction.
Broken into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The muschelkalk, limestone areas of crailsheim, a tender and stone coarse poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. gsell is a sculptor 43 years living in ostfildern.
He has procured fragments.
"The stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He said enthusiastically: "A modest rock and cheap, simple and land."
He affirmed that in the cutting to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
Does not know yet what he will do the fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli gsell too.
Traces of stones of Stuttgart leads to a French former army Ammunition Depot in a forest near tubingue, where rongen manual has built its empire of stones.
This man of old stone 44 years of trades.
He purchased all the stones from the demolition occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were or not broken or if they disappear in the discharge" he says in his office in a hut, who was once a guard post.
He said that he was subjected to insults and threats in September when the newspaper had reported that it had bought the rest of the northern wing at the demolition company.
But it has negotiated during days with the opponents of s21 project.
And he explained that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project s21 subsequently took one of the parallélépipède stone, averaging 80 kilos valued at $6.50 and 14 euros.
Some the Guard as a souvenir in while also hoping to make it in a reconstruction.
Full rongen acquired 500 tonnes, 25 cargoes of a truck.
About half are still long packed in the forest, the remainder being sold.
Owners of landscape gardens, gardeners, individuals.
THEY CAME FROM everywhere and took away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart has long been transformed into "mäuerle" or limitations grass beds.
"In fact, this is nothing in particular" Stone said Mr. rongen.
"Does eut-été this component policy."
He enters his car any land, made the round of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law it abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before addressing subsequently computer and ultimately to become a carrier.
And a fan of stones.
It stores 40000 tons.
He raised are treasures everywhere in Germany.
It is the largest merchant ancient stones.
Is suppress. strongly
Stones of sand carved with art are fixed on the snow.
"Previously, they were part of marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favourite stone."
It takes the path up through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger - sand brick red, karlsruhe previously, part of the station.
And so on.
"quaint travertine."
The parallélépipède was once part of the Forum of neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Across the snow stones and stories, the travertine cannstatt from the police district, granite reddish from the Cathedral of Saint blasien, the tephra from the heilbronn hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. rongen believe that once the stones were carved by hand and displaced using hoists simple and carts pulled by cattle, it becomes very respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in room."
It has not become rich, much less wealthy.
But the carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, tailors of stones, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass and a gardener blower settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," says the waste recycler.
Soon, he will be in Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Fight talent to win the senior potential
The counter is strong attendance.
16 students are to buy salmon rolls of the tomato sauce and blancs-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen called students in design and mechanical engineering at a workshop.
Within the framework of a kind of competition, they talk trade on the future with the developers of VW's car, and, by the way, know the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go the body to body in the competition to find best brains and herself, as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: most talented recruit graduates as much as possible in the chambers before they enter the job market and they are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements concerning the performance of their students, we try to identify the exceptional talents in the projects practices and the loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of brauschweig the automotive group amadoue talent.
A young lady of service personnel pens, candy and sharing of cards carrying the logo of Volkswagen.
She speaks of the calendar training courses and jobs to young talents students; it shows them roads to access to the compound of the group.
It is nico Technical University of Braunschweig saddle is responsible for the project started with Volkswagen.
For him, there is mutual benefits for both sides," the students come into contact with the industry and more experience."
"About the Volkswagen group, he may hear the students, focus on serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"Previously, the focus was more on the professional project," says saddle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become even more bitter.
In many areas, the companies can no longer select their staff with a screen on a host of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and especially courting the highly skilled labour.
It is mainly the engineering graduates from channels that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German engineers vdi, more than 40,000 engineers posts remained vacant in October.
And on the basis of the vdi, the vacuum on posts Engineer will expand again.
Novel dykta go hunting talents on behalf of KPMG accounting, auditing firm, and Council.
He organized costly events aimed at the recruitment of talent, such as the race cruise kpmg-race, a species rallye-papier competitors must find their way through the GPS coordinates.
The business will send eight promising students next year so they travel in this way the United States.
Participants can collaterally visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the company.
Who should participate is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the crop of candidates will depart for the United States.
According to Mr. dykta, the means used in pursuit of the high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want emerge batch through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent scout that is Mr. dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until now, we have been in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to extend their requests to our company." he says soon.
Outside the amadouement direct performed in the campus, small and medium enterprises utilize very traditional participating in trade fairs where they are engaged in hunting brains.
"We try to reach the graduates attending trade shows."
"For example, the Salon of solar technologies," says Ms. sitha stübe, director of human resources in solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company located in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. stübe is aware of the problems related to the injury.
Currently, 35 posts are under competition on the site of the company.
"At this moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It is expensive and time consuming," he says?
Another means of establishing contact is via the university professors.
Solarworld established cooperation with different institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"teachers indicate that the student has the ability to perform training courses or write his draft end of study in us."
Of solar expensive advertising campaigns have announced among professionals.
That is why the company tries to its advertisement highlighting other qualities: personalized environment, flat and communication easy hierarchy.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," supports Mrs stübe, Chief of staff.
Long ago that money is no longer the primary role in the job search.
The flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are the other factors.
According to a study by the Institute great place to work, solarworld occupies the 55th place among the Top 100 Employers of Germany.
The Institute is a table of annual honour of German employers.
To this end, he questioned the collaborators on their satisfaction with their work and its context watching the conditions of employees.
The Chief of Staff Ms. stübe hope that this investment will improve the image of the company to job seekers.
"I think that the candidates rely mainly on external assessments regarding a potential employer," she says.
Wolf reiner kriegler German Academy deba, deutscher employ brand Akademie, deba advises companies to build a good reputation as an employer with a long term strategy.
He advises clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. kriegler, it means before any internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to go attractive is through his own staff," he says.
That is, according to the jargon used in the domestic sector, the branding strategy, i.e. the creation of the image of the employer in its workforce.
"The staff met are the best messengers."
When its employees are well treated and that they identify with the company, they are all alone advertising their employer of friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if we played in a band," says Dr. kriegler.
Obama is halting the new oil wells
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Southeast state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Government of Washington made a similar ban a ban and, thus, definitively abolished its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new wells are as yet banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
This is the explosion, in April, the drilling rig "Deepwater Horizon" which is at the root of the strict ban. It must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident that claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and of this sector, had indicated that it would allow the drilling of new wells in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution to save the U.S. dependence on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil slick in the Gulf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of billions, is at the centre of charges.
A Commission of Inquiry established by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling freeze imposed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, oil groups had immediately submitted requests on new drilling projects.
With more stringent control measures and more stringent security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent control authority, which has discredited after many accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms in depth.
Meanwhile, Obama has announced the would remove the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas groups.
Actors in this sector are now publicly warn against the fact that the rate of food in the Gulf would be much lower than is the case so far.
"The Government's objective is to stop the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector" as the result of a current survey conducted in the area by the audit firm bdo, before the drilling ban issued Wednesday.
Moreover, the American enery alliance deplores the uncertainty in this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulations."
Investment granted in support of new projects have been delayed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is dry
Running water in rivers is oiled brown; it has a similar to that which exists in the smell gas station: because of a leakage, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed Ogoniland in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine akpobari has a good intention.
"In the event you exhaust not," quips the environmental activist to journalists to calm them: "You today still enough oil sludge before the lens of water."
The Nigerian 37 years tried to photograph a young driven into the muddy water up to the chest, and the drag fat around the: this seems almost beautiful scene in the glow of water to the colour of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement full of brown patches of crude oil.
On the bank of the river bodo-jetty, Esther badom said that, once she collected large shrimp by buckets here.
But meanwhile calm waters have completely exhausted.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil has bounced of a pipeline which exploded in the vast wetland.
The fishermen living nearby the small town of bodo must now rowing for six hours to reach the Ogoni waters: the country located in the heart of the Niger delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full range of devastation is plain to see when it spans mangrove swamps afflicted by streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat cracks water chestnut cradingue. Anyone who leaves his hand the withdraw any covered with oil.
The mangrove roots of small emerge from the ground as isolated sticks of licorice. palm trees are woefully hang their palms.
Sought in vain to swarms of birds, as it usually meets in the wetlands, as soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of past that resembles a gas station by the smell it.
"What is happening here is war against the environment" says Mr. celestine akpobari from an air sad: "Life is characterized by a constant danger in relation to health."
Comparing the war is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers have penetrated here; the first was organized resistance in the 1980s by the writer Ken saro-wiwa. it was executed later. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the Ogoni homecoming is prevented this company: while more than 2 million barrels of oil are pumped daily through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines in the whole of the delta region, three times great Ogoni as Switzerland, the country's oil fields are untapped oil, because the situation is too unstable for this group.
Every few hundred metres supports, which stand in the water of steel as bizarre sculptures: is very affectionately "Christmas Trees" Heads of boreholes.
They have up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion until marker.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time cubes, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years. Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that was leaked into the sea during the accident on super-pétrolier "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Who must bear responsibility for environmental pollution persistent? The answer to this question has divided the actor.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and the siphonage pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. environmentalists for their part view the head of drilling and pipelines explosions punctured as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner criticized the group shell to apply standards in Nigeria mainly less stringent than anywhere else in the world: only the rate of "failures of pipelines is even higher than alleures."
Emerging some forms of mangroves in a place that, Afar, similar to an abandoned workshop, full of/or oil resulting and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and/or oil resulting covered up the neck.
A fire recently under one of the many tons that intermittently related to pipes and scattered without reason on the site should be isolated: a small illegal refinery.
Is Heat in the crude oil barrel for several hours, said Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a vessel through pipes, then, at the end of the practice drops of kerosene fall and one gets finally diesel.
Thus, Michael and his four colleagues produced daily drums 300 litres of diesel: "We reported 34,000 naira," about 22 dollars.
Residents of the Delta to take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners may sell at a price cheaper than the ridiculously low of just 40 euro cents per liter of diesel: because they receive free their raw material.
It is offered by the "protective" that puts the network of pipelines in Ogoni breaks throughout the country. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part very inconsequential temporarily the raw material stored is purified illegally: the organized crime networks that are also among its members of senior politicians and military, provided the lion's share in the tankers and the selling on the world market.
The militant akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether the environmental disaster or rather the subversive activities should be attributed to the public or the mode of production LAX is irrelevant.
"If oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the basics of life of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But, meanwhile, relations of Ogoni especially to Shell were so damaged that it was no longer issue of withdrawal from the group." Perhaps that operators with other nationalities, as the Chinese, will be better."
Then, Michael became nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" announced the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can occur at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they would not subject to an arrest, but at most they provide bribes.

Investigators discovered some manufacturing defects in the a380 reactors
The Security a380 is clearly a big problem.
In reviewing a device that has made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible defects which can lead to "a catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
Early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company had obviously quantas had so far More Than Luck: during the investigation it conducted, the Australian authority responsible for air security found that the reactors of some aircraft a380 had a serious security problem, and it warned against a possible defects.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the conduct of oil, noted in a statement issued on Thursday by the administration of the atsb.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors."
Are concerned the reactors manufactured rolls-royce and equipping 20 aircraft of the a380 series.
The company's Airbus quantas, who had to made an emergency landing on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now begun proceedings against the English manufacturer of reactors.
Australian Federal Judicial she filed a complaint with the court which has its headquarters in Sydney. This gives him an opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The Director of quantas, Dr. Alan Joyce, said that his company would seek damages from the incident early November.
Coins were loose and bearing the surface was damaged during the fire engine.
According to rolls-royce is the ignition of oil which is at the root of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other tests for security will be done on the superjumbos which are also equipped nuclear issues.
The recommendations are the result of a security cooperation with rolls-royce, said the spokesman of the astb, Mr. Martin dolan.
The security problem is considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline quantas ground had halted its entire fleet of a380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily halted three of its 11 a380.
The company Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of a a380.

In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for shipping and hydrography, dsh is expected of tsunami took place on the Baltic coast of schleswig-holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Clusters of snow on motorways and on the federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the central of bad weather warning meteomedia violet announced the level of alert was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that strong winds and costs have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars remained stuck at night.
Even in the land of saxe-anhalt, the police authorities announced major disruptions on the roads.

In thuringe, snowfall has affected the A4 and A9 highway.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disruptions were held in Saxony, saxe-anhalt, thuringe and in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, fallen trees on the tracks, the caténaires needles or destroyed.
In Saxony, we had to interrupt the interregional transport leipzig-nuremberg.
At sallfeld, in thuringe, a train ice into Munich had to interrupt his trip.
Firefighters and the paramedical had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in blankets, food and beverages.
Winds of snow swept roads.
Snowfall led to many flight cancellations at major airports of Germany.
According to a spokesman of the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for fraport indicates that 40 flights have been cancelled in Frankfurt on the hand.

It is true that the passengers stranded at the airport are more numerous, despite that barely 400 beds are available to them.
The accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening at ostholstein, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of layers of snow operating on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was stopped.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth at Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a woman of 30 years died when his car was on a slippery road to aschaffenburg barrel.
However, meteorologists predict good news: snow will be always powdery, soft, but it tourbillonnera in case of minor gusts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent winds and fast.

Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: according to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The building could raise up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just to embellish the headquarters of the group: the Twin Towers located in the business district were modernized; meanwhile, the bankers had to return to their former location.

Thousands of people crying children who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people were buried a thought for the miners who were declared dead following a number of explosions at a mine.
Had not been able to recover the bodies because the security situation of the affected wells continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River mine near the town of greymouth.
29 minors whose age is between 17 and 62 years had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but it had found no evidence of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that followed, no rescue team could descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second detonation violent, the authorities and the administration had considered minors no longer had any chance of survival.
So far the bodies could not be back.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered in the bright sun greymouth south of the island of New Zealand.
They have observed two minutes of silence.

Go to hell, warrior!
The film is splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas ronde refn explores the limits of the kind former thanks to his film," walhalla rising," epic course.
Public in which the Danish director Nicolas Ronde did refn have thought by turning "walhalla rising"?
A Viking warrior, mads mikkelsen having only one eye is captured; he releases his torturer and, with an almost supernatural force, to eliminate his opponents the one after the other. This is ideal for the young male audience in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero using brutal methods of murder. When it is in a bad mood, it severs the intestines of its enemies before they died.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the eye said no word on her real name. Even the other characters leak, at most, by way of one or two sentences a few calls of agony appalling.
Otherwise, there is silent and festoie in the mountainous landscape incredibly beautiful Viking of Scotland which is the scene of the universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more mature filmmakers with an interest in the ideal existentialism and for the travellings excellent.
When a film is several target groups, it is unfortunate that they are mutually exclusive.
The Director ronde refn is considered, since "pusher," his trilogy on drug smuggler bitter and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin tarantinon mood, but he has refused to make a little more mainstream or bring a little less than brutality in the theatre art and testing.
Most of the supporters of the art would find the horror movie brain which is spreading around and the intestines.
Action film fans die of boredom, when the eye sailed, for reasons that can be freely interpret violent, with a group of Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by calm and haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
Then it is not surprising that "walhalla rising" has found no film distributor in Germany and there are only in the DVD format.
This is largely because of beautiful images of poverty that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, lies behind a grandiose appearance and bloody.
It is not a question of dialogues in this film, nor of a coherent, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream into film.
The viewer cannot escape.
Refn him is just a moment of relaxation and cup slowly freezing the throat with images and an audio tape gloomy, but especially with an elusive hatred that emerges from the heart of the characters.
Only a golden boy, who is closely with the eye, preserves a certain innocence, all other are motivated by anger.
More than anything, the hero eye whose motives are not known, but returning to hell temporarily at any time to fight enemies and allies by becoming the warrior, may be sent from the Devil himself.
It represents the decay, but maybe just for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"walhalla rising enigmatic" is a movie that can be disliked or admire, which aims at irritation, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious bulldozing
The International Atomic Energy Agency has new indications about a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But it refused to comment on this subject, much less to submit to inspections of the Agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli fighter aircraft f-15 I attacked a mysterious form cubic building on Syrian territory.
It is on the shore of the euphrate; the biggest city located near trapped air is located 30 kilometres is provides as-sur.
His name in the documents of the IAEA, because this is the reactor that Syria has built allegedly with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric power.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby el-kibar, would be capable of producing plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
In contrast, the technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images blurred.
Through the computer animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the station, which represents a miniature copy of yongbyon North Korean model of the nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, even internally.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, it has barely more information than at the time, and even with the time the mystery thickens increasingly.
Former US president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was certainly assured that Syria had built a reactor el-kibar, but had peu' signs this country developed "an active program of nuclear weapons."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more careful about that and speak only of a "presumed reactor" even if they see the presentation of the CIA as "credible."
They lack of evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
About how it ensures that it deals with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat of the United Nations had given only a terse response in summer by saying that the IAEA had "enough documents to ask questions."
The Syrians have certainly abducted hurriedly the rubble of unused "military building" methodical and proceeded with a flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by the former Chief Inspector Oli heinonen, discovered at el-kibar uranium traces produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received through a Member State of the satellite images of direct commercial providers showing the time that followed the attaque. it seems that they are more eloquent than those made by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the sponsor anonymous, perhaps Israel, has acquired in them.
It is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that she had never done a secret atomic program and that she had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found at the site from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of particles as an unlikely.
Since then, Damascus refuses any discussion in this regard, as on the satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to make a second inspection on the site of el-kibar and refused access to the ruins of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel maintains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, then at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never comments on this matter."
Thus, the investigation into this case drags on since June 2008 without reaching a result and that she "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as recognizes a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the Treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.
IAEA considers that to achieve progress, we must clarify the existence of three other facilities to be "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which he is, or what is their service facilities or they suspected to contain.
According to information published by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper, known within the IAEA respectively under the names of marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah also the name of nearby towns.
The independent Institute Institute for Science and International Security, International Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images of a complex near masyaf that would most probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly why Syria refuses three sites' access to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, is that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is an information provided by the US secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
IAEA information available, including the satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been shuttling between the three sites and the parallélépipède stone to carry substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that "at least one of the facilities could be used in the production of fuel."
There would be "no indications of sensitive activities," as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
Certainly, this type of reactor works through not enriched uranium.
However, there is to the narrow plausible assumptions about fundamental questions: where should have come the uranium and where should we separated later the plutonium needed for the production of the bomb.
It is unclear whether the rubble, which could hide signs of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land are gone, nobody has information on the place of storage of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria did discuss In 1998 the al-tibni salt mine, located only a few miles from el-kibar, on the other side of the euphrate, to see if it can support the disposal of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recently photos taken by satellites on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former inspector of the IAEA, Dr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
But satellite photos show that Syria has undertaken of excavation in the three suspected sites and displaced enormous containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not contributed to remove suspicions.
As it is said in diplomatic circles that IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to be. The plan would allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only time invested shows how great interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored that proposal.
A year ago, while the Western diplomats in Vienna had not refers to the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, glyn Davies, the Ambassador of the United States in recent months evokes what is known as the inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the atomic agency to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Dr. yukiya amano, who was to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "one option to which I am open to the future," but he still hesitating.
This method has an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority of the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as this diplomat who gives reflect: "At this point, if at the end they find nothing '
Love in TIME OF WAR
Things are going badly since Angelina Jolie made its debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the script itself: it is a love story between a man and a woman from Bosnia of Serbian origin.
There is nothing more about this story, but enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent indicates that the rumours, a Muslim woman, fell in love with his Serbian executioner during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian Women's federations have immediately protested. In response, sequences of shooting planned in Sarajevo have been displaced in last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in post production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a newspaper Bosnian, bakira hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and it demanded to meet with the actress. Jolie is itself Goodwill Ambassador of UNHCR.
It is not already diplomat. A few weeks ago, it proposed to those women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined the offer.
"The meeting is to be held in Bosnia," says hasecic.
There has been no of love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of lengthy Jolie says on its attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reported that the Organization of hasecic, subsequently, recommended the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what sort of scenario has beautiful writing?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of its scenario, gave after some hesitation authorization of shooting in Sarajevo, but we do not know why did not then come despite the authorization.
The Young Author itself ensures that it does not pursue political objectives with his film, that it is making a great deal of effort that was made aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She said that she wants to highlight the dire consequences of war and give the opportunity to all parties involved to speak.
It remains vague on the content.
As a second synopsis of the film is running on the net. It is quite different: lovers knew each other well before the start of the War. He will meet again when the woman, a Muslim Bosnian Serb, was deported in the concentration camp where the man worked as a guard.
Which still represents a big difference with the version "of a rape victim is amourache his executioner."
That the film of Jolie started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it and is beautiful, is "Unfair and based on erroneous information."
Now, only fanatics of Hollywood can provide peace: with illegally this scenario in the net, like many others before.
Draw us!
This evening, so well in the Irish again.
No sign of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans roar of joy on background of a strong music, they trépignent feet.

Cian Tanner is an individual calm; this subtle game to drink and computer reserved, both, really do not go well together.
Yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years seeks to have fun, away from the issue boring, leading to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in its projects. In January, he will job interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling, however," he says.
"home is so far and I did not employment."
Finally: his girlfriend is already in Auckland," less than two, she took his job like as responsible for project event, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because bleak prospects in the country, two of the three sisters to tan tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position of computer consultant in London.
Young people go: the situation of most families living on the island resemble that of Tanner.
The experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute indicated that 100,000 Irish will leave their country soon.
They also provide a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
Which is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million.
If these projections, it will be a stream of emigration comparable to that Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed a fluent, the grief is now the whole place.
However, the economic crisis affects especially youth Irish, well trained, who have so far only moments of joy.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, meanwhile, three in ten of less than 30 years are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper published widely readers letters written by young emigrants, who complained: "in Ireland, so to drift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but anyone who has the possibilities are going and our country and a whole generation."
"The last to leave off the light."
The Irish law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Union of Students, sees point the future worse because the government is only throw dust in the eyes and saw no future for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the young student of 20 years.
She saw how his comrades clung to an internship without pay to another.
She said that are his greatest concern is to emigrate itself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing." thought
However men as Stephen mclarnon try to positively address this issue.
Mclarnon organizes the lounge "workingabroadexpo" which offers a full support on the theme "working abroad."
"But the work abroad is for the new in the profession an extraordinary opportunity to take the first step in the ranks of the hierarchy," says the responsible.
Its Web site shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: to work abroad is not a boat, but it also guarantees the freedom and pleasure.
For six months, seán o Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland to the engineer of 29 years, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house fate precisely of land to gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects hannovre or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O Donovan rarely visit his native country, as part of an additional job in order to complete to repay the loan agreed to build its home in home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says in crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live virtually no more."
He let out an embarrassed laughter through the cold rooms.
The Small House is located in a residential area with gardens in front of treated, expensive cars of big names are stationed on the routes.
Four years ago, O Donovan has bought the house in common with his sister in the amount of 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by the credit.
"They were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Afraid to see all collapse due to the credit?
O Donovan reflects a moment, ressert of hot tea and said: "I don't have children to maintain and I am young; even goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The engineer of the building does not like the lamentations he is often these days.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what has been once lived here in the island," he says.
"For a moment to work abroad, that is not what can happen worse, perhaps that's why we feel first Irish.
He laughs and then spoke of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after having spent seven years and, in Ireland, life simply continued."
This idea appeals to cian Tanner.
Leave the future and see how life elsewhere.
In his record, he already has several years of working in London. That is why the life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is another thing that worries the well in recent days: the party to hold on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that it does not develop into evening farewell.
"Only, not many emotions," he says with a long sip of beer.
"A Farewell, it seems still worrying."
"Call it rather an evening of Goodbye, any relaxed, with some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as to private enterprise.
The crime has become a great concern that unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the last survey latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two elements from results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the mood sunny enough in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America, see Table 1.
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 percent per year since 2002, support for democracy is from a minimum of 40 percent in 2005 to 61 percent this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has rebounded after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average, see Table 2.
Some 44 percent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy in their countries worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25% in 2001, Chart 3.
Some 34 percent said they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45 percent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but sharply compared to 2003, 17 percent and 24 percent respectively.
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have shaken the support for democracy.
If it has held out for the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have suffered only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year, 32 percent."
But the mood varies widely from one country to another, see chart 4.
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its former President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulted in a widespread feeling of progress
What is more common in Mexico and Central America where the downturn was more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country, see Table 5.
About 31 percent said that they or their close were victim of a criminal act in the past year, however, the figure is down from 38 percent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase of support to the private sector and the market economy. About 71 percent of respondents in the region say that the private sector is vital to the development, 56 percent in 2007, see chart 6.
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that makes their developed country, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62 percent of respondents in Venezuela are of this view, and 80 percent said the private company; even if left their president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19 percent of respondents, compared to 18 percent last year, followed by the United States, 9 percent, unchanged from last year and Venezuela, 9 percent, down 11 percent since last year.
But the United States is considered as the most influential country by people in Mexico and in most of central America, while Venezuela has this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote blemished
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the affected countries and soaked in fear.
Ballot boxes were presented and a new voting, ballot papers scattered in the goutières, destruction of polling stations and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many hatïens, including many who have been displaced following the earthquake in January, roamed the neighborhood to find where vote.
Some of them have eventually abandon.
A dozen of the presidential candidates, including several favorites, denounced the alleged fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
However, edmond mule, the senior official in Haiti to the United Nations, said the event as "an election fairly good in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that they didn't believe "that these irregularities, no matter how serious, necessarily had invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval outgoing President unpopular, and its candidate, Jude célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
Hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel martelly, a rap musician, and mirlande manigat, a former First Lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. célestin who has little or no visible support among voters, was declared by the electoral authority as reaching the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million of the earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that the participation would be.
In this case, many haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet issued shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians do it themselves.
Tip toe towards the centre
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina fernández, President of Argentina, has seen a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, to more than 50%, which is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet turn this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. fernández, obviously in mourning or not, that it would the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs are still confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who has continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to prepare budgets that underestimated the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
It has allowed the first couple to spend the extra revenue at will.
The Government of Ms. fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation was plunged into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissident members of the ruling Movement péroniste rallied to Ms. fernández.
But after chaotic, where a parliamentary sessions struck in the face of his peers and that others have accused the government of corruption, Congress has not to approve the Budget 2011.
"I will not fight," said the president.
Currently, the budget 2010 will be implemented next year, leaving the President still more flexibility to spend at will.
The overheating economy largely: it is likely to grow by almost 9 percent this year.
The official rate of inflation is now at 11.1% but many private estimates and the wage demands of unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and served the indec, the Statistical Office, who conducted the falsification of official statistics on inflation.
Ms. can fernández now moderating these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit the wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been propelled by high world prices of agricultural exports to Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why she fernández shows signs of wanting to restore financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government has reached an agreement with bondholders refused forced a previous restructuring of the debt which Argentina had not paid its deadlines in 2001.
Ms fernández now seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this would involve a surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado boudou, the Minister of the economy, has announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which resembles a prelude of the indec sanitation.
It is not clear whether Ms. fernández wishes to keep policy beyond the end of its mandate, now that he is no longer at his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very promoted.
When the Argentinians are back from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it has returned.
If it wants to win another election, it will decide whether or not to repudiate silently, many policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
Taiwanese voters are if referred to a kind of greater unity with the mainland.
What Taiwan thinks of his older brother located across the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters are presented on November 27, 70 percent of those eligible to elect mayors and city councils in five urban districts, within the framework of what is considered an overall assessment of the President, my ying-jeou.
Mr. my has himself become a substitute for the feelings from mainland, with innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. my passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kua Min Tang, kmt has won three of the five municipalities, he failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the party démocrate-progressiste, DPP, which has tilted complete independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all votes cast for the kmt 45%.
If this was a presidential elections, Mr. my would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of votes from his party has fallen by about 8 percent.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the kmt in the municipal councils.
The event has unveiled most of the key topics of Taiwanese elections, including trucks to campaign noisy and flags of mass rally with minimal girls dancing in uniform.
Compulsory an assassination attempt mysterious has also been committed.
Sean link, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of kmt, conducted a campaign tour for a candidate of the kmt on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot at the young Mr. link, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passing.
Strangely, it has not been determined whether the gunman wanted to harm Mr. link or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said tsai ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an impact on the election in LEADER suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the kmt.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was interesting to see how the issue of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates were made with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the kmt tends to avoid displaying its relationship with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also failed to fan the feeling anti-chinois.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, claimed a confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Beijing government continues to provide trade facilities, under its strategy to lure Taiwan, back home.
China lost no time to send a negotiator in Taipei to arrange a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
But it would also like to see a political integration; But first things first.
Better wait for this after the presidential election in 2012.
The DPP has reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it was bad, his former chief, Chen shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President of 2000 to 2008, it was an explicit provocative in favour of independence.
But a new generation of moderate started under the direction of Ms. tsai and the PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. tsai was hailed as the DPP's candidate for the presidency, as Su tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Mrs tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that the talks can take place without preconditions.
Taiwan tsai recounts the public that his party presents an alternative "trustworthy" rushed from the approach of Mr. my about China.
Mr. Chen appears exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidates from the PDP would have done better if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to seek the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have difficulty choose between its potential candidates.
We need the kmt to introspection of yourself.
Assessments of Mr. my were low, despite a sharp economic growth, the candidates of kmt did not wish to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for kmt said that his cabinet as well as its local branches will be revised.
The achievements of PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio general, a prominent newspaper columnist," the point of no return has already passed."
Appointments to Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Carried out at the request of a president, and people are required to review.
Esperanza 26 years of spalding, the jazz bassist and singer picked by hand by President Obama to occur during his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a major appointment in the category of "Best New Artist."

Elsewhere, voters Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "historicity" Vijay iyer trio in the category "instrumental album," somewhere on a shivering invigorating a recording that was one of the favourites paramount last year.

Trombone shorty, favourite to New Orleans hoarse voice and a frequent Guest "treme" hbo, was recognized in the contemporary jazz category, which gave also strongly to certain merger with the Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff lorber albums.
Secret society of wild Darcy James argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well deserved recognition in the bigger picture category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz Billy childs together and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "pathways" of his octet' s Live was an example of the hand's democratic bassist as head of group.

The project of the mosque in temecula won the approval of the Planning Commission.
A draft mosque in temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning Commission after more than five hours of testimony public, often heated.
Critics have attacked the project, arguing that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new centre religious met the local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support: Christians, Jews, bahaïs, you mention," said Hadi nael, President of the Islamic Centre temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud of, as American citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just vote very strong."
"We have the right people in the valley."
The meeting began at 6 a.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people casting for or against the centre, the time almost equally distributed, according to the press-enterprise.

She worked a site of 4.32 hectares on the road Nicolas about two miles east of chaparral high school.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange, who can use bacterium arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on earth and perhaps beyond.
While the researchers found the bacteria unusual here on earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the key elements that were considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can be developed with phosphorus, either with arsenic."
"This is why it is very special, even if it is far from being a truly foreign" life," said Paul Davies C. W. of the State University of Arizona, author of the report contained in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life:, hydrogen carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, found in the lake mono, in California, is able to continue to develop After replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. State University of Arizona, author of the report.
The discovery is important in Life Beyond Earth research because they must be able to recognize the life, to know what life is, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss, who did not disclose the details of the discovery, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The planetary discovery "shows that in other settings, agencies may be able to use other elements to operate the biochemistry and that all" standard," which we consider necessary elements for life, might not be set, "said Charles cockell, Professor at the Institute of scientific research and spatial, global Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of a basic element to another in biochemistry and biochemical the structure," said cockell.
It was not a serendipitous discovery.
Felisa wolfe-simon of the Institute of astrologie NASA, who led the study, chose the lake mono because it is supplied with high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; it had speculated that a microbe exposed the two substances may be able to substitute to one another.
"chemical toxic arsenic is mainly because its behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"Accordingly, the agencies have difficult to distinguish those elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough so that it does not exactly as phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in some ways, the work of our gum biochemical machine," said Anbar.
Researchers gathered the bacterium known under the name of gfaj-1 and was exposed to increasing levels of arsenic that she has been able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally or else on earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has never shown that this could walk.
Arsenic was more prevalent at the beginning of the existence of the land, she said, so the researchers speculated that the first LIFE could use.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form the life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the research team wolfe-simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs to exhibition on four stolen from outside a motel in bellflower were recovered, Los Angeles County sheriffs have announced Thursday.

Peek and rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National championat "akc/eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they intended to present evidence.
The other dogs were expected to participate in other competitions tests in the days before the "akc/eukanuba exhibition," said peek at times Wednesday.
The SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS one of the decisions of the couple's dog exhibition tour of almost a month.
On Monday evening, peek and rickard verified in the motel.
They are often in motels and park their pickup outside, adjacent to the window of their house.
They took three other dogs - a puppy boxer, an parson Russell Terrier and a épagneul Breton - who stayed with them in the motel's house.
But they left the akitas and the corgis thicker, fur, in the van where it would be more cost.
They have a little open windows, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and rickard reported the theft of the truck at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who might lead to corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is awaiting the final green light to the Court

It is being distributed licensed by the investment bank, which has itself to $75 million, and should be funded by the middle of December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank moelis & Co. has been hired to advise the direction on how to get its finances as it could not afford to pay the interest amounting to $300 million per year.

When officially MGM fate of bankruptcy in the following weeks, the companies moelis and Cooper receive payments of millions of dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co, which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper, who raised $375,000 companies per month for their services of management, will receive a "success" bonus of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum to revitalize the production of MGM, which took out only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films would emerge from 2012.
They also intend to jointly finance two films based on "The hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate between $265 million and $275 million loan to finance its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl icahn, which holds about 18 percent of the debt of MGM, has tried to achieve a merger of studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where it is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.

Bring Milder side in law enforcement in China
Tang shenbin urban arpentait a place of the city as a sergeant in the training in inspecting severely expenses nerve, using for low voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - Responsible imposing of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - pass a certain sense to a set of spectators.
"Stay right!"
"Be perçantes!"
SHOW, he says," What look like the beautiful girls! "
Four girls having just past Adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and trousers of olive, figeaient stand on.
Black four pairs of shoes to heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly perched at the top of hair tied with a broken knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are cute."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of urban inspectors of China.
A city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree.
Guangdong province has exchanged the addition of against a blue uniforms supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, central China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux by the hard way: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers had surrounded a snack uncontrollable cart with black eyes firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packed up his affairs and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation of image.
Since 2003, the District has completed its Street Police in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their curve and their young woman.
The idea is to give the police roughly trimmed a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even scarlett Johansson could have difficulty in attracting the eyes on this brigade urban underground in China
And for cause, critics say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only permitted to enforce the municipal ordinances in imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors in the province of hubei beat to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to the film in trying to disperse a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing, stolen and put online, describes how effectively defeat offenders without any blood.
This year in Shanghai, a peddler watermelons was eliminated with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, shows inspectors of China trained in the onslaught of street vendors.
"chengguan marked the government," said last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "real thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After that the district has spent an announcement in October to find eight new recruits, an editorial, appeared in the Beijing Evening News, questioned whether the women had real tasks or if they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The announcement of the District for female candidates, ages 18 to 22 years, to have a nice silhouette and "The Five facial features in the right order."
They must have a larger than the average, $1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement to 26 years is compulsory.
Officers said that the work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years.
"It is their image that is important," said some of the district officer rednet.com, a Web site quasi-gouvernementale.
"Firstly, the external qualifications of candidates will determine if they agree; it is the size, weight, facial features, ETC"
Then temperament and the "internal Qualifications."
Women of the chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng lihua, Deputy Director of the Office of Management district of the city, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were standard Chinese in many job opportunities for both sexes.
Such is the case of the exigeance on the order of facial features.
That mean beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Admittedly, the disabled or disfigured need not apply.
"We cannot leave a person who box or a bossu serving here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He would not give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the place baoguang near a monastery, aged 22 and has clouded cheeks with a mouth finely curved.
It did not consider the development of its appearance as sexist," she said.
"Do you think I seem sexy in this uniform?" she asked an air disillusioned.
Xu Yang, his colleague to pits aged 21, said: "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They do not object to that their mandate is limited, they said, because they have more career ambitions than simply hunt vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen vendors who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell the most of rolls or tofu bowls before taking off.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We have said several times!," said Ms Xu while a seller had fled on foot, leaving her vélo-charrette temporarily in noodles.
Officials describe their functions rather lonely that difficult.
"This is about the same every day," said Huang jing, aged 20, who studied the marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that the female officers do not have the power to their male counterparts to confiscate the assets of vendors.
They can only threaten to male offenders to their superiors.
It tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spreading false rumours that chengguan officers had killed a seller.
Overnight, more than a dozen police and chengguan officers were injured, 14 vehicles of the government were overturned or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks of the placid baoguang place, where the female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk, rather than in a store, as the regulation imposes.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted to the scandal.
A trial of strength of 15 minutes followed before the police, face disaster, have made their way with elbow into their vehicle and have gone up to speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, its white badge returned to hide its name.
As the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 or more - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a cirée image.
"Sometimes, we fight orally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," said Dr. Li said a neutral manner.
"Most of the time, the public ahead."
Prosecutors charge citizens if they not Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice have lifted the criminal charges laid on Senator John Ensign, arising from a matter related to an assistant of an ancient campaign and its efforts to obtain a lobbying for the husband of the woman, have announced Wednesday the senator's lawyers.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was seen as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012 until the scandal of his case is the national headlines last year and harm his career.
The Office of Dr. Ensign said he was "very pleased" with the decision, the result of an investigation of one year.
Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate ethics committee.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed that the Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any accusation against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has failed to comment on this.
The announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, that there was any evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign allegedly conspired to violate federal criminal a ban on lobbying.
Interviews, mailings and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicating that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in case of Senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton has once served as Treasurer in a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and, then, he defended their rights after they have hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying for them; according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator with Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate in its entirety.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appeared to contradict the ban known as the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public," there seems to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and material breach of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the judge of the department refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in case Ensign, Mr. brand and other ethics lawyers have said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks cashed high level by the Public Integrity Section, including the decision last year to drop the charges against the former senator Ted Stevens charged with misconduct for prosecution.
Federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take up arms," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul coggins, lead counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday of the Ministry of Justice and monitoring the following day, saying that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
The team of lawyers from Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a press release," had acted according to the law."
Mr. coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that he made to the public prosecution.
"I am not comfortable to go into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to abandon an independent inquiry into a complaint by the Group of ethics, arguing that the payment of $96.000 by parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that it was not enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major company of Nevada that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton lobbying to find work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company received Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "by" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, allegiant air, and he asked the Secretary of Transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When the news of the case have surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his post as leader to fourth Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee will soon follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and would end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," she says.
Cheshire will expose to Twitter's appeal
Half a dozen of them are currently type in the distance in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute of the reports of harrowing testimony via Twitter.
At the end, the defence said that there were over 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children committed to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three family members Cheshire, in Connecticut, should lead to a formal end when the judge would impose the death penalty, passed by the Board.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes were already file of evidence in court describing appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years.
The provocative thing is that the intensive reporting on the trial - and the widespread use and extended by the journalists "the twitter - have created an atmosphere of Circus," so widespread saturation and instant with incendiary details that the board had been improperly influenced by public passions.
The application could push the appeals judges to discuss the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experience at this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms infringes human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of State, human rejected the claims in the ruling last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the board was allegedly led by passion.
But that does not appear to be the last word on the issue.
Appellate courts recognize for decades that the media coverage of the notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment of 1966 landmark, the United States Supreme Court quashed the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was "a carnival atmosphere at trial" through the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show "The Fugitive" and the film.
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts seized to review half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious, given the argument that new rules would be required to manage the means of communication inconceivable courtrooms, at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media in the trial of large scale," said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor donohue says that some appeals judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from the courtroom could allow more fair trial.
The case of Twitter is only one among many described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years, which delayed the execution.
Defence lawyers also said, for example, that Mr Hayes had suffered damage when the judge blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing their gruesome photos of criminal scenes during jury selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photos of victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and her daughters, hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years.
Defence lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge had unfairly deported one juror, who had been critical before prosecutors, and that it had improperly put pressure for a verdict in taking the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
Jurors have not been impounded.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the largest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by the candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media continued to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The scuffle daily media tweets, cameras and journalists to the Palace of Justice," wrote the lawyers, "resembled nothing of what was seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the cover of the twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the new instant were more incendiary that handed releases more slowly, was a view luddiste who would impoverish the policy of governing media coverage of future court proceedings.
But some lawyers said that the appellate courts were often attracted by the arguments that the social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their files, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 which overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of the media coverage of the trial and they indicated that they allege the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," écrivaient-ils, "is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility can reconcile lines?
After a campaign marked by abuse and the negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a bipartisan real cooperation forward or a moment illusory before the swift return to the partisan fight in the capital?
Obama's meeting Tuesday between the president and the leaders of Congress has produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be discussed during the session of the "lame duck."
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion on differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibility to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score flush empty rating point supporter.
Wednesday's public meeting of the President's Commission on the deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation arrived.
Both sides are now in a trial period and probation for signs of mutual cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of the public opinion and the patience of voters for a partisan war renewed.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of participants unveiled a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapidly changing climate that has existed in the past two years.
Whether tax, health care spending, or the rights, the two sides remain of miles away.
However, the November election had tempered Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone," said Pete wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now the side of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are partisan passions and then they are estomptent.
That is good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, the Republicans and the Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
The two sides to find a way to preserve some or all of permanent or temporary.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while rejecting the unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting Tuesday at the White House, more optimism looms over a possible agreement on issues raised during the session regarding the "lame duck" with the ratification of the Covenant "new start."
But William galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the session "blade duck" does not necessarily ménera to better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is unlikely, if not inevitable.
"Once things that must be made will be, psychology in the short term will one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner widespread also expressed skepticism that civility lead to a genuine cooperation.
"I believe most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electorate tea that contributed to its creation.
However the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they should try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new law on health care.
These clear partisan positions are already in The first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission of deficit which included reform of the tax code and to raise taxes, raising the retirement age and reduce spending.
The will Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks deal in Washington and have, by themselves, imposed the public deficit issue on the agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need of 14 votes to the commission, composed of 18 members, to express their plan as a formal recommendation, and they had difficulty to reach this number.
The most resistance remains among the group's elected, suggesting that there is on tax matters, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston includes two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will next year in the form of partisan clashes, as the Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; then to be followed by a period of greater bilateral cooperation.
What is the cause of change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If the Confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, when the two parties will watch closely the public's reaction.
Who will be judged in loss should change course and find compromises.
But it would nevertheless be optimistic a point of view.
The partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid 1990s and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress that there were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 merely as a prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on issues that divide them again.
The US documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the town is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and put up at Kremlin part of protection bribery and money it collects, said the US embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service achieved enormous scams that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only legitimate businesses but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its share While the money moves to the top of the scale.
The memo, which was distributed in Washington under the name of Ambassador John beyrle, was mailed Wednesday by wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names have been eliminated.
It was written while Yuri loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there has since been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena batourina leading, who owns a construction company, has always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation on these accusations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian TV channel, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt," That is crazy, it is to throw, anything."
The Russians, by an overwhelming majority, believe that their company is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report of embassy; and it is incredible to see how it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The contacts established between the Government of the Moscow city and crime has led some people in the name of "dysfunctional" and to say that the government operates more like a kleptocracy that a government," according to the note of the embassy.
"The criminal elements enjoyed a" krysha," a term used in the criminal world/The mafia which literally means "roof" or protection which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service, FSB, the Ministry of the Interior, mvd and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts to identify a structure at three levels in the criminal world in Moscow."
"luzhkov is the summit."
"The FSB, the mvd and the militias are the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fills a gap in some areas where the city does not provide services."
The report indicates that the FSB involves the money of the largest companies and that the police target small.
A source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to secure the protection of mvd and FSB, instead of the organized crime groups, because not only, they have more weapons, more money and more power than the criminal groups but they are protected by the law."
"That is why the application for protection by criminal gangs is not as high."
The note said that, although the collection of money should be extended, the care itself can be uneven, even those who pay are subjected to an arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their close affairs under any pretext or another.
Medvedev has referred several times the fight against corruption but admitted the little progress.
The Embassy reports delivered the note referring to men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, until the Kremlin.
"in its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview gueorgui satarov, Director of the Indem think tank "in Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because he could not exist in Russia."
Without the policy, opposition, separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the cost of corruption is stated, across the entire Russia, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country has been ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International, the countries are ranked at least at more corrupt.
The disclosure of the memorandum to the US embassy, which was was conducted yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although loujkov can be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this might be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is trying to solve the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN Larry King, Putin suggested that the documents of wikileaks could be manufactured and reacted with anger at what the US diplomats had disclosed in the appellant batman Robin and bringing together Medvedev.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor of domestic policy in that country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that it would be done with this arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to the ethics."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly lit with concrete walls shoddy of poor quality, the director of the anlong secondary school veng mentioned the man who had built, the last chief of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here love Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and his concern for his people," said sreng kor Ma, aged 42.
Known as "The Butcher" for his brutality, while he was the head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the loyalty of longstanding was finally called into question in anlong veng.
In April, a local forum of Truth and Reconciliation allowed victims to respond publicly to people who participated in the plan.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school, which, for the first time, teaches history of Khmer Rouge for children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, made its first award in a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture centre of tuol sleng, Kaing khek iev, better known as "Duch."
Before these developments, anxiety increased with veterans of the Khmer Rouge anlong veng; complicating efforts for reconciliation and their wishes of Cambodian reintegrate into society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said chhang youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within the families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese have invaded and toppled the government of Pol pot-unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they have launched an insurgency which lasted until the last movements travel in December 1998.
While Pol Pot Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrillas from their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to anlong veng.
But in the mid 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters have begun to defect to the government, culminating with the capitulation of Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary in 1996 and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 and Ta Mok of natural causes, which had held head, was captured by the government forces in 1999 in the mountains near dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their supporters, most of the veterans Khmer Rouge have sunk in abject poverty, common in Cambodia's rural areas; and many people remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some elite officers Khmer Rouge have kept their posts of local leader in exchange for farmers have laid down their arms, he is not qualified to low rank and file.
"These people have benefited little monitoring after the fall," said Sok leang Centre for Justice and reconciliation that holds public forums across Cambodia, including anlong veng.
"They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of regime."
"They were raised in a setting where do business is a foreign concept."
Be Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around anlong veng before moving in 1998 as a poor farmer of rice.
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we must maintain our own needs."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused some concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the Court should begin the judgement of Nuon Chea Khieu Samphan Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The Tribunal's mandate is to try senior leaders and most responsible for the crimes, but he did not say if he continue beyond the four cases.
We need more to calm fears anlong veng.
Recent media speculation turned to IM chaem, 64 years of age, former chief of district in the province of banteay meanchey during the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the dam trapeang thma, a project where thousands of forced labourers were killed.
Recently, during an evening scorching IM chaem returned from work in field near his house in wood pile, on a dirt road outside anlong veng.
Desiccated as the sun cast long shadows on the grass, im chaem refused to discuss his past in Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, she said, she refused to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," "she said.
"If there are more than prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had defected Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the Tribunal suing several suspects; while the experts and historians deny this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But face the past is all that Cambodia should do to move forward, said youk chhang, the documentation centre.
"reconciliation in terms Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces, he said.
"We must put those pieces together so that we can understand."
The Centre has produced the first approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge Manual," a history of Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
It has distributed to anlong veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for colleges, which contained less than four pages of the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, youth anlong veng know details of the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch valeak, 19 years old, a student at the High School of anlong veng, said that the new manual Helping students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejected many parts of the manual and the Tribunal," he says.
"They wary because they don't know exactly how many people the Tribunal will continue."
Such resistance made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult," said Sok leang.
But public forums, the manual and the Court is beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the mountains of dangrek Heights, a road, overgrown with weeds and full of plastic bags, drove to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a tin roof rusted.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, aged 31, sales of mobile phone roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at this location.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray, she says.
It was the anniversary of nuom sothea, and later that day, she planned to walk to the final resting place of Pol Pot, where she would leave a ripe bouquet of bananas in the hope to bring luck.
Belarus agrees to waive its uranium stockpile of quality military
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons; that decision is part of a surprise victory to President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was included in a joint statement issued after the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rodham met here the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov, in addition to a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince it to abandon the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached the horizon last spring.
But US officials had told the Washington Post that some classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons grade uranium from a research centre of Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to remove the rest of the material for about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the 47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit, held at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was good to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat in nuclear safety summit in 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that this process works," said Ken luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "significant of very significant step," conducted by Belarus.
Obama is committed in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
It would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on Nuclear Security of Obama, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We kept of hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium, which is essentially military quality of uranium and low enriched uranium," said then Lukashenko.
"This is our product... we will not dirty bombs, and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We'll use it for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus came closer to the United States some months ago; however, also show interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium for Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, said officials.
He was placed on a special train that has traveled more than 1,300 miles up to a facility in Russia that can be eliminated, said the officials.
The second operation was completed Monday and was conducted by air, according to officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low enriched uranium; unsuitable for the weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization have been implemented in order to build confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy specializing in the Global Threat Reduction.
According to the estimates of the Centre for Study of nonproliferation James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of uranium military quality, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States are strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and vital to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has no objections to the CIA flights
The Government has no objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo leadership through Spanish territory, in a telegram from the Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This is shown by the documents filtered, cables, by wikileaks daily in the country, adding that the government's first vice president at that time, María Teresa fernández be informed of the Vega, asked the Executive Spanish for "pouvoir' demonstrate they exercise adequate surveillance on Foreign Planes across Spain."
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe which accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between the former American ambassador Eduardo aguirre and fernández de la Vega.
She acknowledged that the report of the Council "had surprised the Zapatero government of part of the game" and stressed the fact that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega said that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They want only to be informed" to avoid that they "take by surprise," said aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the Ministry of External at that time, Miguel ángel Moratinos, was reported to the ambassador that the Executive Spanish "Wanted for this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the government has limited ability to influence."
In turn, in January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was sent to the Embassy on the fact that he would not block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Center, CNI, and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any element, criminalizing any sensitive information," said the embassy after talking with the prosecutor.
The United States still showed their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" More than the information declassified CNI o the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate efforts to operate the case quietly between governments," aguirre regret.

The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the action the PP in this case.
"In spite of its overall direction, our experience suggests the fact that pp certainly conflict will benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be construed as possible violations of human rights, even if those révélations-là have negative consequences for the United States," she noted.

Members of the People's Party would win four seats in the Congress and the CHP loses 9
With the results of the 18-n, the PP could be decisive in the municipes lérida, tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant growth of votes and members in the last elections autonomic, the Catalan pp has already covered the general because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more than positive, because the number of votes that this training gains in these comices double that Normally it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the Catalan popular received 610.473 votes to the 2008 general, while autonomic of 2006, they had received 316.222.
On Sunday past, the CPP won 384.091 votes.
If one keeps the upward trend, desired misuse of votes the CHP and retention of the electorate the PP, analysts this training calculated that if there was any general election, The EIP could from 8 to 12 members in the Congress, while CIU would also four, it now has 10 and CHP loses neither more nor less than 9, he has 25 members.
Catalan these calculations perceived that the place is fundamental for PP and psoe.
According to the analysis of popular ERC lost a Member - it now has three icv - while would retain a member or would win one.
But if the election agenda continues, the more next meeting would be held in May in 2011 for the municipal comices, where the Popular Socialist may also be decisive for the end of hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the agencies that handle the higher - 661 million for 2011- budget.

Taking into account the Republican breakup, it would not fanciful that this training loses its representation in the city of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, lérida and tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to CCS, including the mayor, àngel Ros, maintained a very good relationship with Mariano rajoy - during the last campaign, they faced several times.
The popular also recorded progress on other important municipes as badalona, castelldefels or reus.

The geriatric asserts that the dead were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of olot does not eliminate the possibility of their night nurse has killed more than 11 elderly
Officials of the geriatric the caritat olot, Girona, have offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila dilmé nurse who killed at least 11 older people it was responsible in the meantime he worked there.
The Director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the Centre's lawyer, Joan cañada and announced that "the desire of the caritat would be to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and oblige us Responsibility The procedural situation civic leaders."
Social and apart from the discredit that entity can suffer for not having the criminal activity detected at time of the night, the major threat to the nurse caritat now takes the form of a major victims' compensation and the legal representatives already calculated.
Joan Vila dilmé admitted that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from that day he has not stopped to kill.
The court said in the ruling that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of Geriatric - care he suspected in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and conditions of patients, the formality was held by telephone.
The caritat, through his manager, categorically denied yesterday this situation and said that "the lack of measures in no time may have been the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of the caritat added that "in this case it was only an index of carelessness on the part of any other person that is the accused."
The person already named as the "Angel of Death" admitted Monday 11 murders and highlighted that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case it caused the death in him injecting a sobre-dose insulin to difference the first crime he committed with a mix of sedatives pellets.
The Director of the caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control centre staff access to medicines.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes nurse, in its desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that He sought for his first victims a humane death or by it the burned inside giving the laundry as has already confessed that he has done with the three women killed in the meantime 12 - October 17.
The caritat does not believe the statements of nurse at night, either the declared number of murders, they did not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude on the different versions that Vila gave in visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they remain available to the court to clarify the scope of facts.
ECB threat
Investors have reacted sharply yesterday in yesterday's threat of Trichet cautioned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
Peripherals differentials have closed to the force and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5 percent.
However, we must not underestimate the capacity of ECB to fail and the euro has barely registered a increment, which is a signal concerned.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid that market in the same way as he collapsed, he recovers, but motivated by close of short positions and very speculative.
The institutional investor takes to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB gave us today to withdraw measures of liquidity and it must withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank required finalizing the plan to purchase of public debt because of ineffective and the eventual elimination of all measures of liquidity and leaving only access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope for an extension of the current liquidity measures "at least until March quarterly" and maintain the auction to access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that it will continue with the procurement obligations and that they gave the signal of the increase.
If they do not, they can turn the hopes generated the excellent reaction markets yesterday and they continue blinded to remove the measures of liquidity, God help us.
As well as during their meeting in May in which they said that they did not even consider the purchase of bonds and they have collapsé markets, history is might repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and he said Wednesday that it had bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the auction of drafts of a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million at 5.28 per cent to 750 million at 4.81 percent of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, and reflecting a clear change of market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland was released the figures of the hole Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not identifying the problem in July with the stress, the figures are assumables test in the plan of assistance and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the government will require parliamentary approval of his new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has tempered the tone of his speech to relieve the tension before the next summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that all we interpret the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President was given the opportunity to submit yesterday the plan of action by the Council of Ministers agree on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate the employment ring to vivaldi Gill of investors as the four seasons.
The dual effect Trichet and zp explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange underwent the 4.5 percent, double as the rest of European exchanges.
To difference in February, the government and the Bank of Spain's response was swift and radical and we have the element of surprise.
Today there is a enchère-clé an obligation to three years will be benefitted from by the effect Trichet, so we hope that it would solve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinancing.
To Spain seek assistance plan would be a auto-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the triple compared to March, very dear types and they cut access to markets indefinitely.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife," Apart from being, appear."
Courage, we can get out!

Red Bull F1 triumph in with a secret weapon of Siemens
A creates improvements on the cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull ES entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and by the success.
In a prime time, no one has taken into account the options of a new stable who just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they have all backed the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without reducing the ability as pilot, the German champion Sebastien vette, either Renault engine capacity behind his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk of the legend of the "secret weapon 'that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful software simulation process launched by the German company on the market in 2007 with targets very far from the high automobilistique competition.
Appointed plm, this powerful tool technology has been used to create chains of mounting manufacturing plants around the world, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The goal is to do, faithfully simulate the product or the process before it is built in a real way, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable.
Plm facilitated the development of sukhoi, aircraft gun cameras or the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this technology in its plant in Formula 1 led Red Bull instrument to create and perform "in few hours, almost in real time," the amendments, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables in the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to bring a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team work today 180 young professionals from high qualifications, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and project any kind of changes on the cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that the plm software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing cars except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Amending the materials, the fuel, aerodynamics and the security elements.
Changes may pass from the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As only limitation this madness technology development, there is the $40 million Formula 1 that each team can spend as each season limit to facilitate competition.
Red Bull had opened the plant of high technology to develop and produce its cars in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for the journalists, are restricted.
All what is happening there is considered "Top Secret."
Staff attached to this duty are 580 people, two pilots, the champion vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 Red Bull, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian vetell.
Between the huge technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden actors, whose activity is invaluable and zero visibility.
The Director of the factory, Steve nevey technology, says that five years ago you could argue that the progress of R + D in the case of racing cars carried the 50% of victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology is the 85% of success, while pilots will 15% of the value added.
Nevey says the vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are gladiators unpredictable."

Sabadell bets on fly a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola, think 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and liability predicted the end of the war.
Despite this, it provides a collapse of the margins of interests, we will attempt to partially offset with increments of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell look capture in three years a million retail customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the future three years and survive and in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will undertake in 2011, a new plan, which will hold a will liability of three years.
The goal, just to survive without need for frob subsidies, is to win a rating of market by the uptake of one million new customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the banque- deduced, its great task since so far this bank had marred the more pmes and companies that the customer.
This year he captured 250,000 customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market document to individuals is 3.5%, while companies it exceeds the 10%.
Another base of 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with the cost reduction goal, including provocations are explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few dare banks now for goals and make them public, because the financial crisis has disrupted all levels of global banking sector.
Sabadell optimal, In fact, finalize its master plan this year, establishes it initially is four years, even if the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one year more.
Customers who leak crates of savings will be its main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by apie, guardiola stressed that transcendental 2011 will be a difficult year "and."
The Executive, in fact, believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is crucial to the survival of the banking case, has insisté-t-il.
And even if it believes that the War of smoke - which penalizes the margins - is decreasing, the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity already move at the cost of credit to offset the decline in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and be a pressure factor on the credit."
"We did not set the tap, but differentials are higher," acknowledged guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit credit in the long term and to increase the price differences - see cincodías of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase the committees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The blueprint for sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the corporate group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "solicit larger dimensions."
"Any move next year," has assuré-t-il.
He says that the needs of Spanish capital "increase enormously" and some financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentioned that the frob can replace the market in the uptake of funds in the case of new recapitalization.
After assured that sabadell can survive in the closing time of markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some predict already as a new banking liquidity crisis.
He said that we cannot issue, but on the contrary of what happened in June, the short term financing can be obtained through rest, easing the crisis.
ECSC rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the funds
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta yesterday, dismissed the possibility of a new wave of mergers of cases of savings and reiterated the speed with which has the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings coffers began, there have been several entities that have assured that they would not participate in the first period and they reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of cases of savings, ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta, denied yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers has been achieved, we cannot say that the incorporation of cajasol in the group of Banca cívica a second phase, this are adjustments."
"Most was conducted entirely; it is possible that instead of 17 13 or 14, but all major expeditions process has been made already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who worked also many in this operation," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of executive and leaders of aragón, ADEA, olavarrieta explained that the concentration is "the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it realized within the time that was set in the past, not now," in the business plans with the Bank of Spain, has emphatisé-t-il.
"the passage of 45 bodies with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62 percent to be much larger to comply with Basel," has souligné-t-il.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of views rather happy on the slow process" which showed "a lack of sérosité and meaning," because "What the Bank of Spain is reminder that we must respect the time before the end of the year."

He reiterated that the Spanish banking sector is very well tests of stress that ECB conducted in July.
Zapatero and the German Red line
Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have caused a doble government response.
On one side, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which range from tax cuts for the pmes, regulation of private employment or removal of 426 Euros to assist the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of aena, management of airports barajas and El prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other, the vice president Elena SALGADO, with the support of the former president Felipe Gonzalez, joins criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding its responsibility to remove the current crisis.
How do you interpret these movements?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a political error in his communicative.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And that Germany has a radically new vision of what is his future, which clash with one of its traditions of most of its partners.
European response to resistance, in Germany one begins to speculate on the possible three out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would the currency area.
The second, the recovery of Mark now, even if it seems of science fiction, with a stream of very favourable opinion, almost a 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a new approach to the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the break, countries of possible suspensions of payments of one of them and expansion in private sector of potential costs adjustments.
The German position is clear and it is long as it is now, therefore there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of discrepancy between what Germany believed that they should do, fiscal austerity plans and stability of public finances, and what its European partners, ci-inclut France, were.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel has hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel expresses a clear position, demanding the reform of treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and force at the same time to private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-européenne Irish because it precipitated the crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although slightly diluted, has been approved, and the following month, we should attend the reform process of the Union that pays for these measures to 2013.
Germany drew a red line that she did not think paths.
And we told everyone that, even if we must take action now with which we may not be too agree, as of this date that the former functioning of the euro would have finished.
2013 will herald the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to said of insolvency and, in this case, the private sector also bear a party of costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strict way of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as Spanish chaired the growth in the years of boom will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not only to maintain the public deficit to 3 percent in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what it does not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil leave arrive to us more tranquility.
And as we know seize the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard of this form and his double declaration, the promised reforms after the meeting of the past Saturday with large businesses and yesterday's announcement of the new measures suggests that, despite criticism by Merkel, it has opened the way for the thesis that we have to put the order at home.
But the Red line that Germany has set is, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we consider, we cannot exclude that abandoning a monetary zone too packed with countries not seriously.
And in this case, we can always say that she had warned Germany.
Sport and fraud law
Tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show the ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion ourdie in principle by two players of Real Madrid, xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has been much ink on the anti-sportif nature of this behaviour and if the two players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before completing the game, that their team already earned Clearly, the two players have deliberately lost time when they committed mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them a second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players will achieve the statutory sanction during the match next dam of the match against auxerre and can pass without boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA crowned with two matches the team coach, José mourinho and different economic are the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances like this or is not a new, or rather common practice in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, non-écrites rules, but then, from the sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case reflected a protagonist is due to the fact that this has been a team of the entity of Real Madrid, which in its anthem nobility and honour and poster that in previous occasions was sentenced to a fine of his players for the acts and the dramatization, apparently, orchestrated by mourinho, which adds an episode in addition to its expanding technician histrionic story and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this kind of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the resolution contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. with these actions are committing a fraud law because they are respectful actions with the rules of fair play, but seemed to evade its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of harm they cause to the spirit of sport.
One of the assets which includes the Fair Play is the physical integrity of opposing players, something that with these actions was not endangered, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of the goods which referred to correct the game is preventing the team of players offenders enjoys unfairly of the opposite team, which is not the case.
However, the fact paradoxical action players from Real Madrid is that it can be interpreted to what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud act, because its violation of rules has not been met in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has tried to be as clear as possible precisely to receive the criminalization of the referee.
They wanted and they have readily accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders gain mistakes meaning considered.
Here it is necessary to see that it does not at a disadvantage in rival and there is an advantage in the same match either, because the result of the action is leaving their own team with less than players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players would begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their future participation in a match.
But it is an advantage in the long term, with some degree of vagueness, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action players perform a game of punishment and spent the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of paperboard proceeds with a less than in the first round.
And so, promoted, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions do not run counter to the spirit of sport, which still party policy decision making that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules.
In our case, the players did not push to avoid the implementation of the sanctions, it would be a clear case of fraud law, M or rather they have chosen the moment in which they have submitted to it.
They took a strategic decision without defeat the penalty or flee it.
Even if the border between engineering and fraud of the law is diffuse, in this occasion, I think it was a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, I think, is due to two factors: as there were two auto-expulsions and because of the way to transmit the Director for the cause.
The disease caused the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethics as aesthetic.

Pakistan's nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad producing atomic weapons to "a faster rate than any other country."
The leaching of wikileaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered through the wikileaks confirms the huge gate preoccupation in Washington the Pakistani nuclear programme.
Lighting to share the details and tasty that offer on the content of accredited conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of security, instead of increasing," Atomic decreases "unstable and that the Asian country producing nuclear weapons" at a faster rate than any other country in the world. "
The feature of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make difficult Their Destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
That is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities in the territory under attack Taliban, the spread of nuclear materials including the rumour and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and in missile programs is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has the hire with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in the nuclear and missile programmes," the expert said Russian Yuri Korolev, the Ministry of External during a meeting with U.S. counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian assange is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the Pakistani high degree of nuclear production de Armas.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which describes as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, stated the following: "The transparency is often absent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter lavoy, the national intelligence officer for South Asia, said that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by army chief, General ashfaq kayani, he made it "very clear" to the head that "The army of Pakistan should end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
In hunt for Head of wikileaks
Obama nombrera for a senior official in the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltration.
Interpol issued a red alert for tracking the movements and locate assange.
All aspects related to wikileaks and its founder, Julian assange, form a labyrinth where it is difficult to get a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol had issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but it dates of 20 November.
And he did nothing to even with the last diplomatic filtering of more than a quarter million documents of the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the creator of wikileaks lawyer, Mark Stephens, maintains that "the police know where and how contact Mr assange."
The 20 the international police with its headquarters in Lyon, France has dictated the order to request for Sweden, but he has not made public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of this country.
Thus, the Interpol 188 countries have received an indication to identify or locate assange "for its provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest anyone affected by a red alert, many among the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a way for the National Police arrest - that the body should achieve -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that assange is.
The movement has outraged lawyers to assange yesterday, which have published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of wikileaks, 39, was ready to respond by video conference questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also indicate that assange sought and received the Prosecutor's permit out of Sweden in his case and compared to famous lavrentiy pavlovich beria, head of security for stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounced the missive.
While the world the sought - and Australia his mother defended the innocence of his son - assange continues to be in an unknown place, but it is not silent.
On Monday he granted at an unknown location a director of the Time Magazine through skype interview, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that it was responsible for having orders to American graduates that they épient to the United Nations by violating international Treaties signed by the United States, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
"I am not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should we attention," has déclaré-t-il for the CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior official of the fight against terrorism, rusell through, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The test of President's spokesman Barack Obama to reduce the importance of assange contrasts with the views that politicians and commentators say conservatives these days.
Peter King, congressman from January will chair the National Security Committee in the lower House asked the Department of the state that he studied the possibility of including wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to any person who provide contributions or assistance."
Further Canadian went Tom Flanagan, an advisor to President Stephen Harper, who has come back on his statements after he said that assange will "be killed."
"Obama should transform it into goal and use an unmanned aircraft or something similar."
A person who has not asked for apology has been Mike huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-gouverneur Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone who is in the government that has been leaked the information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be too kind," has déclaré-t-il punishment for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with declines of eye followers of carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret voting on its continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a more plural and the end of the system of assembly.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for resolving the umpteenth internal revolt within ERC, without North due to the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that her resignation threat is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís carod-rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted that his liar and can absolutely not give him the headaches he had with other current extinguished.
That is why the leader of esquerra will win its new criticism with declines of eye that allow it to Blinder until the municipal elections.
To start, puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 advisers to national ERC will decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising hands.
If the carodistes want to convey some penalty vote to the President, they can do without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of ranks to avoid the image of division and that of submission to him.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with over a half of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, a result "at the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to carod require the president a little more than make its position available of the militancy, a gesture that did not apply when puigcercós control the maxim body between the Congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force the resignations, they try to register with the executive a roadmap until May.
This, they hope to participate in the drafting of the document of strategic shift that management submitted to the voting of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support puigcercós in exchange for the latter's promise of scheduling the Congress for the fall of 2011, what the leaders see as a fact course.
The leader of ERC admitted that the "multiple voices" affects the stability and that its objective is to once and for all the organization is able to do his laundry room in family.
In this line, article that the current adviser Josep huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of puigcercós, the holder of innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various targets" It is as if had done.
And he listed five, which he stresses two.
The first," Reintegrate "the executive to is at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures who are adept at carod sector.
The latter may be the character of news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the Assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it represents a reform of the constitution which allows the achievement of delegates elected by Congress through suffrage.
Away with the model of assembly, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the team of puigcercós, who has struggled in the last two Congress already in this respect.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 has instructed the direction of revising the Assembly in a specific Congress of reform of the Statute.
This meeting remains incomplete, because the internal tide of recent years did not recommend discuss this.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good for The Resume and close forever.

Obama promotes Twitter the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you're in agreement with the approval of the Dream Act, called Silent senators and ask them to approve the legislation," has twitté American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the National Mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of social network Twitter.
"If you're in agreement with the approval of the Dream Act, called Silent senators and ask them to approve the legislation," has twitté Obama.
His short message is keeping open a cyber link with a further document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, because the vote for the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to hear your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican Senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the time Bush's tax cuts and the financing of government continue.
Such a stalemate, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Senate Republicans, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects as the ratification of the new treaty start with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican lock of the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is resolved a agende can be set for the rest of the projects.

But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, in moments when the partisan organizations of the protagonists intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the bill.
The Democrats, the majority of whom supported the dream Act, had 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican has expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act requires the vote several Republicans if other Democrats decided to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted there are the Republican Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Maine, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux, of Florida, who completed the mandate su Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who had in the past supported the dream Act are orrin s, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they would not support him in another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined so far posture.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, Analysts agree with the fact that the biggest of the Dream Act obstacles are in the Senate.
With the literatures you put the nail on the head
The second stage of the pleasures of the language has been a walk in which participants were display of narration
"Sex in the language, I understand that, but... the nail on the head? that sought to me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and who has used the subtitle of his question, this time for another show the panel was devoted to sex in the language, "expliqué-t-elle.
The nail on the head "Gently... is an embarrassment," launched the Argentine writer in public, most of the young, who gathered in the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, thread, to hear this table moderated by Marisol shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, mayra MONTERO and Luis García MONTERO.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo celorio that shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a player that seeks to know the "wound," it is a doctor to another without a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectious diseases it is convinced that "Patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated with the approach traumatologue which has knocked the wind in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "open wound is what is in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "On the wound I only able to know that this is in fact that is open and that it does not exist," but the fact that convinced the joys and traps of language should be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez explained as a beautiful story as he called praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not nombré but at one point is discovered.
With magic realism, he speaks of a famous keys ensorceleuse affecting the clouds, was returning from people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narrative that turns to then America, the news which was Early its own columnists and critical bernal Díaz del Castillo who cited the excesses of narratives of capitans conquerors.
"Cervantes which we all invented, the writers, false witnesses who appeared in the stories have been sidelined presented as a aitre way of real, but could not narrated the story of America with an imagination that lacked even the modesty."
Nevertheless, souligné-t-il," The Liars mad and have the best imagination 'and here the reality coincides with deception, we no longer know how much of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction reached its peak.
Call it in fact the tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is through his legacy and this is what the story."
In turn, the writer mayra montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the wire with his round table on must on the wound.
The cubaine-portoricaine has put his on the great social scourge of violence that his country faces - and Latin America share - product disputes of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, the good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not clearly premeditated ', has indiqué-t-elle after just the reality of literature is communication and size of the commitment that stands between the author and readers, and that it is a" chemical reaction "of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García MONTERO who also stressed "It must on the head of the writer engaged."
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed as regards the intellectual habits and the control of conscience that turns to the advantage of "dogmatism and behind each claim there is a small not and behind each denial there is a small yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of the reality we must differentiate: and nuance means many times put the nail on the head and disturb the people who feel very convenient in mind in caricature, black and white, also in ideas established and outright and disturb the authority who prefer a world in black and white," he says, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano in hunting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he experienced ups and downs in his career, but he managed to achieve three times the decisive series.
With the Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final duel, there are two different styles which are marked by their technicians, who find them a sharp contrast from the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he experienced ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive set, although until now it has not hit the mark and that is why this is very special occasion for him.
The Argentine eventually be content with the Medal of sous-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and surprisingly with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The strategist santiste reached his first final as coach in the opening tournament, 2002 when it took the lead morelia with which he lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca. Later, in the closing 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against rayados.
With Santos Laguna already in the 2010 tournament bicentennial, again against the new diablos, Rubén suffered a setback because its team made a game equal 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in penalties he obtained an advantage for the series 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players have missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump the outcome of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the diablos rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore it does not have the same fate, he tries to break away from the evil spell to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he contends that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to upset any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I and therefore I get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the helmsman when asked what would be its weaknesses in the finals.
He remembers much of the last final, of which he said that he had learned a lot," the only lesson we can learn is that until the final arbitrator whistles, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I think this is a lesson, before the end of the match we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be characterized by penalties, which does not worry the, because he says his players: "You never seeks to reach a series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we're prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a wrong turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of taking the title in our hands, we dropped hands, it served as a lesson for the final and we hope that we can no longer in this position."
Romano now has an opportunity not to be a sous-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the securities.

Some 70 policemen under regional survey of the Quebec's Eastern Townships of safety in Quebec, the Police Service memphrémagog police Sherbrooke and governance, took part in this operation.
Illegal migration will continue without problem
The draft law of conservatives who, according to the government, should resolve the problem ships with illegal migrants, will of course be beaten while the three opposition parties have indicated Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael ignatieff, while he was surrounded by caucus members after the meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to a year, any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that it could not support the bill because it is in the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we will see what the government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
Criticism of the NDP on immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected out of hand critics suggestion that his party is not strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"The NDP agree to measures against the smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, the c-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the draft law of conservatives because it seeks to refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," said Ms. Chow.
The Minister of immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties to play politics and to ignore the will of Canadians.

A conservative, however, told the agency qmi that the government would seek a vote for each Member who would vote against is then to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continues to call for the creation of a commission of inquiry into the matter.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert dutil, argues that this idea did not start yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation from New York to them last January.
France has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement on Tuesday found more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Standing Council on policing of Quebec, on October 29, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert dutil.
It took no more for the PQ critical for public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, calls the announcement "rabbit out of a hat" and "solution bricolée on the corner of a table."
The Minister dutil has meanwhile responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it, contente-t-il to assert itself."
"We are aware of the problem."
For the President of the csq, réjean parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Mr. Charest insists not to create this commission of inquiry, more people like you and I believe that it has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is on the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of public ethics and governance at the National School of Administration.
To break the impasse, he suggested in Quebec to give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"You must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," tranche-t-il.
It also believes that Quebec could make the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent squad is not the only project in the government Charest cartons.
Quebec also seek to Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request comes from the prosecutor of the operation hammer, who informed the Minister of Justice jean-marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is unclear in this kind of investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, meanwhile confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently examining some amendments related to this file.
During the operation spring 2001, affecting the motorcycle, even if the Criminal Code groups was not adequate, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently passed the Law on gangsterism.

DuPont partially blamé
The radio broadcaster of Quebec Stéphane partial Dupont suffered a setback to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, ccnr for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as well as his foul language in air.
The ccnr judge that Mr. Doe And his team of Choi 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain statements contained "incorrect information on social assistance, representations unduly negative of Haitians and which is not suitable for coarse language broadcasts during the day."
The Board also found that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The ccnr had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of persons social assistance of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the program were inaccurate.
Leaders must provide solid rather than misleading information.
For suicide, the moderator Stéphane DuPont had estimated that suicide is a gesture of cowardly.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that DuPont challenged the episodes of" The Noon "addressed a contentious issue of fair and appropriate."
No blame was therefore agreed to him.
The last dispute involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Doe And jean-rené dufort had then delivered to a media showdown that had generated a lot of reactions.
The leader of Choi said he had not made a donation to help them because there was no assurance that people really needy would receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is a representation unduly negative of Haitians.
"I have served my suspension of three days on this."
"My case is blank for a year and a half," said the leader.
In all decisions, the Committee denounced the dissemination of foul language.
In each case, the broadcaster choi-fm worked "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal to the station to, among others, announce these decisions once during the prime time within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montreal of Algerian origin nacereddine zemmal has a very particular journey.
The athlete who excels in "sanda," kung-fu "Full Contact," in kick boxers and boxing Thai climbs on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts as the kick boxers kung-fu and 12 years ago, in Algeria, said zemmal, installed in the Metropolis since 2008 to change among professionals."
"In my case, I look for fighting everywhere, as for those who do not like the game on the soil in mixed martial arts competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the company UPS has now issued bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Championships fan of the world karate and kick boxers Association, wka, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kick boxers Full Contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now, I'm ready to go to China for the World Cup in San shou."
"fighters who have finished in the top four at the last World Championships in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, the fifth largest in China, I have concluded the tournament, while I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting is that I have progressed at each competition."
"At this rate, I will be the first time or next year!"
The "San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where the fists and feet, as well as the ground projections, are permitted.
The shootouts are originally on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugiliste from this form of struggle is the American of Vietnamese origin cung, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If nacer zemmal was to assume that a single event in his career, will certainly his presence in the Super tournament "king of sanda," the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This is the most elevated and prestigious competition in China, said the sympathetic members."
"This is the equivalent of lumpinee stage - the biggest stage of Thailand."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in its class, 80 kg, semifinals before losing in the final.

450 million in contracts without bidding
Hydro gave privately $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of firms OPI, dessau, DM and axor group that won the most important one of the stewardship of the project for a sum of $295 million without bidding.
This consortium called Energy stewardship was established in 2004 in parallel to the choice of hydro to entrust the private sector its responsibility for managing this large hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium Energy Stewardship won the lucrative contract without that there were any public tender.
Quebec for the party, the use of consortia ethical business is a serious problem that threatens to eliminate competition and drive up prices.
"This is the new way to make the collusion and to eliminate competition."
"people, instead of making it a secret, now do it openly," said yesterday the PQ Member Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue at the National Assembly because he said see how difficult the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie normandeau, said in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for the contract.
"I began to have my trip," she pesté, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and was "inconsistent."
She said that "this is the least" that the PQ apologized.
The formula consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond in a tender for a complex project.
The project eastmain has a high level of complexity given the scope of work.
Work is under way and will run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without that the Competition Act; there were negotiations.
Also, the formula consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even relatively simple for projects.
As last week revealed the duty, the formula of consortia in the engineering sector investigated by government.
A brief overview of the register of Quebec firms can count more than 200 consortium, which some appear to permanent.
Thus, the firm dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA +, génivar, snc-lavalin and other rock and tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings to one person moral, or dessau.
With regard to the consortium energy management, the Minister normandeau stressed that "the James Bay responds to unique dynamics of labour and that hydro responds in particular since the 1970s."
The boss of the project eastmain, real Laporte, the energy company of James Bay, sebj, gave an explanation that has raises eyebrows on the fact that the management contract of the project has been granted privately.
"If you go to tender and that there is little of bidders, your price will be higher."
"You have two choices: Either you take the people who are in this marché-là and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price which is important is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to energy consortium stewardship is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 Quebec achieved by the party.
The contracts were awarded by hydro or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
After verification, the duty scored 109 engineering consulting contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 firms or their affiliates, including laboratories of soils.
Snc-lavalin won 22 contracts, génivar obtained 16, tecsult 14 and dessau 10, excluding its participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts were traded.
They account for 449 783 $344, including the contract to Energy Stewardship of $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms of the consortium, OPI, dessau group SM and axor are "well known to Liberal Party in Quebec."
The Minister normandeau dropped the PQ is also linked to these firms for the,"" before considering that it was instead of its leaders.
Barometer of "green" Responsible Consumption - the label does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer Quebec very little confidence in actors of sustainable development, but also to fair and qualifications écologisantes marks to guide its choice.
Worse, even if it is bathed in a media universe where messages in favour of a more responsible consumption are, it is a lack of credible information, brake failure that he calls even with its commitment, indicates the barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased consumption of products socially responsible in 2010, the Quebec appear to give very little credence to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say not believe the green environmental commitment of companies like advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the University Sherbrooke responsible consumption.
Another fact: half of consumers doubts about the reliability of the certification official affixed to the products fair, but also of the credibility of products and brands shown as écoresponsables, says the barometer.
In the same vein, the politicians' speeches on the theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebec.
Primary information in responsible consumption appears to stimulate this part of consumption currently led by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the dubious vacuum and the nature of the information calmeraient the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second stop identified by the barometer, after the higher prices of these products.
Moreover, a third of Quebec are also wary of the alleged performance of green products or services sought to put them in the hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
They have also helped up by 61% of purchases from traders neighbourhoods and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says the barometer.
More green and responsible - Rate of responsible consumption reached 64 on up to 100 for this year, homo consumus Quebec like present itself as the King of recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint focusing on animal protection.
But his conscience social and ecological appears to remain outside of his car, says the barometer: by 2010, only 28 percent of Quebec reported using public transit or stressed the carpool to defend their interests greens.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast Attitudinal Survey, coming to take his first picture.
A loan of the state for the redemption of excentris
The Government of Quebec, asked to commit funds in the redemption of the cinema complex excentris by Angus society and the parallel, agreed to cooperate, but only up to a loan.
Angus development society and the parallel, who hoped a gift of $7 million of the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the film excentris complex on the boulevard Saint Laurent in giving its full role cinéphilique, do not get what they wanted.
The Government agreed to become involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than expected the donation, the Quebec government proposes a loan with an initial amount would also be below expectations, which could be a viable solution on favourable terms, at least in the opinion springs from the headquarters of the state.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to the Minister st-pierre by the President of the cultural enterprise development corporation, SODEC, Francois macerola, leading the excentris kit.
He sent her a final report about 10 days ago.
But the counterproposal Cabinet came to the SODEC Tuesday.
The parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
But it seems that the assumption of the gift of the state should really be dismissed.
Recall that the owners' association of cinemas and Quebec cinéparcs objected to a direct investment of the state to support the redemption of excentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance projects, which he has not done for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders wanted rather substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, master of céans, has been for ten years at arm's length film copyright on the premises of the complex After financing his own construction, which could justify an exemption from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for the independent films is huge in Montreal, and excentris had known his customer loyalty.
Angus society and the parallel, headed by Christian yaccarini, flying, for their part, a fundraising campaign in private, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three screens, the parallel, continues to producing films to excentris.
The purpose of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February by projecting the wonderful film of Xavier beauvois men and the gods.
But Christian yaccarini did not recall the duty and it was unclear what he and his group think downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex... Canada
The new American diplomatic cables disclosed by wikileaks lifted the veil on what the United States sees as the Canadians inferiority complex towards the Americans, but they show at the same time the sense of superiority of such persons to Canada.
Thus, the Americans are surprised that voters Canadian did not Canada U.S. relations in mind in voting and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, carried out yesterday on a public square, crispy offer more details that substantial content to to eat.
A cable dated September 22 2008, is in full federal election campaign, recounted how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"An inherent Canadian inferiority complex almost guarantees domestic perhaps Canadian political leaders to talk about issues of the daily rather than focusing this election on the United States, as in the 1988 campaign on free trade," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he said, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk."
Ambassador includes less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he argued, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this vital relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind in voting."
Another expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry breese, responsible for cases in Ottawa, preparing the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"This trip will help ensure the survival of the Government at the vote of confidence early February on the federal budget, in which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan for 30 to 40 billion dollars," wrote Mr. breese.
Nowhere does it say that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and opposition parties made survival conditional on the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast CBC referral of the United States.
Ambassador is concerned about the border, little mosque emissions on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar," no-fly-list "or kidnapping as a CIA interrogation.
Another cable said that, during their first bilateral meeting his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner, Hillary Clinton has asked if Europe was ready to host some prisoners in Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, is written," he presented a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a Muslim after 15 years of Canadian."
"The secretary has agreed to review the record."
Note finally minds are mounting on the wikileaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on radio CBC that the responsible for this mass flight should be "assassinated."
He echoed of Mike huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday in Cancun a renovation plan of domestic lighting, commercial and industrial in 100 countries seeking a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which is almost a third of the further reduction that must be done to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of major concrete projects that the United Nations hoped to adopt Cancun to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduce by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday with incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompactes or, better, bulbs light bulbs Light Emitting Diodes, del or "LED" in English, the bulk of 1.8 billion tons, gt GHG issued on the planet to enlighten the people would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8 percent of the global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70 percent of the global emissions fleet.
In Copenhagen, last year, the largest emitters, like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should make the aggregate greenhouse gas emissions from 53 Gt to 49 GT.
But it was from this assessment still 5 GT in order to stabilize climate by 2020 the increase to 2 degrees centigrade so that it became out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95 percent of the energy dissipates as heat and the remaining 5 percent, proceeds of light.
With fluocompactes bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75 percent and the new bulbs to Del twice more, we reduced the need of energy.
Bulbs on average of 6,000 to 10,000 fluocompactes hours.
The new manufacturing del light bulbs, like those that launched the Philips this week - the company participated in the study of the United Nations, had a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 percent less energy than incandescent light bulb, which gives an idea of the potential savings with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rhéostats In addition to very little heat.
And they do not contain mercury.
Several experts showed reservations towards the bulbs fluocompactes because they contain mercury and that they must be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers are developing guidance.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury on the planet is not the fluocompacte bulb, but rather coal plants, which contain much mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
The United States only, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through this international program.
For example, Indonesia sparing $1 billion a year on purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 equivalent of 3.5 construction of the Thermal Power Generation would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits the nervousness in the announcement of the election results
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, claimed the "without delay" Publication of the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the deadline.
"The secretary general stressed the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a spokesman of the head of the United Nations. "
"he calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to take responsibility and to refrain from any action until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed a Wednesday midnight deadline without publishing the results Sunday, three days after the election.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the chairman of the IEC said on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have increased Wednesday in the world for the CIS finally declare the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent alassane Ouattara.
But the camp Gbagbo relies on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of votes "fraudulent" in the north, held by former rebel New Forces, fn since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of Ivorian president, said that the voter intimidation practised by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of outgoing President to vote.
The whole election could be canceled if complaints by Gbagbo retained by the Constitutional Council.
But opponents of Gbagbo after the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao did not dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
North alassane Ouattara, man who denies any links with the former rebels, was "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go to claim victory.
Its allies argue that Gbagbo blocked the results because he knows he has lost and that a complaint before the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral commission to promote the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, Sunday, was expected to top the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed lead in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of votes against 32 percent to alassane Ouattara, who received public support of former President Henri konan bédié, 25% in the first round.

Case clotilde Reiss French: the Elysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than 10 months from July 2009 in May 2010, the fate of clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for 'spying', held the opinion on tenterhooks in France, put on standby, diplomacy and deepened the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Under the watchful eye of diplomats from the United States.
The US documents obtained by wikileaks and consulted by the World reveal some short of this crisis.
French describe how the Elysée Palace outlined his strategy to Americans, up to provide guidance for the treatment of their own crises of "hostages" in Iran, a small group of hikers.
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French counterpart had not had the release of Majid kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and wanted by the American justice for trafficking materials to the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place under a harsh light the way the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, played a central role in the release of clotilde Reiss.
In reality, he was nothing.
Diplomatic telegram read on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle cases of hostages."
The French of the Elysée Palace for the strategic affairs adviser, Francois richier, accompanied by Director of Orsay dock for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice paoli, talk to the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone.
They explain the French method.
Advising Americans to do likewise to forcibly repatriate their own nationals held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, 'martelez ever "in the media the words" fundamental human rights," "Innocence," "immediate release."
It is to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Let especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because, Past attempts to discussions by discreet channels," the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "Masters of delaying tactics."
Mr. richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a tactic Iranian familiar: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announced that the release from prison of clotilde Reiss, who will speak on August 16, when she sought refuge in the Embassy of France "will require payment the Iranians of a large sum of money," 230,000 euros bail.
French and he said that the Elysée Palace anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison for 12 days, but remains stuck in Iran.
More information is available: The Iranian Majid kakavand, including the US demanded the extradition for a sensitive illegal trafficking of electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, as many observers, asked about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the Iranian clandestine networks for acquisition of equipment for nuclear programme, enlargement of Majid khakavand is bad news.
France has agreed a deal?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In another interview with Kathleen allegrone, on September 4, Francois richier ensures that this is not the case.
French the Elysée Palace, he says, not only "has been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There were some lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the guard of the Seals" at the time, not alliot-marie, but "the French Government cannot return to the judicial decision," he notes.
Mr. richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid kakavand remains under "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The French adviser of the Elysée Palace composed a telephone number, links, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris under the Iranian Embassy."
During the detention of clotilde Reiss French in Iran, the Elysée Palace would spare no efforts, through press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to believe that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is an "important" and "influential role" of "mediator."
The Americans observed this activity without irony, and noted that the manipulation bears fruit as several French press articles cut the official version.
A telegram dated August 25 2009 described "the French media blitz 'officials."
What is based on both expressed "gratitude" for Mr. Assad, asked the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials acknowledge privately that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The French paper then turned on the reasons that led the Elysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intense communications effort "to validate the policy of opening Sarkozy to Syria," analyse-t-il.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and imméritée."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria which praise she can attract by playing a constructive role in the region."
The goal is to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US Embassy is in good source.
On August 11, Francois richier had told him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we Thanks anyway."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy the French received in the Elysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, of Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favour of the release of our own."
No online games for the young Korean past midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "cendrillon" which prohibit teenagers playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to block access to these games online games after midnight, youth aged under 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play at these games throughout the night and then have difficulties to study at the school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said The AFP Jo ministerial Rin, the official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The Government also plans to ask companies to limit the time daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, added the official.
It will also make available to people who demand free software for limiting time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "connected" and newspapers report regularly current events related to extensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: FIFA selects the hosts
In turmoil because of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee Thursday refers the hosts of the World Cups 2018 and highly political 2022, an election where the influence and Lobbying may take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the QUEEN OF THE FIFA competition will take place in Europe, traditional stronghold of discipline, 4 candidates: Britain, Russia, espagne-portugal, pays-bas-belgique -.
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to win new territories, Qatar, Australia, after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its location in the United States, Japan, South Korea or in the Far East.
The list of persons part of delegations, David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch, Zidane, beckham, Heads of Government cruyff, gives the extent of a global economic and political issues.
Negotiations in scenes are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of FIFA, the English files, hispano-portugais, 2018 and American, 2022 have better arguments that their competitors.
But this does not will weigh heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension of corruption from two members of this, reynald temarii and Amos Adamu, could have ruined the chances of his country, cradle of football that is hosting the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC presented a layer, Monday, sharing a documentary that three senior members of the pin, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou.
What discontent FIFA and embarrassing English officials, who are engaged in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in front line.
The head of government hopes to repeat the shot succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had secured in 2005 to London the organization of jo-2012.
This intense activity suffice to raise the profile of England from this?
Nothing is less safe because the duo espagne-portugal do not lack of assets with its stages ready, expertise, mondial-82 in Spain, jo-92 in Barcelona, euro-2004 soccer in Portugal and culture.
But the bleak economic and fiscal outlook in both countries could shower stall their ambitions.
The retaliation against the English and doubts about the quality of Spain and Portugal only increase the symbol of Russia, become an outsider weight despite the gaps in its file, stadiums, hotels, transport.
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel in Zurich and condemned "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a veiled reference to the English press charges against members of the EC.
"on the covers of mud, attempts to the compromise," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, emerged as the favorites logical.
First World economic power, headquarters of key sponsors of FIFA, the country appears to be a step ahead of Japan and South Korea separately, who built a beautiful project.
But these new candidates appear premature for two countries having organised jointly test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of mondial-2026 to China, eagerly anticipated by FIFA, which would in fact Asian eliminates the chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has entered the Great Game in offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA will continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries are more likely than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights acquitted, because of the time difference, by the European countries, the heart of the war for the FIFA.
Second term: the evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitate.
Mitterrand had given the impression that he was.
Valéry Giscard d estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A French mandate at the Elysée Palace deserves another.
So the current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not mix with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then there should be as if the doubt still existed.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even without believe, the Friends of Jacques Chirac insists that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a major air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that he would take his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011."
He speaks before French parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two terms" thus created a little volatility.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was further.
President did emphasise that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of quinquennats.
It was a fact, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he mentions the presidential, on the tone of humour, during these meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you're still for seven and a half years with me," They had launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not think that I am not considering the following step."
His remarks on Monday did not make it more candidate the day before; they do not make it less.
If they are comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the PS nomination, of a share.
But it is not the substitution of Ségolène Royal leads Nicolas Sarkozy to disclose.
Rather, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many of the PS require sorting of battle earlier than expected.
The wrong polls, on the other.
For the first time right voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy, 46 percent to 44 percent, according to bva-l' Express.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on that," immediately and cautiously responded the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the defeat possible, it will not be a candidate," says Kevin Raffarin.
"he believes still to win, corrects Alain juppé, resigned to the evidence."
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, ECB of the year should be an occasion to clarify terms to end the crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of operations not conventional monetary policy that are achèver at the end of the year.
Sovereign debt crisis European dictates, the Institute of issuing Frankfurt also may not allow itself to be conclusive under penalty of worsen the situation more tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, in a press conference, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, and welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the crisis of debts of states in Europe.
She declined to say whether she believed that the Central Bank should do more, such as increasing its purchases of sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my reflection to European partners...."
The previous day, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Trichet, the President of the ECB has not shown more information to appear about its intentions, merely to indicate that the security state in the secondary market "acquisition program continued" and that "We will see what we decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its key rate unchanged at historic percent, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.
In fact, the Treasury bond purchases by the ECB have doubled last week, at nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the leaks of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish titles and Portuguese, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem purchased for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market participants, expectations of further purchases are no doubt, see page 29.
Economists expect not significant change of course.
If the lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still to unlimited cash allowances according to generous and conditions for periods from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that the device could be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine that it significantly changes its program."
"otherwise it would take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist with the commerzbank.
"A gradual removal announced during the first quarter 2011 is likely," anticipates his side Norbert bräms, economist at Sal.

In terms of its intervention in the market of the public debt," the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to facilitate a weak market," Norbert bräms.
Given the importance of sovereign debt exhibitions of European banks to markets emission in the euro area, The Institute has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.

In Italy, the government Berlusconi made the round back
After a week beginning worrying for Italy, the situation has eased a bit, yesterday, with the tide of bond rates in 10 years.
A return to calm precarious.
After a meeting with the Minister of the economy, the Presidents of region reported hearing Giulio tremonti call the situation of "unbreakable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable," which he then denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the long rates Germans had reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy, CDs, had soared to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with the German rate was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, gianni letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by "the turbulence" and a possible spillover from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third in the euro area economy, is not as Greece and Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," said Irwin stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenue that goes with, that puts the state funding may not be able to meet its needs.
The latest forecast in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1 percent in 2011 and 1.4 percent in 2012... so that the budget under consideration in the Senate panel on 1.3 percent and 2 percent respectively.
In these conditions, the European Commission, calculates the public deficit is still 4.3 percent of GDP next year, compared to 3.9 percent forecast by the Government and 3.5% in 2012, instead of 2.7 per cent.
Hence the rumor of a new collective budget that could be put in place after the holidays, for a total of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will be taken," says the Economic Affairs Commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of the economy are in order and its accounts are good, we reiterate long," took arrigo sadun Italian, the administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy in the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, nor on the short or on the long term, because in spite of its substantial debt, 119.2 percent of GDP in 2011, Ed, the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested to other countries," observed Pier Carlo padoan, OECD chief economist.
Remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi address a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held in late March.
Would then a period not conducive to the decision in case of serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of devices crisis
Christine Lagarde has been hammered yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that it has again demonstrated Sunday in the day and into the night, were obviously solidarity, determined and committed to defend their currency and monetary zone."
Although relative, the trigger registered yesterday on bond rates of European state brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot even speak of a beginning of normalization.

The countries who are the first line, Portugal and Spain, in turn, were preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of organization of the labour market.

Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Episodes snowy still cause difficulties of movement, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and disrupt some economic activities.

The remains, the eure-et-loir, the deux-sèvres and the Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in orange, 18 since Wednesday afternoon vigilance and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde later in the night.
According to weather France, snow showers supported the north of the Gironde and affect the charentes and snow poorly on the ile-de-france.
Layers of snow from 2 to 5, 7 to 10 punctually cm, were expected for the departments concerned, and 1 cm to 3 cm and up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the charente, charente-maritime coasts of armor, finistère, Gironde, poitou and those of the Regions Dordogne, basse-normandie, ile-de-france and limousin.
Snow episodes are significant enough to cause problems of movement and disrupt some economic activities, warning weather France.
In the coasts of armor several County were banned in the heavy weight of more than 7.5 tons, which guingamp-lannion and saint-brieuc-loudéac axes.

Metro large financial PARIS: first drawings
Since the time that the debate about the modernization of transport in ile-de-france is in full swing, the billions fell.
At least in the discussion.
It referred in particular to 23 billion for the Metro great Paris to build the Great Society Paris.
To start this GSP, the Government has announced an investment capital of 4 billion euros.
In the conceptual design is this sum that will follow the GSP to borrow from the markets a share of funding for his double loop.
Today, we finally arrived in the first additions.
The Finance Law Amendment 2010, examined in Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains arrangements to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and an increase in the tax offices in ile-de-france.
The first, according to the text of the draft law Article 15, is "for the benefit of the institution of the great Paris society."
It is encrypted: "the product of the tax is to 117 million euros per year."
The second is a redevelopment of a tax offices that already exists "to modernize, to increase the product and allocate this increase to the great Paris' society.
That would how?
Mystery.
This is not specified in the text.
It is away from 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these tax money is in addition to 4 billion euros of investment, which will be raised by the state and made to the Great Society Paris to the project as," "reads the statement of reasons.
Has the GSP, there is no this shocking system.
"As long as it developed recipes, both taxes, Ed, we can cover the studies on three years after then type within 4 billion, can there."
"This will be enshrined in the budget and fired as measure."
The SGP believes that the 4 billion start to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
The device, in which the 4 billion promised are still gone quiet, threatens to cause a parliamentary discussion a little rough.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers revenge and spies in diligence
The case wikileaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal only before the hypocrisy that regulates the relationship between the states, the people and the press.
On the other, she said profound changes at the international level, and points to a future dominated by the decline.
But are in order.
The first aspect of wikileaks, is the fact that each file compiled by a Secret Service, of any nation is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The American "extraordinary" revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report which for months could be read in any newspaper, except those whose Berlusconi owns, and the khadafi profile direly caricature was long for the cabaret artists substance to sketch.
The rule that the secret files should be composed only of new already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore to esoteric publications, you will find that every book, repeated on the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-château, the templiers or the previous rose-croix exactly what was written in the books.
And not only because the author of texts hidden don't like doing original research, nor know where to seek new on the nonexistent, but because those who are committed to the occult only believe in what they already know, and who reconfirmed what they had learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy, or of mind limited the head of intelligence, otherwise it could be, whatever, editor of liberation, that is as true that that it recognizes.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome sent to the Department of State were the same as those that Newsweek released the week before.
So why the revelations on these files did so many noise?
On the one hand, they say that every cultured person knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of states can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, lost their diplomatic service and, except for some small exercises representation, have turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer films investigation knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that there pretending to ignore it.
However, the fact of the publicly reiterate violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to place under a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker to capture the most secret SECRETS OF THE most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Also the scandal is not in crisis both victims that the "executioners."
But now to the nature of what happened.
Once at the time of Orwell, you could see any power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Prophecy Orwellian was completely proven since, capable of controlling every movement through telephone, each transaction, the hotel visited, the highway is total and so on, the citizen became the victim of the eye of power.
But when they are now shows, as it happens, that even the crypts secrets of power can't escape the control of a hacker, the monitoring report ceases to be extended and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the citizen's hacker - elected as vengeful - may hear all the secrets of power.
How a power that can no longer has the ability to retain its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg simmel already said, A true secret is a secret vacuum, and secret empty can never be unveiled; it is true, too, that all about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a secret empty of secrecy, because in the public domain; but as did wikileaks, reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secret means to render any power.
Wikileaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has made it a too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound to a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the state will no longer put online - that would be to publish the reserved no information on a poster pasted around the corner.
But it is also clear that with the current technology, it is futile hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a Head of State has shifted in aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future the private reports and reserved?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore novel, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move quietly in uncontrollable steps to routes, enabling by having that messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the little information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copy in drawers locked: basically the attempt of watergate was less successful than wikileaks espionage.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the telegraph has revolutionized communications, wireless Internet has restored a telegraph on son, telephone.
Videotapes, analog had allowed researchers in film to explore a film step by step, moving forward and back and in seeing all the secrets of installation, but now the CD, Digital will only jump from chapter by chapter, i.e. macroportions.
With high speed trains, it ranges from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in air, and it includes travel, it takes three and a half hours.
So it is not extraordinary that the policy and communications technologies in return for cars on horseback.
A final comment.
Previously, the press tried to understand what was going in the privacy of embassies.
Now, it is the embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France bidouille its pledges
One year after the agreement of Copenhagen, it is time to consider the respect of pledges quickly released, said fast start or early funding made by the developed countries.
And big bidouillages French surface.
In the agreement of Copenhagen, developed countries are committed to provide 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros, or 420 million annually.
At the opening of the cop16, the EU has removed the Great Game to persuade its partners in the reality of its commitment regarding the fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, major side event, distribution of pamphlets...
The transaction transparency is significant and appreciated: developing countries and civil society like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announcement have reached in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on the right track to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at in detail, things are more complicated.
That money should be, according to the agreement of Copenhagen," new and additional," to ensure that extra effort did not be at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what means "new and additional."
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some Member States including France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him better.
For example, the European Commission has considered the year 2009 Reference: the international funding are maintained, and she added 150 million over three years under the fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France believes that the funding of "All new projects" in the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years expenditures or the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total support of France to developing countries can remain stable, or even decline, she claimed respect its commitment to "new and additional funding..."
Another critical element, the split between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its method of calculation.
Some, like France, who think 1 EUR loan equals 1 and given.
Obviously, it is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans may be justified for some investments that are profitable, often linked to the mitigation projects based on more efficient technologies, it is misleading to present a euro that we will recover as equivalent to one euro you give... at most, should not be counted as part of its commitments that the cost of loan for the lender, the equivalent of an interest rate.
But France has no use for such an argument: it "respects" its commitment to 420 million euros while 91.5% ready, 389,8 million euros and 8.5 percent of donations, 36.1 million euros - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country of the Union to use if a loan.
Germany are required to 46 percent, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia or other respect their commitments with 100 percent of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is 1 EUR to meet its commitment, France does that 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A trick!
In summary, in its funding fast start, France makes a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in time and secondly the reality of the financial effort.
In spending only 36.1 million euros, she can do believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance, as it appeared that bercy had achieved double the arbitration could have a negative impact, both within the EU, why the other Member States would continue to give you are only pay? "and negotiations as developing countries are not completely fooled...
Early chapter of funding is only a question of relative short term, compared to the whole discussion on climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in the vast machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France could signal a change in the accounting treatment for the years 2011 to 2012, in a spirit of respect of its commitments and equality with other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could promote the discussions on the issues of financing to long term, another critical chapter currently being discussed: there will not escape the question of "additionality," or the way for loans.
France may change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is based on the new Minister of Environment, Ms. kosciusko-morizet, due to Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start for France and its vision of "additionality," and the use of loans would likely increase the level of international confidence to advance in the discussions.
Warning to pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 interfering in one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published Wednesday of the Association future generations, former movement for the rights and the respect for future generations.
The association, which warned that its results "have no statistically significant value in view of the low number of samples tested, but is illustrative of the issue dealt with, purchased between July and September food usually consumed in four and a encas meals for one day for a child of a dozen years in the supermarkets in the Oise and Paris.
These meals types, including the formal recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sweets, were reviewed by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The results of the base is overwhelming: 81 carcinogenic chemicals that 42 are classified or potential and five carcinogenic substances classified some well as 37 substances that act as endocrine disrupters, EP, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants potentially carcinogenic and/or MOU is worrying," said the association.
Breakfast contain milk, butter and tea alone more than a dozen possible carcinogenic waste and three proven to cause some and nearly 20 of hormone residues likely to disrupt the system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, made in the study, as encas presents traces of six chemicals that a fungicide but banned in France.
Same for Kenya's green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Patty, canned tuna, and even the wand of bread and the chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
Salmon for dinner, the steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the review of plastic used to heat the microwave meal attitude was not free.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminants" cocktails "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe ecologie-les Greens, ee-lv, for its part, has proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization."
In July, a study from the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA contained residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
