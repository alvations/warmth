Food guilty at European inflation
The food prices in a fast way increasing are main reason for the rise of the inflation measured in the euro zone.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was in November higher than expects - after that 2.6 percent in October was registered an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent, reported as the Statistical Office the EU in Luxembourg.
Official predictions took only 3 percent as a basis,Bloomberg announced.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank (EZB) did not lower the Leitzsins. According to your discretion the increasing raw material prices and the easy drop of the unemployment would favor the origin of an inflationary spiral the reduction of the rate of interest.
The EZB is eager to hold the inflation rate under two percent, or at least just at the two Percent-brand.
According to an analyst the EZB is in the fix: One must "arrange" the inflation in order to exclude later action need.
With 3,3 percent the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve Year record high; in Spain the rate climbed from 3,6 on 4,1 percent.
The climbed food and energy prices are responsible for the rise of the inflation in the euro zone.
The MATIF wheat notations climbed around 88 percent, and the course in soybeans reached also a record high since 1973.
Also with edible oil and milk products there was aconsiderable price increase in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased this year around 52 percent - in the last month the price reached dollar to almost 100 US per barrel of the black gold.
According to the EZB the inflation will climb in the year 2008 from 2,1 on 2,5 percent, however, one counts in 2009 with a drop on 1,9 percent.
For the coming 3-4 months analysts take a 3-percent inflation rate as a basis, number the annual average rate, however, with 2,1 percent.
For 2008 experts reckon that the EZB will decrease the intereststwice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz-sympathizers grew until beginning of December considerably. First times since 2002 the party has the biggest base warehouse while the approval was reaching a never yet been low of 13 percent for the socialists according to Gallup.
With the party-loyal voters the difference turns out thanks to the high determination of the opposition proponents clearly: More than two thirds (71 percent) stand a fifth (20 percent) opposite approval for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: You come in the total population to two percent.
The number of the party voters grew in bothwarehouses around a percent.
In the comparison to the last low the general economical atmosphere kept on worsening - never before yet the part of those that judge the economic position of the country "badly" as being "expressed" was not so high (41 percent) while further 46 percent of them are holding for "quite bad".
According to more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation once again more pessimistic.
For the coming year the majority of the population reckons a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth goes out of an improvement.
A Gallup-inquiry carried out in December showed that 71 % of the interviewees - a historical high - "judged" the work of the prime minister as bad "rather than right".
Thirteen percent of the interviewees have great confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány while the part of the proponents is forming 38 percent for Viktor Orbán.
In about 54 % do not trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27 % of distrust of the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of those, mine, one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister also without government changes into the grip.
Had themselves to the riots in last October still expressed 35 % for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government, this part amounts today only to another 20 % while the relative majority (33 percent) is seeing the solution only in new choices.
Asked for their interest at the plebiscite answered 60 percent, that they participate "with security", and would give further 20 % their vote "probable".
For the comparison: if the parliament choices occurred on this Sunday, only 55 percent "with security" would go to the urns, further 15 % hold their participation for "probable". Faced with these tendencies the result of the plebiscite would be forseeable.
74 % would become against the tuition fees, 79 % against the practice fee, and 84 % against the hospital day money make.
Moved onto the group that at the plebiscite "with security" The parts of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would become to participating even 81, 84, and/or 89 percent are.
Auchan at the most expensive, increased to Tesco around almosta fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaoerser commercial field retained also this year the average increase in prices of 16 % of the last year, with the difference that there was not any rise of the value added tax this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaoerser commercial triangle the "Napi" increased around 16 percent the price of the usual Christmas basket also this year, however in all hypermarkets increases in prices of more than 1.000 HOOF were registered.
After the prices "galloped off" in the food markets in last December, the price increase did not turn out prozentuell drastically, compared with the anyhow high, former initial level.
However works determined it onto the consumers quenching, that which they had paid HUF for in the last year still far under 9.000 of this year even for 10.000 is available TO HUF.
The price of the "Napi" Market basket crossed the magic one 10. 000-HOOVES-HUF Borders around at least 91 in the examined markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HOOF.
(In 6800 the price suited TO HUF at 6.800.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish almost remained on previous year level, strong on the other hand the prices for turkey hen breast fillets, nut and poppy have climbed.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians, at Auchan there was 1 kg bread loaf, however, for 139 forint.
It did not give up with the product any collapse ofprices due to competition less than 200 forint.
Also the price of one was surprising here two liters of Coca-Cola returnable bottle of less than 200 forint, thus the drink cost HUF including pledge only in 257.
Nevertheless Auchan at the most expensive, and Cora at the most favorable cut off this year in the "Napi" Market basket comparison.
Our calculations made, that Cora the prices in the "Napi" Market basket opposite the Christmas prices in the last year at 15, while Tesco and Auchan were increasing each about 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the heurigen year was 12 %, during the rise between cheapest market basket of the last year and formed most expensive the current year's 21 %.
The average price climb was 1.480,00 HOOF.
The average increase in prices was still enclosed in the previous year 1.206,00 forint, however, the value added tax increase became noticeable with the prices of too last Christmas.
Exactly this process found the trade badly: Seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they are supposed to use with the single articles since the effects of the increase in prices on the consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the trader plans the rotation speed of a product badly, it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the traffic intensity.)
Mehwertsteuer-relatively the price increase of the "Napi" Market basket turned out in the last year so radically, that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 forint, wohingegen the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was.
This year such extremes were not observed, there the most expensive basket about 1.630,00 forint more cost, when in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price climb of 1.284,00 forint.
In the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons a catastrophic increase in prices was proved, the price of the daily consumption articles in the hypermarkets increased in little as 20 months around more than 30 percent.
(This in turn confirms not unconditional the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians: Near some basic foods the Statistical office found a more than 30-prozentige price increase in the period of 12 months.
So in about next to flour also near eggs.)
One flings a look, however, into the "Napi" Market basket, this shines at Latter almost impossible, since the price level of the product expensive already in the previous year did not go up around hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously there are flour suppliers in a stronger position, as the Eilieferanten - after all they could shift the drastic increase in prices to the Multis.
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; People report constantly about good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look at the prices anymore at all in the three department stores.
Great amounts are bought from everything, lasting foods go in palettes above the counters.
Wednesday morning there were in all three department stores endless snakes with the cash when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.
However, a smaller customer frequency is told by the country so that many Multis complain with the pollsters, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and indeed not only with foods, but also near lasting consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are economized on
Became wage more than a thousand infections in hospitals that were to be put down to an inappropriate contact with antibiotics registers.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the personnel - everything factors, that the embankment of the infections not just zuträglich are, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places people save also near the disinfectants.
In the traumatology-department of the János hospital a MRSA-infection was diagnosed recently.
The bacterium resistant against antibiotics was found in a masculine patient who was hospitalized after a hard accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was here already a similar infection.
The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital, little later the man had to return, however, with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet.
Until 10th December of this year 1094 infections activated by multiresistant exciters onto the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System were announced from hospitals, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, infections activated by multiresistant exciters were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, the darkness digit might be, however, higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were activated to that from the MRSA against Methicillin-Oxacillin of resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness.
SA-conditional infections (as about inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
The means are proportioned, however, too highly or used inappropriately, arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics-resistant, that expand quickly under corresponding conditions in the hospitals.
In particular with patients with immune system weakened, or functioning badly permanently, however also in older, or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections, as for instance wound infection or blood poisoning, that is sepsis, cause.
According to the medical conductor of the János hospital the MRSA-infection is not anything special, such incidents appertain to the sick person house everyday life.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there are not MRSA only over there, where it is not searched.
Resistant against antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff bears rubber gloves and masks during the supply, and we have the antibiotics, necessary for the treatment," - so Tibor Nyulasi.
With their admission into the hospital the patients are examined indeed for MRSA, nevertheless an infection can always not be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections activated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the conditions currently being there and circumstances are unfavorable for the embankment of the origin or the spreading of the multiresistant exciter, Karolina Böröcz says.
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should examine the hospitals and MRSA-infected immediately isolate.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised, however, so frequently.
Last but not least because it vonseiten the state health insurance no subsidies for this investigation gives.
Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA-infection, according to the medical head of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics to Vonseiten of the European Union in the humane medicine, there are, however, guidelines also in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise, that is, microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form itself, however, this directive is not always kept by hospitals either.
Among the itinerant ones, or themselves in the basic supply of contained patient microbiological sampling are even even rarer, so Karolina Böröcz.
People save near the disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is transmitted on the other one by the nursing staff from a patient most frequently.
Just therefore the manual washing, or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance, however, there are also on this field considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, in the domestic hospitals always the possibility to isolate the infected patient does not exist, however.
The rooms are even often full, the beds just at each other follow, although there should be a distance of at least 1,5 meters between them from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz keeps on saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near disinfectants saves there are few nurses, many patients - everything factors that almost favor the origin of infections.
Such infections are nachweislich far less frequent there, and/or the further circulation of the exciter, where these protective measures are kept to can be stopped, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Therefore agreeing with MRSA-infections into the grip causes enormous costs to the health insurances they are combated everywhere.
In England for example the prevention of MRSA, and/or their embankment was held in the government program.
According to first signs the program is successful - as published data prove, the tendency of the MRSA infections is regressive in England.
The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant exciters (under that also MRSA), as soon as the prevention of infections declares as one of his priorities in hospitals.
Death steering wheel police chief was not drunk
In the case of the of the police chief of the XXII. Bezirkes caused car accident's there is the official expert opinion with fatal exit now.
The police chief in the meantime stepped back of the XXII. District's that killed a pedestrian on Tuesday at a car accident, was not either gotten drunk, still under drug influence, Attila Morvai, the press agent of the Budapester upper prosecution on Friday, said after the official expert opinion was presented for the case.
The expert opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation according to which the police chief had not consumed any alcohol before he sat down at the steering wheel.
The former police chief turned with his own Pkw in the XXII. District into the Kossuth Lajos street one and ran over in this case one 55 year man, that crossed the street at a not marked place.
(According to StVO this is not, however, a moderating circumstance - the steering wheel has Nachrang even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the zebra crossing.)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries according to his admission into the hospital.
According to police reports the steering wheel suffered a shock, covered after that his functions and requested superannuation.
The Budapester prosecution initiated their investigationsfor the incident.
Furthermore Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief from the beginning co-operated with the observers.
Further 400 million € for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, vice-president three credit agreements signed on Friday in Budapest to the European Investment bank (EIB) in the total value of 400 million €. The money is supposed to flow into education, traffic and environmental protection-infrastructure and power industry.
The European Investment bank (EIB) granted in the year 2006 one to 300 million € frame for the financing of traffic and environmental protection projects which are realized with subsidies of the cohesion fund. The banking agreement above 100 million was signed already formerly, in the current descendant it is a question of the use of the verliebenen 200 Mio €.
The sum of 150 million € agreed in the loan agreement is supposed to be spent also onto the budgetäre financing of education projects.
The EIB granted in total 300 million € for this purpose for Hungarians; the use of the remaining 150 million € is decided on later within the framework of the expansion of the banking agreement.
In the field innovation the contracting parties signed an agreement about 50 million € which will mainly flow into research and development programs at the university Debrecen.
During the meeting also the subway line 4 was brought up.
It was arranged, that as soon as Hungarians clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, to be discussed the initial contract and possible modifications once again.
According to János Veres this would be in the first quarter 2008possible.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed in total 113 projects in the total value of 8,4 billion € in Hungary.
The credit interests are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided from the EIB with a delay of 8 years commission-freely.
Bulgaria, the immovable-paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian property market is fabulous - whole Europe looks attentively at the Balkans state formerly rarely mentioned.
What, where, and who the EU that, however, becomes in a fast way more expensive buys at the still cheapest market?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the most sought after plaster for immovable purchases in the East European room, with favorable ski studio apartments and houses at the sea.
Between the mountains the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa number among the most popular, at the sea Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar are the runners, however, immovables are asked to more ever around Kavarna and Balcik.
To attract investors according to assessments of Re/Max analyst in Bulgaria wid also the inland sooner or later, so for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the distinctly favorable area of Russe records more buyers.
The capital Sofia offers also enticing offers - commercial and office faces offer highest net yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and to attract tourists thus next to the summer and winter season also in the two other seasons.
Foresighted investors shop therefore already now in the great style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts people who acquire immovables in Bulgaria strive also for a change of their conduct.
Most buyers are English, also prospective customers come, however, from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present while there are being mainly Russian buyers near the Black Sea and in the ski fields.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgarien, says.
Those that want to sit down either revitalisierte immovables buy euro, or houses come down around 5-15.000 around 50-100.000 euro, that renovate it then themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are written in a large way, but also the proximity to a city, businesses and doctors are decisive for the buyers.
Those appertain to the second category, who are in search of a vacation residence (Bulgaria was listed in December under the top Ten Urlaubszielen of the Germans).
Businessmen define the third group, that with the objective of one middle- to long-term accretion invest.
Meanwhile immovables in the capital become constantly more expensive, necessitated by the always wachsende demand.
Within the EU the immovable prices are lowest indeed in Bulgaria, in the last five years there was a price increase, however, around annual 21 percent.
The price increase with the immovable prices exceeds the increase of the salaries by far.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings end on Tuesday, and the debate about the international climate-regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss about the timetable of Bali, in which the emission-reducing measures for the time after 2012, therefore after the Kyoto protocols, defined are.
Currently a vehement debate is in progress between industry and development countries.
The USA signaled already that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however, they would be ready to reduce the hothouse gas emissions around 25-40 percent to 2020 in comparison with 1990.
The other great question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready next to the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financial, than to support also technologically.
Also an agreement about the support was achieved by developing countries.
The one subordinated to the Kyoto protocols adaptation fund is supposed to be administered by a 16-headed council, probable at the Globalen Umweltfazilität (GEF) of the UNO, as in the "Piac és profit" is to be looked up.
Hungary's six percent
The attempt of the EU to retain their role of the pioneer with global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009 supports environmental minister Gábor Fodor on behalf of Hungary.
The minister that becomes EU until in 2020 the hothouse gas emissions reduce around 20 % (measured by the values by 1990) declared independently of that whether the "Getting off after 2012" is achieved successfully, or not. The union would be even ready to support a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other great industrial countries of the world, and/or developing countries also ready are, their obligations according to strengths and to come later responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the aim of the states that had joined the Kyoto protocols in 1997 was a reduction only of 5,2 percent wohingegen the EU with theirs then 15 member states already for a minus of 8 % had obliged.
The handicap for Hungarians says reduction of the hothouse gas emissions around 6 % in comparison with the years 1985-87 - a handicap that will absolutely fill the country as in the press release of the environmental ministry is to be looked up.
The use is high on Bali - after all the long-term international climate-political agreement must be within two years ready, otherwise it would come into force with security first after 2012. In This Case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects defined in the Kyoto protocols, whose importance also the IPCC has emphasized, the scientific climate change committee of the UNO in his recent report international, honored with the Nobel peace prize.
Through that the emission reduction would be delayed, and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more that would result extremely fatal and irreparable consequences in the consequence according to Wissenschaftern than 2°C would be unavoidable.
British army recruits on YouTube
Units of the British army published photos about operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for the purpose of popularity increase on the video portal.
First of all the British air force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan load since March 2006 videos about operations led against the Taliban into the net, the BBC tells.
The photos turned with miniature cameras attached on helmets are controlled at the air force foothold in Kandahar and sent then to London, where they are put into the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Soldiers of the air force contributed in already 139 such photos, was had at their "channel" a look more than 75.000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense became under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring 2007 also the British Department of State (Commonwealth Office) registers in order to publish videos, however, about Iraqi and Afghan operations and the international peace troops stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally the air force recruited the videos with the objective soldiers, publishes, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions serve also the purpose for informing the population of the actual objectives of the foreign actions.
Such kind's published propaganda is almost free in comparison with traditional television commercials, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however, these videos always take a certain measure of political message into themselves since they confirm the right to exist of the military measures decided on by the government in own way.
Recruiting Americans with game
The army must fight, however, also against amateur photos that get it also into the net next to the carefully dealt, zensurierten photos - as about such that show the death of the soldiers: In the a little hypocritical, "official" propaganda films talks about the losses at most, the bloody pages of the war are not shown, however.
From the theaters of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan after all already numerous videos turned in the use were loaded onto the platform, the Britons discovered this "type" only recently, however, for themselves.
Meanwhile the Americans recruit in the a little different way, indeed with the freely herunterladbaren firing-game "America's Army" in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier within the framework of a more or less life-loyal simulation.
Christmas celebration with tombola and Pogatsche in theministries
Work minister Mónika Lamperth is not by any means oversensitive: Instead of a Christmas celebration she organizes a work conference in the case of which their employees can make the year 2007 finish with coffee and Pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live-music, other ones conjure Christmas atmosphere with tombola or activating into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and sideboard - so the powercelebrates.
The Christmas fever already captured also the offices.
The greatest Christmas celebration of a ministry is kept off heuer in the defense department, however, the employees of the ministry are not expected for this purpose.
During the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" is given to children by fallen soldiers presents, during the "mission celebration" member of the family is served by soldiers stationed currently abroad, there is, however, also a reception for the press.
The department provides about 25 million for the ceremonies.
In Comparison with other departments the National agency for development (NFUE) and the ministry for economy and traffic beat above the ropes.
The 4.32 Mio forint expensive Christmas celebration of the economic ministry is kept off in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The emphasis of the ceremonies lies indeed on Christmas, there will be, however, also Live-Acts and a tombola drawing by lot.
The National agency for development (NFUE) stopped theirs 4,7 million forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the house of the country justice council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forint, the rest was distributed for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information a department of the NFUE is invited also at another Christmas celebration that is given from the Hungarian business trend center (Zrt LIKES) of EU-money.
For the celebration the building of the comedy ("Vígszínház") was rented.
These information did not confirm that one LIKES Zrt since we did not reach the responsible ones.
To what the suit?
The OIT building did not stand only to the guests of the NFUE, but also the ministry for justice and police being that kept off the Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7th December.
You did not have to pay any rent to the OIT for the using of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The ceremonies with an address of the minister were started, after the dinner there was live music to the dance.
On request of [origo] one informed: No ball dress or suit duty existed at the ball.
The ministries for health, work, and self-government prepare themselves for puritanical celebration in each case.
The Department of Health, Education and Welfare gives the celebration for the employees in the own four walls for about 400.000 forint.
Work minister Mónika Lamperth summons their employees officially garnicht for a Christmas celebration, but for the conference for the year finale.
One reckons about 180 guests, that - so the press department - only coffee and Pogatsche to be served to, goes out so the celebration with 350.000 forint.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai will simply drink a toast with his colleagues only in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Exchequer (PM) gives a Christmas celebration in the own festival room to which 436 employees are expected.
The editions calculated with 2.500 forint per person - around this money there is a sideboard reception with subsequent activating.
Since beginning of the term of office of János Veres the employees of the PM celebrate every year in this way.
No correct party atmosphere will arise, however - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The agriculture ministry loads at the 20th January for a New Year reception, the Christmas celebration of the ministry precipitates this time.
One asks the a hundred guests into the castle Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information of the department the editions are with 1.000 forint per guest are calculated.
As the press department announces, it becomes a very simple standing-reception to which only in Hungary accredited foreign diplomats are summoned.
The receptions which are organized every year begin traditionally with a short address of the minister and finish with reserved feasting.
As the enstprechenden press offices on [origo] inquiry announce, neither it does not become at the Aussen- still to give a Christmas celebration near the education ministry.
Asked for the costs of the Christmas celebration one could not give any information near the press department of the environmental ministry.
Anyway more than 400 guests for the celebration that is organized in the arts and crafts museum were invited.

In the view of the department of risk analysis (Risk Analysing Division) of Political Capital the activities began the Hungarian's founded in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" guard the risk Hungary's and the region's in several respect.
In the "risk warning report" of the institute it is called among other things: In Connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard the highest political risk sets the "sharpening of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary dar, that could lead to violent ethnic quarrels even at short notice".
Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which presumably aims at the provocation of such a quarrel, according to the research institute.
How tells looks this as a lapse on the part of the political persons responsible: "Persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma-question with representatives of radical political grouping who now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian-contrast".
One presumes, that this the problem intensify, to make the reasonable dialog impossible, extremities favor as soon as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.
The Forschungsinsitut in addition thinks the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have last but not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad considerably damaged, in particular what "affects" the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity.
We remember: Since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is continuous in Hungary in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several were founded, "national self-defense association" naming organizations.
"This grouping is common, that they call themselves as civilian organization in each case while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - defense tasks of preparing (Disaster protection, national defense, Ordnungshütung), under appointment on the unsuitability of the police, the army, and/or the state itself," called it.
And wider: That all happens according to that method, that one attempts to camouflage as middle class initiative attempts different, based onto the political and party moroseness of the population, political.
The stress of the civilian character and the association form are only not used therefore for the avoidance of juridical hurdles that could emerge in the course of the registration near court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As is to be understood from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relationships with the neighboring states.
"In the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighboring states as a potential safety hazard, some ultranationalistischer politician of certain neighbor countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of his own anti-Hungarian politics.
That all has effects on the political stability of the region -" it was called".
From the Viewpoint of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in central-east-Europe, thus the political risk increased for the entire region.
As tells, the activities are comparable to the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation in August 2007 was announced of the right-extreme Bulgarian's National union (BNU).
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the Roma mass outrages which occurred in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) stood.
The BNU took as an opportunity the incidents for the foundation of the National Guard now, with the argument that the objective of the organization is the "national protection".
In your opinion a regular "gypsy terror" was indeed perceptible in the last 17 years in Bulgaria, the state remained, however, idle and indifferent - so Political Capital.
And wider: The initiative would have kicked a vehement debate loosely in the Bulgarian public.
As saidly, the increased risk for ethnic quarrels is proved also by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance purposes.
There the activities of the Hungarian Guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard shows, not to exclude it is, that the Hungarian Roma also, it means to react to the threats with the organizing of their own protection, in the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director with Political Capital said on demand the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually risk analysis reports would be published, and should be recognizable risk-changing tendencies, the public opinion is informed, as in the case through the publication of the risk warning-report.
High days are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary holidays are controlled so that the practice of the planning of the working days established itself in the meantime around the holidays, however, given by law exactly us the coming year little such days.
Also in the EU and in America one means something different by"holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days.
Work-Free Days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays, or are related with significant historical events.
We celebrate for example also New Year: Both the last day of the old one, as also the first day of the new year work-free days are - latter alone to be able to rest already with that the New Year's Eve revelers.
In the whole year we have in total fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th March to remind of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd October, the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20th August the state foundation is celebrated on 1st May the work, at the 1st and 2nd November we commemorate our dead woman.
In addition there are each two holidays to Easters, Whitsun, andChristmas.
There ours State-, National- or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "working day shift" persisted in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day.
The price of the prolonged weekends is, however, that we very presumably work on the Saturdays in front of that, or must go into the school.
When this day, that before or after the holiday falls, final is supposed to be worked off, is defined since long years by the work minister in an own regulation.
The right regulation is valid for all work donor and taker, for public employees and officials of the public service equally.
Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption is carried on, therefore also on the holidays.
The working regulations are only still brought to wage a little messily by the holidays at the end of the year: From the 24th December the life conks out in these parts ceremonially since most take time balancing, or the vacation especially picked up for that for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
In the next year more holidays fall into the week middle, and/or onto the end of the week so that there will be less rescheduling at the working days than this year.
The calendar is put first on the head around the day of the work so that the people can remain four days now at the piece at home.
Saturday, the 26th April becomes a working day, in this way the Friday, 2nd May a rest day can be.
The second rescheduling is associated with the holiday on 23rd October: On Saturday, which 18th October becomes one the Friday, to have to work off 24th October first of all.
The end of the year will completely stand, however, in the sign of the holidays after from the 24th December it remains to lie everything and to stand even if New Year's Eve fells on a Wednesday.
Six quenching trifles, in order to annoy colleagues
E-mails which we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that do not strike us anymore at all: You bring "color" into the everyday life at the job.
The question whether one becomes accustomed to these small inconveniences is bare or one is confronted better with the challenge and attempts these misleading, for other annoyed situations consciously too vermweiden.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that somebody of the marketing department called - a colleague says".
That one missed a meeting through that?
At best one regrets it and attempts to make up again when maybe one phones the marketing department and confesses remorsefully one would have forgotten, to achieve the information (that is that one little usual method).
Mostly the thing with an excuse is laughed away.
Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one can truly prepare unpleasant moments for his colleagues and attempt to avoid these situations consciously.
A little borrowed, which does not belong to one even?
There is not hardly a little Pithier than if one grasps a document, office accessories, or the telephone nevertheless it is not there.
Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today earlyaway?
Or that one is lost believed ball-point pens discovered for instance on the desk of a colleague?
Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed that something disappeared if they find.
Therefore, no envelopes or Post-its from the office put into the bag, because it could affect one even: no one more there, if nevertheless man's needs urgently.
Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues?
There is not any effective means to stop a gossip which already was started.
Who with whom, done something?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or supposition) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible to everyone to the nose!
And if nevertheless somebody opens for himself and his innermost secret betrays us, we should not misuse this confidence!
Best one keeps quiet as a grave, instead of that just not person presents to adjust even if other know also answer about the problems of the colleague.
Without reason in a sick way announced?
If one calls in the office in order to answer under appointment on tormenting headaches in a sick way because one just feels uneasy, or only simply liked to take a rest, one should realize one thing: The own work, unaufschiebbare Erledigungen, the colleagues must finish projects with fixed appointments now instead of one even.
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!
If one knows already on day before that one will not get it into the office on the next day, or that something could get in the way, for which one must stay at home, one should announce it in time, in this way neither the colleagues, to be confronted still the head unexpectedly with the absence.
Gesumme, giggle, making a call
One is hollow just in his work, is disturbed, however, suddenly from the loud giggle of the colleagues?
Overheard unintentionally a telephone conversation, which one should not have heard better?
One should say the colleagues not with sums, singing, conversations (that one leads over their heads), trample, permanent chiding or moaning irritate.
That all can be very much bothering also if they are not hollow just in a task (to write people organize people plan).
Are always the other ones guilty?
A project is not period of time-raked ready, one has an important letter or forgotten important Nachrichte to send, one should not search the fault of the own forgetfulness at other!
As far as possible one should not talk out onto the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best one admits his errors, and apologizes if other were affected also by that!
The question how one can make up for the error again, or make up for the missed thing is only far too made!
In the office - a feeling as at home?
Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen: Force for at home, nothing lost, however, in the office!
Not even then one should dress so leger if the job approved it actually!
Only not to become too slovenly - one should both his colleagues, than also themselves even so far respect, that one dresses in according to the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
It all rakes want to do - or as one becomes uninteresting forother
Stop and go-Verkehr, the car right in the allmorgendlichenjam.
From the radio a strange melody rings out: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume more highly.
The speed changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a feminine choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which rings out onmr2.
The domestic music scene did just not spoil us long time with qualitative Electropop.
However, now one sees even the jam different if one hears the new album of Zagar in this case.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so manch new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture, and self when the garage skirt with his Gitarrengequitsche is again "in" the domestic Electropop proves: There is new one under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, played music even in the band Yonderboi, before it - maybe, because an inn takes none two piper - his own way to walk along began.
It created the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music that melts elements together from jazz, Electronic, and pop, however, first than one with the request, to compose the soundtrack for a film, onto it had confronted (e.g..
"Szezon" of Ferenc Töroek).
The formation that at the beginning had performed in smaller clubs became known to the wider public first, as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 domestic nightmares followed and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the almost only one chose, also in the west marketable trendsetter.
Without a doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", it did not interest, however, any whether they bear this brand also with pleasure.
The band reacted, as it should: With a new, even better album.
The now appeared new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could reveal them new ways, however, already the title expresses the wish with the Pécser years according to continuity.
The expression originates indeed from the time, when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to fall, however, next to the ethereal character of the music the - corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends - louder guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll on.
With these songs the singer Gyoergy Ligeti living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle" introduced himself during the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song of the album created it even for the radio hit - that as of quite recently of early set to mr2 Petfi sending pop music late to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love" that was recorded by six domestic singers ("Underground Divas") under collaboration successively the earwig.
Everything all right therefore (?).
The hvg.hu asked with Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music of a certain shift keep on being reserved?
Balázs Zságer: The concept "shift music" doesnot intimate just much to me.
In my opinion there are two castes in the pop music, and indeed not main stream and underground, or Alternativ and pop, but Kommerziell and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground-music can be shallow and meaningless, just the same they can also be produced, however, only for the sale which turns it into commercial music.
Also a good pop-number can arise from an honest motive.
The acceptance of the listener functions also according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the frankness of the Hungarian one and the foreign public opposite your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, in particular west of us the pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only teenagers or Twens onto concerts, but also the older public go.
You pursue the trends in the pop music that pass around them around, much more attentive, because they hold it also for a part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: Which role is attributed to the public during yourwork?
It is important, who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: A good feeling to see is natural it that to come to our concerts more and more.
We have never composed, however, for the market.
With us the music does not arise in order to be used for a purpose but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is perceptible mostly at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is that one in turn only in the unreachable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless one struck me: You want to make it all right, you are not more interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example fromYonderboi?
It is as a soloist on the way and ratherestablished his career in the west.
B. Zs.: We do not go in fact his way, once from that very foreseen that one attempts again and again to interpret this in into our music.
We rather see ourselves than Teamplayer who trust in the musical presence of the other one and they make themselves unfold.
At the beginning comparisons of our work with that one were of course inevitable from Yonderboi since several of us come from his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petfi "Wings of Love"stands at first place.
Many heard the name Zagar first in connection with thisnumber.
Was the opening with an a little more popular style in the direction consciously of a wider public produced?
B. Zs.: We did not have any plans to write a hit which then is supposed to serve as a train horse for the album.
In this song it is a question of more.
It was considered as a final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just they, what the leading-principle was?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to do a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea to put together the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene came.
So the six-headed choir arose - therefore Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, that we christened to apäter "Underground Divas" then.
hvg.hu: You wanted to have the song just the same, or did the girls co-design it?
B. Zs.: There was the number already longer in the instrumental version, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number still needs something.
The piecework sequence demanded ceremonially according to asong voice.
I sang the melody still in the same night, later the girls learned it.
It everything came virtually immediately and frightening spontaneous.
I can remember, I was then quite electrified, but one already needed also the "divas".
With my voice alone the song would never have become sostrong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate, when also during the concert one had, however, the impression the girls would be in the background.
There is not any solo part (foreseen from the short solo from Judy Jay), they do not have any own role, they completely sing together and they are not louder, as the music, therefore their song is not only accompanied from the music.
Also on the stage they stood behind.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: That they stood behind was like this because ofproblems technical in that.
However we wanted to them consciously not to made any soloroles be attributed.
In the number it is a question also of one being supposed to forget his ego a little bit, forgotten, who from where come and where it is on the way, we let in simply too, that us lift these certain wings, the wings of the love.
I would have with pleasure, that also other sense this euphoric state that we sensed than the song arose.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most extensive song?
B. Zs.: During the musical work work of no actually at all, there were rather while mixing more difficult tasks.
For example with "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or with "rock'n'roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove did not want to function longer, nevertheless little by little everything turned out, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which one is your darling number of the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes with the concerts constantly and also now, where I have the album "losgelasssen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked because of inferiority feelings billions
Bottomless swindler
So the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerní banka, describes his former Done Jerome Kerviel.
She lost indeed almost five billion euros because of it.
It does not seem, however, rather so that Kerviel was only a tall player that wanted to do it like his colleagues in addition surely incapable was.
For the difference to all big bank houses he recognized the crisis in time at the amerikanischenn mortgage market.
"It is psychologically rather weak", was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors that announced it near the police.
It a human being who had achieved profits at the end of last year with his businesses at the level of 1,6 billion euros was how, however, Kerviels which the French media, for example the daily paper Le Monde, published follows from the statements.
Crisis not only in America
"All which I wanted money was to be earned for my bank", he says in his statement.
In the summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion of euros just from the American crisis.
He had already indeed at the year beginning spotted the occasion forthis purpose.
In February there was already first news about so-called sub-prime-mortgages as they are given to income-weak customers or such which already formerly had installment problems turning out in trouble.
This crisis should not have influence on the whole economy, however.
Kerviel did not believe that and was right.
At the end of the year it had screwed his profit highlyup to 1,6 billion euros.
"Already than I the first half billion had earned, I did not know, as I that should not declare", Kerviel adds and passes on that it did not keep anything definitively for itself.
During the whole interrogation he admits that he forged documents so that one would not come him to the pulps.
He succeeded even in leading his heads behind the light even if the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his businesses by degrees.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
Presumably hardly.
"I thought, that they the simple fact, that I have earned for the bank 1,6 billion, satisfies."
From where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to acquire his position in a step by step way.
It came into the Société Générale in the year 2000, immediately after it had ended his study at the Lyons university, one.
His annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became selfcontinuous broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless he knew that he will never earn as much as other ones.
"Already at my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one observed me.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel declared the investigator.
But already soon to his entry the first great success came.
With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot in his putting half a billion of euros on course losses of this title with the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
Solang du Gewinn make, we let to you
"That is as a snowball", he said to the policemen.
But the heads supposedly out of everything knew,and/or foresaw it.
"As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes."
However, then the great stroke came at the beginning this year.
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in the middle of January wanted to balance it that.
When he came to the work on Monday, he was already not anymoreemployees' of the bank.
And a few days later the bank announced that she lost five billion euros because of it.
And as came they it onto the pulps?
It looked suspicious through a vacation.
"I took only four days of the previous year.
A broker who does not take any vacation is one who does not want one to look to him into the cards", Kerviel said definitively.
Tschechien has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday in total nine development programs through which the Czech Republic can come to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the next years.
It is a question approximately here of half of the sum which Tschechien can receive in the years 2007 to 2013 anyway from Brussels.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regionaldevelopment programs.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns assignedly from the program "Doing and innovation".
Most the most money, about 150 billion, will flow into the trafficexpansion.
The traffic program is the biggest development program and covers up to 22 percent of the means which Tschechien can receive from the fund.
This money increases correspondingly the budget of the State traffic infrastructure ground which will be in charge of 90,8 billion next year.
The program "Doing and innovation" is supposed to serve entrepreneurs and companies to winning resources to innovative enterprises.
The companies are supposed to gain finances through that for the introduction of new technologies, for operations research, however, also for the introduction of more effective organization methods.
With the previous Geld-Aquisition from EU-grounds Tschechien belongs among the new entry countries to the up to now least successful.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty year long prison sentence for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty year long prison sentence for the former president Arnold Alemán to whom he had been condemned in 2003 because of finance fraud at the level of 100 million dollars (almost 1,8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he had been released from the prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state finds out grating again is currently unclear according to the AP news agency.
According to the chairperson of the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend now on the custody officials whether one makes Alemán sit out his punishment at home or whether it into the prison must.
A court proved that Alemán had moved money of the government regularly onto accounts of foreign companies in Panama four years ago.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to his relatives and narrowest supporters.
Some of this money landed finally in a fund that Alemán for the financing of his election campaign 2001 had established.
Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved of.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government projected, and which was accepted without support of the opposition through the coalition majority.
The for the current year the SSD (Social democrats) was still approved of with support because minister Sobotka had presented it (of this party), and the SSD could not allow it therefore to refuse it.
Unlike the lively debate in front of the vote about the motion of no confindence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliament approved of this traditionally few paid attention to, nevertheless highly important law calmly.
That is in a way paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes that or not.
The budget is an essential component of the politics, is concealed, however, by the power fight of the government and the opposition.
That is a more thankful topic for the media, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it.
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers are.
The national budgets suffered from three weak points that the budget can not remove for the year 2008 at the same time near the last social-democratic governments:
The first is the high part of editions, that are of because of law obliging, at which it is not a question only of the pensions, but also around social expenditures which the "silent" coalition of SSD and KSM (Communists) in the last year in front of the choices decided on.
The second is the defizitäre budget policy as a consequence of the first weak point.
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, that is the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermassen under control.
A true time bomb is, however, the budget deficit of themunicipalities.
Many mayors often distributed debentures through which their city halls caused it in the excess in order to develop further sources from taxes, deliveries and bank loans except for gains for investments without careful consideration.
In the last years they succeeded in it, these debts through massive sale of stocks the Energy- and other supply networks' that they had received in the course of the denationalization of the state pay off.
Now this source already versiegt.
As far as we stick only to official and nachprüfbare facts, we find, that:
our economy already since some years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase which the SSD incessantly boasts about ran through.
That represented a unique possibility for their governments to sort out the public finances.
Instead of this these governments got into debt the state, however,still more.
Other countries, foreseen from a few exceptions as Hungarians, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more reasonable than our republic.
That is a giant disgrace which is mainly to be ascribed to the former governments.
We belong to the countries which are threatened, seen, least from poverty in the global standard.
Therefore no nassiven social programs which were blown up unfortunately just in the last years very superfluously in gigantic scale are necessary.
Even if has succeeded in deleting a part of the senseless populistischen editions that were adopted this year in front of the choices, is clear, that if it does not come in next time for a shift of the pension entry age and for a pension reform, then virtually any politics in this country, and, very now who is at the power ends, he will not have anything as a pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated if one says that officials that divide up the biggest part of the tax yields mechanically on pensions and social expenditures become then from ruling politicians.
Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but it can stop only the displacement of normal editions through duty editions.
That for 2008 designated deficit of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous, if former governments had not distributed in the last ten years, which only worked.
If we do not want pure administration officials to become from ruling politicians that in fact it results in that, we must be patient then and this coalition government not far too strong, that it is conscious of that that the state can issue only as much as it is to charm in the situation at taxes and fees rest during the preparation of further reform laws want.
Only these facilitate a step-by-step enforcement of a harmonious national budget.

Banks want to overcome crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided on fighting against the crisis together on the financial markets.
So more than 100 billion dollars will reach by means of auctions onto the currency markets.
On these auctions the banks interest rates auction, to which they are ready to lend money mutually.
For example the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, wider she forks out 24 for the European one and the Swiss central bank.
It is after the assaults of the 11.September the first time that the central banks of the single states agree on a so coordinated procedure to the defense and/or Abmilderung of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is supposed to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, therefore" Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote "the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend" in a report for his customers.
"The probability of a recession reduced the coordinated action of the central banks in the USA of 65 % on about 50 %", Baumohl added in his report.
The banks lost because of not operated credits already around 60 billion dollars, particularly in the United States.
Analysts expect even further billion losses.
"This central banks must have been afraid of what still everything can follow when decided on this procedure real" the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, said.
"It looks like this that the situation is in fact bad" he passed on.
The central banks have the apprehension that if the banks themselves have access to loans heavily, to become also more expensive for their customers credits.
That would reduce the consumption and to fling the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth on the whole world.
The central banks decided to that after their not having succeeded in it on lowering the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate that is used with the money rental company between banks.
That means that the banks were afraid continuously to lend money mutually, and that although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the fall had lowered their interest rates repeatedly.
"That will have the same effect as a further drawdown of the interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of tense said to consulting of the agency of Reuters.
Some analysts think that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem and indeed the case of the property market in the USA.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unplausible
Global climate changes damage supposedly developing countries most themost.
President Václav Klaus commented again on the problems of the global warming.
The criticism referred now to Bali onto the zu Ende gehende international conference of the UNO for the climate change.
In Vienna, where it presented his book "one bluer, no green planet", he exported that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible.
According to Klaus only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations is not inacceptable but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that she accompanies, and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is some word fireworks that is only substitute for a real solution of current problems" said Klaus.
The Czech president stressed during the idea of his book that his topic is very important for it, and that he commits itself to that so therefore.
He expressed also his contentment with his book being published in German translation because "I often stumble on caricatures of my opinions."
Now prospective customers could gather hisattitude in a therefore undistorted way.
Klaus reminded of his not being a Klimatologe, but he has in his opinion sufficient conditions in order to write such a book.
It is finally to understand academics, capable, professional treatises and to judge, has experience with statistics and is also to nation business person.
He referred to the thesis as a main statement of the book, that the climate is changed continuously and that his changes are therefore normal, that there is not any matching opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not far too great and serious and thus did not represent any threat for the earth warming, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffectively and in an inacceptable way are extensive.
In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen, for unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on other ones, he regards that as a dangerous restriction of the freedom.
On questions of person presents he declared repeats, he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, however against militant eco-activists that do not take any regard onto the relation between expenditure and profit."
Klaus had already two months ago in the Hayek-institute talked about the same topic in Vienna.
600000 people did not succeed in changing their driver'slicense
600000 motorists missed the period of time in order to change their old driver's license that validity end of the year ends.
Today the last day is where one can apply for the exchange so that the authorities create it to to exhibit a new driver's license at the end of the year.
The ministry, however, does not fear that after New Year hunderttausende drivers without valid going-authorization go onto the streets.
According to the authorities those ones that do not want to drive more at all did mainly not change their driver's license.
While small places are announcing a strong drop of the interest in the Füherscheinumtausch, the offices of the capital are overwhelmed with requests, and the interest in the exchange still increased this week.
The municipal administration dispatches daily about 2000 customers.
One must queue up approximately half an hour.
In Prague approx. 140000 motorists did not change theirdriver's license yet.
The exhibition one new driver's license's lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of time of five days.
In This Case the driver must dazuzahlen, however, 500 crowns.
A fine threatens motorists who do not get the stipulated exchange up to the end of the year and set off without valid driver's license from January.
The evil culprit pays at the most 2000 crowns.
The police also keep it up, however, with the infringement an admonition bewenden let.
In the case of an infringement the punishment can increaseto 2500 crowns.
According to former information also that one of the municipality can get a punishment imposes, that does not go at all.
It can, so it meant to threaten a punishment ofeven 30000 crowns.
The ministry appealed to the offices already for making exercise gentleness and imposing at most a punishment of 1000 crowns.
According to the speaker of the traffic ministry, Karel Hanzelka, does not threaten, however, anybody one a thousand crown punishment.
The driver's license is a document at which everyone can decide whether he wants to own it or not.
It is not a question of an identity card, that everyone must have, and a valid indeed.
People who do not want to go anymore should give their driver'slicense.
It suffices bringing it to the responsible municipality office or sending it there by certified letters.
At the end of the year driver's licenses which were exhibited in between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
The motorists must change, however, also further kinds of driver's licenses by degrees.
People with driver's licenses from the years 1994 to 2000 have another three years of time for the exchange.
The validity of driver's licenses that 2001 to 2004 were switched off ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is a question in this case of about 2,6million further driver's licenses.
Court lowers punishments for detectives thatwere allied with Berdych
The former policeman Josef Opava and thing, common to Petr Koaík, who is accused, with the gang of David Berdych, have done, received 13 and/or 10 years of custody.
The Prager upland court decided on that in a legal judgment, that in this case their punishment about one and/or reduced about two years.
Originally 14 and/or 12 years threatened the detectives of the "office for the fight against the organized committing".
Against the present judgment there is not any appointment possibility, only revision near the Uppermost Court is possible.
Berdych itself is indeed also accused in this thing, nevertheless the erstinstanzliche judgment awaits him first of all.
In the case of other processes he had already received, however, punishments of in total 16 years.
He can not be condemned to more.
A district court spoke in January 19 persons particularly because of participation in holdups guiltily, the upland court discussed today the appointment of 16 of them.
Most accused persons denied from the beginning the accusation with the reason it is a question of a constructed case.
According to the means-Bohemian district court members of the police handed over to criminals information among other things in agreement with Berdych from sources of the police, different holdups covered and helped members of the bands with escaping from the prosecution.
The gang left 30 percent of the booty for that with Opava andKoaík.
With the accusation it is a question of crimes ofthe bands from the years 1999 to 2001.
In particular around holdups whose victims suffered often hard injuries, but also around usurpation and unauthorized arm possession.
In the case of house searches the police discovered illegal indeed pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser sight telescope and a submachine gun.
The gang enriched itself according to the accusation through their holdups around many millions of crowns.
Except for beihnahe 20 men in this procedure courts Berdych and a series of other because of further holdups recognized legal as guilty.
Further men from Berdychs vicinity must account in another process, further cases did not reach to the court yet.
Tomás Pta and Maros Šulej, that is in Irish custody and waits for the final decision on their delivery for the purpose of prosecution in the Czech Republic, escaped the main negotiations up to now.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a delivery clinic the attorney of the harmed parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns of compensation from the hospital in Tebí plus court costs.
For each of the mothers per three million, for the fathers per two million and for the children per a million.
The hospital offers at the most 200000 for every parent pair.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondej Dostál, does absolutely not agree therefore agreed with the proposal Velebas.
"We refuse such a proposal, it is too high around a multiple", Dostál said after the present negotiations.
"In order to be able to form ourselves an opinion on this counterproposal, however, we need the expert opinion, which the opposite side made create.
We will find out whether actually it has statement value.
We insist, however, on the opinion, that that for all should lie together in the a hundred thousand heir-rich", emphatical Dostál.
The amount should move it according to between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning the family wanted a million crowns from Jabloov for every month which she their biological daughter had not pulled up.
For Veleba an expert opinion that for it the university hospital had elaborated in Prague Motol served as a basis for compensation negotiations.
The parents of the children suffered psychological damages and stress symptoms in different strength and depth in the view of specialists from the field of psychology and psychiatry.
The men took the stress-situation better even if they saw themselves opposite reproaches, they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women manage in turn the after-effects of the experienced trauma worse, as well as Veleba summarized the contents also with what now just ends.
Nurses of the delivery clinic exchanged Veronika and Nikola on 9th December of last year in Tebí.
Last week the children to their biological parents returned - Nikola to the ermáks in Pibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro and Jaroslava Trojanová according to Jabloov.
The district captain of the Vysoina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over at the end of October 100000 crowns to every family as substitute for editions which had arisen for them through the error of the hospital in Tebí which subjects to the district.
All hospitals in Tschechien are of liability-insured because oflaw.
In case of doubt they must reach for a reserve fund, only by way of exception they can apply at the Sluggish Help.
The courts granted custody of concerned person up to now comparably low compensation sums, the amounts were determined through tables and they moved in the field from a hundred dew sending, by way of exception of millions.
Polívka came round his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel around the brand"Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava he used indeed when first the denomination "Walachischer König", however a team had established the project in long-standing work around Tomás Harabis in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not participate today in the negotiations.
According to his attorney the thing in this way is probably not, however, ended and his mandator will presumably appeal.
"The quarrel goes around Mr Harabis and his team wanting to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitically", attorney said after the negotiations Polívkas.
All put "kingdom" straight with the words "Of Walachisches" this actor and comedian in front of.
The same opinion also Harabis is.
"We have an almost ten year long work behind us.
Fund-raising and drafts of the activities", he said.
According to it the reason is quarrel aroundmoney.
"After years it struck them that the project is successful and that they could have also something of that.
You" want "to gain" our work "parasitically, he passed on.
Lucrative business
According to the court Polívka used the denomination "Walachischer König" for the first time in one of his telecasts.
In 1993 the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
That was not associated, however, then with the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later Harabis came to the thought of distributing walachische passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity to which Harabis connected the foundation of the company then "Walachisches kingdom" formed out an originally funny action.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and offered their owners even reductions during the visit of his farm and his theater ideas.
Who will be on the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabis used only the bare idea which made public Polívka in the program "circus ring" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity Polívkas surely helped the project of the walachischen kingdom", the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project Harabis that would have dedicated to it intensely and his team are.
The cooperation of the today zerstrittenen parties lasted up to the year 2000, when Harabis organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, began themselves to accumulate the quarrels that culminated in the deduction "König Boleslavs I. chosenly up to the Sankt Nimmerleins day" between Polívka and Harabis.

The competition prepared by Harabis could bring clearness in the quarrel around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should follow from that.
It did not want to betray details and anappointment yet.
"We do not want to rush anything.
It should be something like that as the royal move inWalachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Also Mr Polívka can "enroll" himself at that quietly",Harabis added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Voruteile fade away
To say around the truth I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His going-properties were not a lot worth, one could refer to the quality of the gear-change, the guidance and also the processing as rather lower-average.
However, now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that one is better around many things.
The station wagon with the SW denomination is another piece wider, and revising my opinion only remains to me.
When I of the classical Hatchback of the 207 had tested, I had to complain for example about the too small head freedom on the rear seats.
There are not these complaints now anymore, because the bodywork of the station wagon is so formed that not even two meter men will suffer.
Quickly wider
I go through the interior trim only shortly in order not to repeat myself too very much.
It is a question of a quite succeeded design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where otherwise the car does a so elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past the times are where we complained about too short seats or headrests possibly.
Also the side hold improved to that considerably oppositeitself in 206.
What affects the room offer, one can sense also here the increased measurements of the bodywork.
In the station wagon also the already mentioned lack of head freedom isremoved.
Suitcase into the trunk
The main thing at this car is, however, the loadingspace|hold|payload bay.
I must designate that one (also because of the drop-down moving-window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with safety belts which represent an ideal compromise.
You do not disturb, make yourself be separated and hold also more difficult objects.
But let's talk about the case volume.
It is according to table in the basic version 428 liters, which is a rather average value in the comparison for the competition.
However not in the comparison to the vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi, meistverkauften in Tschechien.
If we compare to the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find, that the Peugeot remains around clearly perceptible 52 liters.
For a foreign vacation or while inviting a pram this value is already critical.
But in order to emphasize the Positiva, I must mention still the loading space very flat after the turnover of the back seats or also the very low sill.
120 hp in four row
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with stroke volume 1,6 liters and an achievement of 88 kilowatts.
And a 1600-cube-engine which stimulates a Familien-Hatchback should look honestly said, so.
It is quiet, has a small consumption and migrateswell.
If I compare it with his counterpart at Škoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust with a cloth would have been blocked, I can be then only inspired by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is just not popular.
We must remember, however, our having tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine at the level of 329900 crowns still starts.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns what already quite a lot is.
The equipment Premium of the test car is noticeable once again with 80000 crowns besides.
We had, however, head air bags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic windshield wiper triggering, electrical window lifters behind and and...
So the car costs in total 531900 crowns settles.
That is an amount, however you add up the options of a Fabia once and you will arrive with a very similar sum.
Therefore only still the decision which brand one wantsto choose remains.

At British schools the number of children increases from countries of Eastern Europe, which causes fears at the local ones around the further development of the local school being.
The integration of the East Europeans pushes up to now obstacles onto arow.
British schools find even cases, where quarrels increase between the immigrants and the children of the initial inhabitants at violence.
The case of North Kent, where the quarrels are increased between the locals and Slowakian immigrants by degrees, illustrates the problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at britschen schools aptly.
Quarrels, harassment and fights among pupils transferred onto the relationships between the parents.
The situation developed already so far that the police arrested a Slowakian woman who had beaten a decennial boy with an iron rod in Chatham.
The accused person defended herself with the boy offending it with racist insults.
The police had to intervene also after an attack of two minor girls on a Slowakian immigrant.
The girls had supposedly done racist remarks opposite the man and thrown stones at it.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up a bus cottage and spat onto us.
When I said to him it is supposed to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and bared his buttocks then", a mother of Slowakian pupils of the newspaper The Times described a further unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both pages.
One of the locals referred to the quarrel with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as a survival fight.
The mentioned cases testify, that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants at British schools is strained always.
In Great Britain are announced to 70000 Slovaks that came to job hunting here.
About 30000 Slowakian pupils attend accordingly British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is in fact an island of the freedom.
What you always expect of your vacation, that will be fulfilled if you select only the correct thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond.
Including palms and space with waiters that offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails at the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulettes.
On the islands of the Caribbean you find that in overabundant measure.
Only on an island you find, however, still many more, and Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Big Antilles, is this island.
In the Spaniards' times Cuba of those ones was bastion for the conquestof Americas.
Kolumbus mentioned it the most beautiful place which ever a human eye saw.
Havana became once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures which had stolen the Spaniards in America and transported the Spaniards to Europe then.
And then the American epoch came.
The hotel Nacional completely arose at the end of the 20th century.
One of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, made him be uplifted, because all that was regarded as a crime in the USA (especially during the prohibition) became on Cuba most welcome and supplementary - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among other things.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Into Havana high-rise buildings increased, over the wide boulevards cars that numbered among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last Jahrhundets drove.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lie.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio stars of the show business and politicians from whole America left behind their signatures.
And today?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana also you can leave behind your autograph.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional one mixes cocktails very asrequired for you.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and moist air fell apart a long time ago.
Havana, in particular his oldest part, likes to have come down strongly, nowhere one does not find as many wonderful colonial sights here in the vicinity as just.
Other places are just herausgeputzt, for the example Trinidad.
In regard on the tourism bringing urgently needed money there was for this development green light.
In the last fifteen years new hotels did not arise only in Havana, but also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on islets as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other.
Cuba offers another whim which is unique on the world and attracts particularly railroad lovers.
Steam and diesel-practiced narrow gauge railways brought the sugar cane of remote plantations to the sugar works.
Your vehicle fleet was not renewed over decades, and one sees like this there locomotives droll and functioning fully whose contemporaries stand somewhere else in the museum for a long time.
Places of excursions
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not let out thebedeutendendsten places.
So one does not have to write about Varadero or Havana morefully.
It remains only to mention that there is a museum whose visit that one that likes this writer should not be able to escape in the already mentioned estate Hemingways.
The Viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the mostpicturesque angles of Cuba.
The opulent vegetation grows onto lime ground.
The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply from the valley, in their cavities fertile ground through which also weather-beaten rock fields of thick vegetation are overcast was collected.
It is this valley where the maybe best Cuban tobacco is built on.
In his final form you can stumble on it if you go to one of the cigar factories of Havana.
Possibly it seems to some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV series "Major Zeman" was turned there.
Trinidad
An ancient city which was set up shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
The trade with slave and sugar brought her fame andfortune.
The fortune embodied itself in the neat beauty of the smallcity.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French colonizers, has hardly changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, sited between the sea and the Escambray-mountains, is a so remote place that there was not over there any street that would have connected the area with the remaining country yet in the fifties of the last century.
This isolation contributed to its remaining unseen.
Nothing was built there, not torn down, however, therefore also anything, it was glad to everyone that he had a roof above the head.
If one has more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth to look at interesting places in the surroundings as about the beach playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar works".
At the evening one should go into the Casa de la Música that livens up according to the darkness then and where the music is not silent up to the morning.
Baracoa
Completely to describe this small town in the east of Cuba some as the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this opinion is influenced also by the way there.
Both streets which lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run through a landscape which is hardly affected from human interventions.
UNESCO received this eastern outpost of Cuba thanks to the nonlocal unchanged nature into their world heir list.
There the best chocolate is manufactured, in the church one shows the cross of Kolumbus (in reality it arose about a hundred years after the journeys of Kolumbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, stands, several mesas from which El Yunque is the best known are to be seen.
Over the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Mästra mountains, the pig bay and the island Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion which the descendants of slaves stand up for, over all that could write one many pages.
However, as one says so: Looking better with own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
To few soldiers and the mangle at necessary outfit influences according to the United States the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should project a concrete plan according to the words of defense minister Robert Gates for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not proceed after their ideas, about that the representatives of the countries who stationed units in the south of the country agreed agreed to themselves in the Scotch Edinburgh.
Next to the wachsenden resistance on the part of the Taliban the eight participating states discuss also about further coordination plans among the allies.
During the United States through their Verteigungsminister Robert Gates the NATO units too more activity called, Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the development aid.
"In Afghanistan a Vorwärtsentwicklung is perceptible, but military power can be only a part of the solution.
A further part consists in making to begin even a development of the economy and security for the inhabitants possible", the British Verteigungsminister of The Browne of the BBC says.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached according to information of the American army the highest state since five years.
The number of power actions climbed, in the southern province Helmand, in the comparison to the previous year around 27 percent even around sixty percent.
The NATO countries stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of that about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States the allies bumped, however, into an absolute border, which affects organization and outfit of the units.
Actually they claim further helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the next time and about the kind and way in which we can reach it", Gates said.
Similarly the secretary-general of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, wasexpressed today.
"I am not delighted over what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air availably.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and outfit which we would need, and that is too little", De Hoop of the agency of Reuters said with regard to the end of three day long conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There is also quarrel among the shared countries in the last months over whether all allies give their best in Afghanistan.
Because of passivity for example Germany wascriticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerously represented in Afghanistan.
You are stationed in fields where there is only a minimum of power and the combat requirements are not as high for them as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, however," Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" called this week the German soldiers lazybones.
"Afghan sluggards enttarnt: The Germans do games while our Jungs" are "fighting", the "Sun" wrote in a contribution, that through photos of German soldiers was complemented, that play table tennis.
The German picture newspaper proceeded with the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby-competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debts will shoot up in the year 2009 onto atrillion
A national debt of 84000 crowns is allotted to everyCzech.
The total fault increased until end of September to842,7 billion crowns.
The government had intended to get into debt this year with 159,2 billion cones.
At the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan, however, thanks to the better development of the state beating hold politics on 152,8 billion.
The National Debts of the Czech Republic increased until end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
Within the first nine months of this year they climbed accordingly around 40,2 billion.
Since June they sank, however, around 13,4 billion.
The Exchequer confirmed his information over the national debts of beginning of October with that.
A fault of 84000 crowns is allotted to every Czech.
Over the entire last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.
"Until now it shines, that we will not cross the border of a trillion crowns possibly thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year before in the year 2009.
Next year the debts should "move" between 900 billion and a trillion crowns", David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz, said.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, sees it similar: "We could come to the transgression of a trillion in the course of the year 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation is changed on the political stage, and should be ready more save, that could last up to the year 2010.
But I do not take such a change as a basis", he noticed.
Debts increase
The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes particularly from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget.
The national debt is financed through treasury bills, state debentures, direct loans or for example through loans of the European Investment Bank.
The domestic state indebtedness increased this year to 719,4 billion crowns in the meantime.
The foreign liabilities of the state increased in the meantime to 123,3 billion around 1,7 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable national debt reached at the end of September 803,3 billion crowns and sank since June around 13,7 billion.
The average maturity of the national debts|publicdebts climbed 6,5 years.
"The total fault increased over the year up to the third quarter from the first around 13 percent, which in fact is a lot faced with that how things go for the economy well.
It is interesting that the growth particularly with the debentures, where the increase is 20 percent, is to be noted.
Pikora commented, "it is bad that the debts increase, but on the other hand this already shows that one can undertake something before the pension reform comes", the data.
Better than expected
It follows from the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 that the government had intended for this year to incorporate 159,2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan, however, thanks to the better development of the state beating hold politics on 152,8 billion crowns.
This amount stems particularly from the state budget deficit that will reach 76 billion crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion.
It keeps on being a question of maximally planned means for the consolidation agency at the level of 13,3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of the pensions, the financing of state debentures for 43 billion and around rates for the loans near the European Investment Bank at the level of 1,8 billion.
For that, that they has given a teddy bear a name, it was demonstrated today to a court in Khartum.
According to specification of their attorney the British teacher that had been accused of insult of the Islam in Sudan on Thursday evening was condemned to 15 days of custody and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartum.
The Briton was accused, allowed to pupils six to seven year old to have, a teddy bear to give the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils had complained repeatedly near the Sudanese Ministry of Education, the 54-year old elementary-school teacher who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was picked up on Sunday with themselves at home and accused to article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the insult of the Islam.
In fact this matter takes their beginning in September when the teacher asks their pupils six to seven year old to select a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, told to Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, under that headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally when the class votes 20 of 23 children of Mohammed choose as a dearest first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, however particularly also a first name very frequent in Sudan.
Then the children constructed a book for the class, with which photo of the bear on that and the caption is My Name Mohammed.
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult of the Islam is very simple.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian gibbon's that teaches Sudan at the same school, declared, he knows it well, and she would never have something would have done, with which it could kick a religious belief too near, I only regret that them the children asked for voting for a name his opinion's acts it at that only around an innocent error.
An opinion that numerous pupils of the teacher divide that these as very attentive opposite their pupils and as a person, who never talks about religion in the class describe.
One considers, that the first name of Mohammed is simultaneously also the one in Great Britain at the second most frequent given second name, for which in the English 14 different spelling exists.
This first name often selected by Moslem families is regarded as a kind of respect at the prophets (it is given frequently to the first-born of a family).
But how loud the rules in the reference to the use of this first name?
One may give it for example a toy?
This is as a matter of course a question of the interpretation.
On Wednesday it did not come during the last negotiation meeting over the future status of the province in Vienna for any agreement.
At the end the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended Wednesday Morning one sixth and last discussion meeting in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future statuses of the separatistic province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not come to any agreement about the statuses, the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger declared at a press conference in Vienna.
With stress on the peace standing in the region on the game his American counterpart of Frank asked to Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina for this purpose, their obligations for the receipt of the peace to come later, to carry on and the conversations also about the end of the negotiations out.
No acts of violence are expected in immediate future, but we stand at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and pointed out that there are absolutely clear tensions.
End of the mediation on 10th December
The mediators of the troika that unites the European Union, the USA and Russia in themselves hit on Monday a last in Serbia and in Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by Speaking in an Albanian manner to 90 %, when Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko up to the 10th December submit their report with the UN Security Council, could become clearer.
The conversations of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation meeting since the troika last August of the UNO the task to a new mediation had kept.
Americans and Europeans reckon that their switching task will end on 10th December.
The Russians who had blocked already the approval of the independence of Kosovo with the Security Council insist on a continuation of the negotiations beyond this finishing date.
Russia was and intercessor of a negotiated solution, an agreed solution stays, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo stood for eight years under administration of the UNO, the western countries hold the independence for the single solution with future under supervision through the EU.
Pristina shows himself readily for announcing these on one side if the Security Council should not decide on their advantage too.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately no accord could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations of the last chance were led, announced.
Hashim Thaci, former chief of the kosovarischen rebellion and future prime ministers of the province divided his regret.
He added, however, that the plan suggested by Belgrade for the autonomy belongs to a past which led to murders and deportations.
Dominoes-effect
The Serbian president Boris Tradic thought for his part that a compromise is always to be striven for, and warned the Albanian majority against the consequences of a one-sided declaration of independence of the province from Kosovo.
Belgrade means, that it especially a "dominoes effect" in a region fürchet, that is weakened by the independence wars of the nineties still so very much.
For Serbia that does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday the Serbian delegation had insisted, that any decision only and only only and only in the Security Council is hit, where their Russian ally holds a right of veto.
The parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the rows of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, the Serbian prime minister Vojislav Kostunica declared.
These negotiations lasted two years.
You must end the way they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu answered to the journalists, that the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word concerning the status, and added the last word, that every one-sided declaration of independence will end on the part of the population speaking in an Albanian manner in vote with the western countries.

Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the International space station (EAT) will have needed more than seven hours in the space in order to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar thermal collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific works on the station.
A risky exit that achieved several records due to his duration, the distance of habitable modules, the quickness with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts in order to carry on the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a big cylindrical part that is supposed to include soon the European and Japanese scientific labs.
This module is a kind of pier for the module-labs.
But one must be able to supply it with stream.
It was the second task of the crew therefore to turn over a 17,5 tons heavy module for the electric power production above solar thermal collectors which was already on the ISS in order to bring it into his final position.
After she had moved it, the crew got down to the restructuring of the solar thermal collector of the module whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened, that one of the commutators that can be folded as accordions was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the commutator anymore yet.
The astronauts who leave the space shuttle Discovery originally for a control walk and then should repair other solar thermal collector whose rotation system was faulty saw themselves forced to dedicate oneself to the damaged commutator.
And Scott Parazynski was selected, to stroll around at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to that of the station in order to carry out the repair.
He is one of the best Spacewalker (Wetraumgänger) of theNASA.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-jaehirige learned doctor was selected therefore, to operate on the hurt solar thermal collector.
After he had examined the damages exactly, it cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of rails on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker to stay near the sluice, and, of inside, of the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The astronauts had devised the tool which he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which produce several hundreds of volts, on board the station and made the tool which he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which several hundreds of volts produce.
When the action was ended, Scott Parazynski waited, until the commutator was completely folded, before he counted his tools and before he turned his tools back into the station.
Yesterday afternoon enjoyed the astronauts half a day of relaxation, before seven astronauts turned round today onto the space shuttle Discovery back in order probably to enter upon the moving-flight to the earth Wednesday.

Currently EADS loses the Paris stock exchange 4 % on 21.96 euro.
The group was forced, their business predictions for 2007 still once purchase taking on the through the only to check development of the engine of the remains caused to A400M striding slowly that delays the old maid flight of the airplane.

The choice of the Status Quo
On Sunday it will not become with the counting of the urns thrilling: The mass of the Russians will decide for president of Putins party, United Russia.
After an election campaign very sealed off she confirms their aspiration to stability, yes even according to authoritarianism.
Three days in front of the parliament choices the Russian president Wladimir Putin addresses an information broadcast on the public senders to the voters that already indeed was recorded, that contents, however, are kept a secret.
He does this in his property as a top candidate of the United Russia, the pros-Kremlin-party for which an overwhelming victory announces itself.
Yesterday the president did not make anything look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and gab zufrieden with supplying a new target against the western powers, accused that of the interference werden- his darling topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest, extremely transparent and open choices, choices without trickery, he added.
From view of the opposition they vertan themselvesthere.
They prangert an election campaign stained throughsuppression.
The communist leader Günnadi Ziouganov does not say there would never have been such dirty choices even in the time of Eltsin.
According to the suppression of the demonstrations at the last weekend, is valid for ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorized demonstrating to five days of custody, according to his attorney furthermore visit prohibition had been condemned.
The Russians preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus
After these parliament choices without tension two a lot weiterführende questions raise themselves:
Who will enter upon Putins succession as a president?
The office newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first ballot of the premiership choices, the 2nd March 2008; the candidates familiarized oneself until the 23rd December time.
Since it was chosen in 2000 and chosen in 2004 again, Wladimir Putin can not line up for a third mandate in consequence.
And now no successor finds himself.
Which role will play Putin after March?
Prime minister?
Chairpersons' of the parliament majority and the omnipotent party United Russia, the government and president will select?
Whatever it will be, at the Parliament- or at the premiership choices, the previous power will triumph.
That is tradition.
The Russians preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus, they are not gentleman of their fate, the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada, thinks.
The Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St. Petersburg State University goes back even still further: The middle class society weiterentwickelt in this country which was christianized five centuries to Europe only very much slowly; the famous esprit de corps delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin picked up the model of a paternalistic state again, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more more, there on this new paternalism's no terror followed, but a certain economical prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie donation means.
Today the Russians renounce from free pieces the personal responsibility which they laid on the day according to the decay of the USSR on a short-term basis.
To which still long held over?
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
And the administration elite understands to hold the Status Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian region chairpersons) lead the local choice lists of the United Russia.
The freedoms new, coming from the west are often tantamount to chaos, as in the nineties.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense the Russians will not vote either for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year old professor: To which still long held over?
Those ones that are at the power are not so bad, why they pay off?
A difficult souvenir

Until recently still several states were, under that also Germany against making these name-related documents accessible to the public due to the particular character of certain information.
As for example the alleged homosexuality or the intellectual hindrance of some deportation victims.
The occupant listen of the concentration camps or the warrants of arrest exhibited by Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: To find civilians who had been deported or subordinated to the forced labor, and to provide them with a confirmation of their arrest possibly in order to smooth the way for their compensation for them so.
Still today more than 300 celebration employees work in bath Arolsen zehntausende personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a restricted interest in the access to bath Arolsen.
One must not expect anything basically New in these documents, Pr had. Declared to Wolfgang Benz, conductor of the research center for anti-semitism of the Technical Berlin University, in 2006.

Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if none smaller surrenders than the terminator on the other hand.
These attracting-attempts appertain to the delegatee tasks.
A politically "tricky mandate", because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces this "Runaway Productions".

Does an Endjahres-Rally await the stock exchange? Disagreement with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just five weeks up to the annual account at the stock exchange the investors abrade themselves already the hands with regard to the coming Endjahres-Rally.
Nevertheless the experts can not create any securepredictions concerning that.
Banif believes that in that statistically considers the month of December at the stock exchange usually with a positive market trend goes around
Nonetheless it is not advisable, predictions short-term and to construct only on the basis of statistics. Particularly then not, when serious tensions to be taken determine the current market event
Although other experts approve one such a strong course rise in the last weeks of the year not, nevertheless these say that the stock market price is designated by that one givenly liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest due to the lack secure common stock fund main in bond funds that is there to productive capital values strongly affected by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend.
Accordingly the stock exchange will rather show in opinion of these experts a course trend rather lateral, influenced from market fluctuations particularly because we can not estimate the scales of the possible drop of the interest rate of the US issuing bank yet, to take back an insecurity that one before all onto the climbed crude oil price and the danger of the rise of the inflation rate is.
Javier Barrio, chairperson of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees with it being a risky time to announce an imminent Markt-Rally.
The chances do not stand very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish share index Ibex already since his Höchstmarke on the 8th November of 15.945,7 points lost a value of 4 %.
But not all experts divide the same negative opinion.
According to opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the Bezuschussung of the pension fund traditional, carried out every year around this time could close the year successfully with almost 16.000 points.
Nevertheless the expert emphasizes that this year the things could develop something to themselves differently; particularly due to that already in the second December week, and accordingly directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution, occurring Endjahres-Rally.
In the view of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends.
According to assessment of Federico Olucha, analyst near the bank Inversis, the previous judgments for the market are on an almost technical level, which could result in a deviation from the index values that scales depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis being able soon to emerge.
The analyst trusts in these turning out positively.
During the selection of the values which are supposed to drive forward the Ibex to new maximums the analysts agree agreed to themselves.
Solana of Intermoney declares that this year it is up to the big values.
The expert would belong the two big banks and some immovable societies to the value-winners since the stream sector to the given time will be too expensive.
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of the bank Inversis assures that the rises will be accompanied in connection with the bank and industry sector.
If the Rally happens in fact, the immovable societies will profit by it.
The ACS was in the last months on catching course and we hope for other immovable societies as Ferrovial and FCC taking the same way, according to the expert.
With regard to the increased consumer behavior during Christmas Day the periodic consumption will determine the market event In the last year half.
On the other hand the expert believes that also the technologies will achieve positive sales results himself if they are represented on the Spanish market only in small number.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years December showed only in two cases sinking course courses.
When at the end of 2003 the technology-bubble burst, this led the stock exchange from their crisis and the up to now last real final year rallye initiated simultaneously.
This year in which the Ibex 35 caught up around 28,17 percent points December showed a course rise of 6,68 %.
Whether in 2008 the fifth profitable year becomes in consequence (the Ibex climbs since January around 8,36 %) and can show also an Endjahresrally will be proved.
Popular will have opened his 200 credit institutions of on Mondays until on Fridays for 12 hours on day.
Popular decided on modernizing a big part ofhis branches.
In in total 200 of them are settled in the economy-strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute which operates under the brand name Popular Max these subsidiaries mean a big milestone.
However also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular represents as a first bank consortium the jump, to extend on weekdays to 20.30h and to apply from 10h on Saturdays to 20.30h the opening times of his branches dares.
The bank consortium BBVA, who repeats also the prolongation of their opening times in the subsidiaries announce lies, did not take up to now yet any definitive decision.
The at the time of current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions to seem to aim at an agreement in the case of which 75 % of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for that on a weekday in the afternoon when neither for the custom.
Whether further banks follow the new initiative which adapts itself to the business opening times will depend on the empirical values of the Popular Bank.
And just that is also the intention that Popular withtheir project hunts.
It is objective to prolong the opening times of those branches which can capture the custom of independent, small and located centrally enterprises inclined to buy, but also the one of big department stores due to their situation.
The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, there it not around new, but changed opening times sells.
For that the bank will reshape the premises of those subsidiaries which are already in business zones, and they adjust to the individual customer profile of the different zones simultaneously.
So the enlargement of the opening times is joined with a new room organization of the branches which is characterized by a more current, more colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any greater investments, but it would be accompanied by an increased personnel attitude since a branch needed now no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The subsidiaries which will be endowed even with additional premises for the KMU will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular already at nine branches in Madrid tested hisdraft.
And the empirical values turned out positively, according to ÁngelRivero.
The subsidiaries of the streets bravo Murillo, O´Donell and the grain Vía were selected for that, which seems a clever decision to have been.
Popular currently guides approx. 2500 subsidiaries.
And wider 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized onto immigrants and point also enlarged opening times on, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model is not used the BBVA since most of them will offer a wide selection instead of this at non financial service services for the sale.
We would not like to represent any competition for our customers, Rivero declares.
With Telefonica they came temporarily to sell mobile telephones with the aid of external bank personnel for the agreement.
The Spanish private sender Telecinco doubles his market value and in an outdated way thus his rival Antena 3 for the first time.
We created it.
With this sentence the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, made his contentment known with stock exchange end. The sender guided by it had increased his value around the twofold one of his rival Antena 3.
An aspect, however, subdued his joy: That is exactly that something me is hurt; not, that we a higher growth, but, he stated that we had smaller losses.
It stressed that they did not sink in spite of the weak market far too deeply.
Telecinco ended yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54 %.
This profit reduces his previous this year's losses on 15,66 %.
According to information of Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4.488,88 million euros at which Mediaset controls the main part of the capital (52 %), and is shared to Vocento only with 13 % now.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percent points yesterday and has to announce since January a loss of in total 40,5 % so that his market value with 2.193,46 million amounts to half.
The market value of other stock exchange-noted communication enterprises on the other hand climbs; in the case of Sogecable on 3.571 million, at Prisa (Editor of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2.518,53 million and at Vocento on 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is a question of two similar enterprises, according to Vasile.
Still the question in which extent in fact we stock exchange technically can act appears uncertain for which price and as we can design it lucratively on customer level.
Telecinco explained his intention to climb up from advertising-gains this year to the first television broadcast station with more than 1000 million gross profits a week ago. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising-enterprise of the group.
If the intention should be turned over, the sender would increase his advertising-revenues by 3,6 % in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous year.

The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange course of Telecinco better in the comparison at the high Payout reason, that the company could show up to the present time: In 2006 the enterprise guided by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100-prozentige dividend distribution.
Vasile insures, however, that the reason after the purchase of 33 % of the parts of final moles, with media set as a holding company, still could vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to the official compromise, to pay at least 50 % of the parts even if we have declared more up to now always considerably.
I hope for our being able to satisfy our stockholders whose stock values we could already increase through the purchase from 33 % of the final mole parts this year.
According to statement of the analysts themarket points at the time of certain loss tendencies on.
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently his profit calculation around 7 % at Telecinco for this year around 4 % and for 2009.
This is the consequence of the shortening of the probable growth rate which will go back to 8,4 % and 2009 in 2008 of 10,5 % from 5,5 % on 5,1 %.
This reduced also the probable profit calculation from Antena 3 for 2008 around 4,5 % and for 2009 around 7,5 %.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: comes down his high effective net yield and be lasting potential and recommends therefore the purchase of both stocks.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco attributes (to buy) due to the multiple stimuli and the prosperierenden market a more useful position than Antena 3 (to hold).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends faced with the similar threats to neglect (satisfied market and worse economic climate) the expectations in both cases
The congress agrees to the guideline of the MIFID which came into force on 1st November.

The economic commission of the congress planned further changes afterwards still, at what the decision, that to have to be valid the debenture put titles on now due to their high risk degree for the investor as complex finance means, through the US Hypo bar and bank crisis has confirmed. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition one used the coming into effect of the guideline for the legal delimitation of the field of action of diplomierter economists; 30 years after that in 1977 the regulation which restricted the field of action reserved for the economists was issued.
The senate defined for his part new positions in the finance sector, how that the economic media gate's, that works onto foreign bill, no authorization on the part of the CNMV requires and can offer his services for the commercialization of products and for the customer production simultaneously several investment enterprises.
The harmonized consumer price index (VPI) increased in November around five tenths and is now near 4,1 %.
The indicator, the euro action to the the judgment of the inflation rate within the European Union serves, the average price development occurred in Spain in November delivers.
His publication corresponds to the basic principles of euro action and to the European central bank (EZB) that strives through the announcement of the data for a local and quality comparison to US products.
The prediction for the indicator can be created early when one uses the same procedure as with the harmonized consumer price index, but he uses various other statistical modelling concepts simultaneously still around those to the time of the calculation information not available estimate.
The Spanish statistics office (INE) admonished, however, that the early determined indicator is used only as a standard value, and does not have to agree with the final result that is announced on the coming 14th one December therefore.
The consumer price index (VPI) will keep on remaining on a relatively high level
According to statement of the deputy head of the government and the economic and finance minister Pedro Solbes, if the rise of the VPI is a temporary development in November; simultaneously this assured that the price index would keep on remaining in the coming months on a relatively high level.
Nevertheless Solbes found in the halls of the congress building, that even if the present number is not good, the inflation difference of Spain to the other members of the monetary union in the last years more or less now has stayed.
In addition it declared that there were less surprises in November than in the preliminary month at which the government did not reckon a so high rise.
We expected a value of about 4 %, the economic and finance minister announced with regard to the today published prediction.

The value supplies of Northern Rock sank around more than half did, after the bank in the middle of September of the last year crisis-conditional the British issuing bank around an emergency credit had asked, and they are in the meantime only still 12.000 million pounds (that corresponds to 16.800 million euros).
To this time the capital values of the bank were record-pregnant 25.000 million pounds, a sum, that sank through the confidence loss of the customers within two and a half months considerably and also in spite of the one hundred percent guarantee of the government, that the money is secure, to to the end of the crisis furthermore will sink.
The company Virgin which would continue with the group after the takeover under the brand name Virgin Money must bring in approximately a quarter of the revenues of the British banks which will consist of the installations of the next three years there in order to acquire those 18 billion pounds which are still needed for the attaining of their objective by 30 billion exactly.

The mayor arrested by Totana because of supposed suspicion of participation onto city-structural corruption
The Spanish police arrested at the present morning the present mayor of the small town Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the municipality Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement into city-structural corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition another of the secretaries of the district council and the head of the municipality police were arrested.
The office of Juan Morales represented José Martínez Andreo last May, currently representatives' of the Partido Popular and to the former time chairpersons' of the district council of Totana, and the initial wire-puller of the plot could be according to information of the radio station Cadena SER.
The officials keep on searching the business documents of the municipality and the ministry for city planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition the attorney was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of city-structural corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information of the Cadena SER the attorney of the popular, and consequently privileged representative Juan Morales was arrested during the abandonment of the residence of his mandator due to important loading documents that are supposed to be related with the plot.
In addition other information sources report about the supposed task payments of Morales to a galizisches building contractor which planned the end of a city-structural contract in which the development of a 200 hectares big face was concluded.

Bono declares itself, the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo understood and, trap of a choice victory, to accept in the congress.
The former defense minister José Bono accepted the offer of the government president and secretary-general of the socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly he will lead the list of the PSOE candidates at the coming general choices in Toledo and, in the case of a choice victory of the socialists, the office of the congress president take over.
So it of José Blanco announced to organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero occurred today in the head office of the party.
In the view of the head of the government the offer is onto the former minister justified since it is important in the politics to be able to count on the best and is Bono among the best.
In addition the politician coming from the Mancha would run in the case of a victory for the socialists at the coming choices according to all appearance as a chairperson of the congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as a congress president. This had announced on the last 15th one November not to enter upon more at the next general choices, to end his career in the public politics and to support the climate protection instead of this in the on-campus field.
The former minister had to admit that the government president would have insisted on the political event continuously since his resignation two years ago onto his return.
Furthermore it referred to who would take over the post of the congress president in the case of a choice victory not wanting to withhold the party from the citizens, as with the appointment of the vice-president for economy, and referred to this as an act of the transparency.
If it should take over the office in fact, he hopes so the chamber into a house the respect's and not the insult's or the yelling's to convert in order to make her appear so increasingly more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately one gains from time to time the impression as if the single place in which one can not talk in Madrid quietly and calmly were the congress; so the government president was interrupted in the senate once up to 26 times.
Simultaneously he praised the current president Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out, it does not want to raise the appearance to already have taken over the office since otherwise his political opponents would refer to this as arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate subjects both the sceptics of the climate change and those ones that put a social and political debate into the foreground concerning that of a merciless criticism, the movement must put than whole a strong cohesion on the day.
Particularly if it is a question of a chief of the movement, which, as in the case of the government president Zapatero, the fight against the climate change for more important holds than the abatement of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests, to sign a new contract with the planet.
This proposal brings it, however, into declaration need concerning the action, and/or non-action of his government which contributed decisively to Spain standing within the EU at the top of the countries which fulfilled the handicaps of the Kioto-protocols most the least.
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfilment of the handicaps, to which sectors is this to be put down, and why did his government which had suggested the contract with the planet not stop this development.
In addition it is now forced, the Spanish citizens designated that one from it measures against the climate change without explaining Umschweife.
Which companies will be affected by that, which behavior of the citizens is supposed to be changed, which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and which economical consequences result from that.
More precisely said who must sacrifice himself and will pay himself for the rescue of the planet.
However, it has and none will give to suchdeclarations in future.
Just because it is a question of the Aufopfern and the paying foritself.
Because the measures which can really be used against the climate change are unpopular.
You are costs-rich, uncomfortable and alarming for the accounts of the companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the PSOE appeared seenly choice-strategically so dangerous to Zapatero that he saw itself forced to take back the proposal again.
Correspondingly it is valid now, the planet with Nothing, to save therefore with pure propaganda and empty sayings without every real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet the else politicians, so suitable for choice campaigns, must talk neither, still accuse, still demand, follow the pretentious edition, however, instead of this, to decorate the meetings and to inspire with his gentleness and kindness other.
This can happen, however, only then if the contract does not differ from his nature virtual in that and does not pretend either accordingly that the bike becomes the only moving means in the future or we may refresh ourselves only with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement into a city-structural corruption.
The Guardia Civil arrested the mayor of the small town Totana belonging to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo.

A colleague informs of the photo of illegal Internetdownloads into the penal code:
A. The Download of a song would be a law break, that affects with six months of custody.
If you, however, wiederrum rob a music business under a value of 400 euros, this is valid so only as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft becomes then indeed as Straftateingestuft, nevertheless the punishment precipitates in a smaller way than at a Download (Article 234 penal code).
C. If you steal a car and return it later again forty hours, the punishment is still smaller then than at a Download (Article 244.1).
D. Participating in a fight less fatally than in a music data exchange is.
To participate in a rebellious quarrel an imprisonment of three to 12 months after themselves pulls (Article 154 penal code), during the data exchange a deprivation of liberty of six months up to two years for the consequence has
(Article 270 penal code).
E. To the article 184.2 of the penal code sexual molestation is considered at the job as less badly than the download of a DVD-film from the Internet is.
F. The trade with copyright-protected films whose authorization did not occur through the authors is exposed to a higher punishment than the distribution of pornografischen film material onto minors (Article 186) is.
Now yes, therefore if my colleague should have right, then somebody screwed his demands highly very beautifully, however.

My family doctor presents one of his long, strange research articles with the title to me: Money leads to activation of certain brain fields, particularly, if the other ones get more from that.
Therefore the feelings arising through the monthly payment of salary are dependent on the content of the colleagues.
The study was created with the aid of a tomographisch-magnetic reference analysis at the Bonn university, and the results were published in the last edition of the science-magazine Science.
According to statement of Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was then strongest if the participant gave correct answers and on the other hand his other player failed.
The researchers could recognize that the brain activities always very much moderat turned out if both participants with their answer were correct and got also the same salary accordingly; but if one of them received the double one, it resulted also in a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure to myself, whether in fact it requires so much scientific expenditure to reach for such a result.

Which insurance is suitable for me best?
The KFZ insurance that covers a possible damage case caused by the driver contains a high cost whose height wiederrum depends on different factors, and other from age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, kind of the car to be insured and his use, and so forth.
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found in an even more difficult way than the correct vehicle model is.
At first once it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here.
An selfinsurance is an agreement between an assurance company and an insured.
This agreement to present the corresponding indemnity in a damage case is held in writing by means of a contract of insurance which determines that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in the corresponding train.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists through several factors, and other age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or that use.
The insurance enterprises set their prices according to the statistics so that with a higher danger of accident also higher contribution payments become due.
For this reason must both more than 25-year than also women of few contribution payments achieve, because statistics prove that these groups show a smaller accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same one is valid also for married persons, there this according to statement of the statistical values and accordingly also according to conviction of the enterprises, to less accidents tend as singles.
The benefit that is attributed to the vehicle influences the frequency of the driving and in this way also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more probably the damage.
The insurances must consider a whole series of points at the installation of the premium.
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly in order to select the selfinsurance which complies with his personal needs at the ehesten exactly.
We list at this place the most important points that one should take into account during the selection of an insurance now around not only one power-, but to be able to find also a price-oriented choice.
The less than 25-year long ones encounter numerous obstacles, as e.g. the small going-practice and the young driver's license, during the choice of an economical insurance.
Nevertheless, even if it was for an ideal insurance cover best to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance, there are more economical alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select one Vollkasko with deduction so that indeed the services of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered, but they are offered for a low price.
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount itself arisen from the damage.
The amount is defined before end of the contract and by means of the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly ever smaller the sum to be paid, Luis Nogüra, main representative of Spain, declares near ridge Europe, a mediation enterprise for online insurances.
Another option is not the enlarged insurance that insures the customer against external accident damages, however, against the harm arisen at the own car.
In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here a council.
If you are less than 25 years old, it suits in your hand to lower the insurance costs; so your credit increases itself when you attempt to go cautiously and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the base rate near the corresponding assurance company.
In the opposite for this purpose a punishment paymentcontains an increase of said rate.
The height of credits and punishment payments depend from the society and those one profits.
If the enterprise has a profit-rich year behind itself, can be taken the liberty to increase the bonus-payments, Nogüra explains.
As soon as the 25-year brand is crossed, it is simpler for the drivers to sign a contract. Reason for that is the fact that with increasing going-practice the accident rate sinks.
Thus it is most reasonable to decide for a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction.
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience no, both in the case of an accident and at the moment of the driving not, explains that one Spanish chief of the European enterprise, and adds, that the majority of the accidents to happen in the second practice year after the fear of the beginner was put aside.
Nevertheless it is with a married customer who does not have any children more advisable to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance; natural only then, if it also approves the financial situation of the corresponding person.
On the part of the insurers married couples with children are regarded as the customers with the least accident rate, and correspondingly low also their contribution payments turn out.
In This Case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction would be (with an amount around the 300 euros) the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, an enlarged insurance that starts first to the third vehicle year is recommended.
You go more loosely in total and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to apply a higher contribution payment Luis Nogüra states.
For pensioners it is good to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount around the 150 euros), or an enlarged insurance which does not start before with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally one must observe that the selfinsurance is something very important not only, because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also, because it contains high costs that require it, that a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation is found.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes into Milan onto the point for the dividinginto eight parts final
The FC kite and the Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point that they lack on the coming Tuesday in San Siro in order still to reach their respective objectives for end of the Championsleague qualifying round. The Italians need the point in order to reach the top of their group while this is deciding on their participation near the bulkheads.
The Italian team has already five points and confirmed their participation already in the fifth round with a draw during which Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another further in Portugal in order surely that the frame check sequence Shakhtar with six points does not haul in the Befica Lissabon with four points to go.
The two games of the group D will occur a week in front of end of the sixth game round since the frame check sequence Milan at the FIFA Club world championship in Japan, which occurs at the 16ten, where he will fight for the entry at the 13ten in the semifinal for the first time into the final must line up.
So this group will be finished before all other and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion for the on all sides expected result, even if both teams will attempt to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home indeed the Keltik Glasgow knows, that they would become in the case of a victory and would have a better starting position in this way in the dividing into eight parts final.
A defeat could suffice for the team of Gordon Strachan even with a setback of the frame check sequence Shakhtar in order to qualify. Nevertheless he should not trust all too much in such circumstances, because with nine points level stands the Ukrainians the participation; those ones had lost last week in Glasgow indeed (2-1), however during the second game could win (2-0).
Accordingly the May countries will attempt therefore, the bulkheads the evening too vermiesen. The wiederrum hope for achieving the dividing into eight parts final of the reshaped Championsleague for the second time in consequence after they in the vorrangehenden game season in exactly the same round through a gate of Kaka in the consequence time (1-0) and were conquered through one zero to zero draw on the first leg.
While the frame check sequence Shakhtar is waiting to the Rossoneri for the victory, the team will have to concentrate on the own game since both the attaining of the dividing into eight parts final and his membership near the UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lissabon could achieve the third place in spite of his lower table position and without the chance to keep on being allowed to participate in the greatest European championship through a victory and play thus near the UEFA.
20.000 people attend the first concert of the Spice girls tour inVancouver.
The Spice girls gave in the Canadian Vancouver in front of the eyes of 20.000 spectators the starting shot for their first tour after the solution of the band in the year 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared GM Place de Vancouver shortly before beginning of their concert in the stadium, that the the atmosphere in the reunited band is jutting out.
Around the 20.000 people could live through the concert in the stadium sold out in the case of which a video for the history was shown to the band that end of the nineties had guaranteed for sensation.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album which contains their greatest hits and two more new songs, Headlines and voodoo, and that in Spain under the label of EMI appears.
The five members of the Spice girls bore golden armlets on the stage, that them the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, before had given.
The sportsman was found under the fan measures in the public, that the GM Palace glow to the brought, although the nerves of his spouse had forbidden Victoria it it in the preliminary days.
During the preparations to the Schow Victoria Beckham made announce that the British star did not get our wardrobe any only time to face, and therefore I am already very tightened, which it will hold from the appearance.
Sporty Spice, which exit involved the solution of the group two years later from the group in the year 1998 due to internal differences of opinion, expressed their nervousness two hours in front of the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed that the feelings too the Spice girls had changed.
And therefore I thought, why actually not; therefore I am pleased at that, hit this decision to have, Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that had arranged for it nine years ago.
The singer made announce in addition that the quarrels were removed and they all have themselves again very much with pleasure in the meantime.
Nevertheless many things have changed themselves since the last common appearance of the Spice girls in the year 1998.
At first once the Virgin Airlines reached the group according to report of the television broadcast station CTV in a special machine in Vancouver.
With their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army from nurses.
The five of them have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver the band will act as next one in California, in San José (at the 4ten December) and in Los Angeles (at the 5ten and 7ten December).
In Madrid they will step at the 23ten December on the stage.
New apprehensions above natural gas quarrel between Russia and Ukraine
A new price quarrel smolders between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of combustible are influenced to Western Europe.
The biggest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European Union (EU) is led through Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is observed very exactly.
Kiev warned, that if Moscow increases the price that it must pay for the natural gas, it of Russia higher transit fees into account will put.
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced deliveries into the EU-states.
The recent quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom attempt to achieve an agreement how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008.
According to Gazprom more must be charged Ukraine since the company group arranged up to 50 % to pay for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states at conversations", the economic minister of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh the news agency of Reuters said.
"The natural gas prices changing themselves should be combined beyond doubt with our arguments concerning the height of the transit fees [to Western Europe] about Ukraine."
In the last great natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 Gazprom shortened deliveries into Ukraine.
This led to consequence for a case of the exports to Western Europe, which pushed up the prices drastically.
A quarter of the supply of the European Union forms Russian gas.
Russia has the worldwide greatest gas occurrences, but a lot of that remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom complements his own inventory with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS must control foreign employees
The Scotch State National Health Service must improve the controls of the prior conviction registers for employees of outside of Europe, a member of the control organ said. outside
The recommendation of the main finance controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought by Glasgow in Scotland in Zusammmenhang with the assault on the airport in June.
Black expressed also about that objections that the Scotch state National Health Service does not have any precise ideas with regard to the number of his ausländischischen employees.
But his report referred to other important controls being carried out by five health authorities at a random sample correctly.
The main finance controller examined personnel which was recruited outside of the countries of the European market in consequence of the assault for the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Krankenhaus in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a ground car was driven by the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in October in a video signal transmission in the Old Bailey, and was burdened in connection with the probable self bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State National Health Service previously of the employment of foreign employees carries out controls in order to guarantee that these have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations in order to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland for the inspection of prior conviction registers, the agency does not decree about the responsibility to obtain these information outside of Great Britain.
The report of the main tester says now, next to other recommendations, that the executive board is supposed to pick up guidelines of the police records departure that helps employers with controls in different countries.
"Although we found references to these controls in some personnel documents, these were not carried out routinely." the report found.
Black said the Scotch health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines before the employment with high measure, however, added: "Our report shows fields in which the system can be improved in order to guarantee that precise information about the number of the foreign National Health Service employees are available."
BMA Scotland chairperson Dr. Peter Terry said it is "extremely improbable", that investigations previously of the employment of potential NHS employees would identify people that could inspect future terrorist assaults.
"In the report it is called, that current Voranstellungstests of the NHS Scotland function well and it is not clear which added value the recommendations will supply", he said.
The Scotch health authorities say that they currently have 1.161 foreign employees the predominant majority of that doctors and nurses.
However, the finance controller warned against the number being probably higher also therefore because the executive boards would have problems to identify those employees that are on leave onto indefinite time.
The investigation kept on finding, that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, to have been stopped and Lothian mainly.
Passport, work permit, and qualification controls appertain tothat.
the Scotch government checks currently their politics and guidelines for controls before employment beginning for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said: It was to me to carry out a request onto the Glasgow airport this work faced with the terrorist attack."
It added that the recommendations of the report consider the Scotch government, in connection with the health authorities, and would guarantee that the best practices reflected in updated guidelines concerning the control investigations previously of the employment of all employees again - under that also that one from the exterior - that publication is planned next month.

Arrested in 208 in Saudi Arabia because of a terror plot
Saudi Arabia uncovered yesterday that it arrested in 208 militant because of their affiliation to cells that had planned an imminent attack onto an oil installation as well as onto priests and security forces.
The state television of the world-tallest oil exporter said that one of the cells would have intended to smuggle in missiles.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaida started a campaign against the monarchy which since 2003 an ally of the United States is in consequence of the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militant ones, mentioned by a foreign citizen, planned an assault on an oil installation in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia formed one 35.000 man strong fast one griffin troop around Anlagennach an unsuccessful Al Quaida-Anschlag onto the world-biggest oil processing installation in Abqaiq in 2006 protect.
The report, with reference to an innenministerliche declaration, says that 18 of the arrested ones belonged to a cell which was led by a "missile expert" which immigrated illegally to the country.
He tells that the militant ones would have intended to smuggle in eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Further 22 of the prisoners planned according to the report to kill priests and security forces.
The government warned priests more to do in order to stop Saudis that strive for Iraq around themselves to put together militias that want to fight the allied armed forces and the US-supplementary schiitische Muslim government with Al Qaida that of the hardliner's among the sunnitischen Saudis as heretical is looked.
To consider Al Qaida militias many priests in Saudi Arabia than in collaboration standing with the authorities in the support of the politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied from calls of Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida Führer born in Saudi Arabia, to aim at the prowestern Saudi government it - targeted it on foreign residential areas, government buildings and installations of the energy sector.
"This was very great effort of the security forces about the last ones... five months", a speaker of the Ministry of the Interior informed the state television.
The arrests affected also a "media cell" of 16 from Medina that it aimed at that to advertise the "Takfiri Denken" - the ideology the radical sunnitischen Muslims that violence against Muslims that becomes gebranntmarkt as unbelievers and apostates supports.
Among the arrested ones also 32 people that were accused were provided to the militias financial support have.
The climate on the Venus could give the future of the earth a view let
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place for the life, scientists said yesterday.
Data of a European spaceship contained on an orbit show that the planet resembles an averted twin of the earth still more than was up to now conscious.
The Venus is the näheste planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have the same size approximately and have similar orbits of a planet, however, the Venus of the sun is a little nearer.
Before billions of years would have been there on the Venus' conditions, that would have been very similar to those ones on the earth and would have even habitable can be, scientists believe today.
But because of the unmoderated carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the Venus broke a very different development course to the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation speed.
Today the planet of water is robbed and a surface temperature that is hot enough has to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and flash storms.
The findings of the space probe of Venus Express of the European space travel agency that examined the Planten for a year offer a sobering look on that, as the earth in the face of the catastrophic climate changes' could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the Oxford university, one of the conductors of the Venus express mission, said: Realizes why the climate is so different on the Venus to that of the earth while the planets are being quite similar otherwise."
"Our new data it facilitates, to construct a scenario in which the Venus began before billions of years as the earth, possibly with one habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo radioactive material, according to reports enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slowakian and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material is examined.
It did not confirm whether it was a question of enriched uranium, but he said that for 1 million dollars sold (480,000 pounds) it would have it to become can.
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said, he does not consider worthily of a premiership candidate to be consulted from a snowman.
In spite of that the republican candidate for the premiership declared himself ultimately readily to be confronted with a debate on YouTube in which normal voters video questions and submit questions in order to send it to the candidate.
None of the questions that were raised at the Wednesday evening, the 28th November, were as ridiculous as the snowman was, the democrats' about the global warming in the YouTube Debatte of the other party questioned.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time the state of the republican party which opens into the choices in the next year exactly.
It is not known, exactly as the producers of CNN, which supported the debate that clips selected the prospective candidate to YouTube to be shown.
Yet in the first half hour of the debate, the longest the a single topic was dedicated, immigration stood in the center.
The topic is one of the strongest topics for republicans.
The CNN asked a group to operate a dial from undecided voters if they heard things that they liked: The TV organization noticed tops of the approval than the candidates talked about the borders severely.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney which shifted itself forward in the decisive inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, it was soft with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in that it the former governor immigrants accused by Massachusetts, illegal for work at his house have prepared.
The two stopped especially hard than interrogators asked whether an "amnesty" (that would give illegal a regular status and the possibility onto the citizenship) would support to one of the candidates.
More insignificant candidates as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congress representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congress representative from Colorado, it succeeded with this topic nachzuhaken.
No one of the two men has serious chances during the nomination, but both stay in the running, maybe because they formerly and in a harder way beat onto the immigration bass drum as other.
To divide into the field of the immigration at least the candidates on the whole the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance opposite illegal migrants.
This topic, together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world, the differences help the republicans with forgetting or minimizing between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate brought unequivocally problematic as other topics for the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked to, for which it supported arm restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture.
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidatesbelieve every word of the Bible.
This resulted in Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book, it the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal believes.
A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the deathpenalty|capital punishment.
Mike Huckabee - now towards all expectations on the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - it said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it, he laughed at that and said Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office.
The race remains unusually far open.
Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and his storms of applause in the debate of Wednesday.
These two shot up from the nothingness, because the two wings of the party up to now not yet onto one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could.
Per year in 1980 and 2000 a candidate united the party with a victorious message about the size of Americas and a winking to both wing of the party from the beginning and convincingly.
This time the party is fissured and the result is not clear by far.
Pains of the Labour-party
Gordon Brown discovered another further pit for the falling in; his way from this out stays the same one.
For British scandals this is not especially slippery.
No nobility titles seem to have been sucked sold any politician Paris hotel bills pays any extramarital toes.
However the exposure, that a rich businessman Spenden for the British ruling Labour party above more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 millions of dollars) more than four years under the name of other people disguised, and that the party failed to announce this, is something without that that one fought Gordon Brown good would have managed.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had escaped from the demand for a choice, in stupid way the intelligence of the Britons offending when he said that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead of this as Vince Cable, the representation chairperson of the Liberal democrats astute in increasing measure, expressed it the at one time feared Brown of Stalin to Mr has itself. Bean developed.
The awkward rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, regulatorische weakness and bad discernment pointed under bombardment.
Proposals badly thought over for the change of the tax laws set Unternehmensverbände against the government.
The tax-official loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative botches.
A trio of generals retiredly started a revolt in the House of Lords from protest against shortenings of military editions: To be minister of the armed forces, so they claimed, a partial time job is.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours secretary-general (and their former fulfillment conductor) already resigned.
Nothing of that means that Brown breaks direction resignationirrevocably open.
Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to which they feel impossibly to rule.
Neither like still people trust in politicians, nevertheless they restrain usually their skepticism if a new troop catches the office.
If it is once clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he needs not to be not even long in this case yet, this delay is past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press searches for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way the position of Brown is especially difficult because he can not say unlike other political leaders to be a new broom.
So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny, he hisfirst lieutenant was.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax responsibility documents, for example, love together with decisions that Brown made as a chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if that one was not directly involved into Blair misfortunes - as to suffice at that one "money for nobility title" investigation of political party financing - the voters assume possibly that it was it.
In spite of that situation is not very as bad to Browns as it looks
The misdemeanors are not as terrible as the conservatives describe it.
As at Mr. Bean, nobody died, or was entirely cheated.
And the antidote, painful as it likes to be, is to be delivered, which Browns always promised of course stalinistische tendencies: A reliable, sound one and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss around political donations is a goodexample.
The garböske one Abraham's, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, he says wants no public recognition for his goodwill.
Maybe that likes to be like this, but he was not entitled to thedecision on that.
The laws against anonymity for tall political contributors are clear and they exist for an unequivocal reason: the public has to know a right to who access to those that rule over the country can be bought.
Watt, the says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, however not, that it is illegal, has to put as a matter of course some questions'; exactly as Jon Mendlesohn, Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber, who was told about the strange donations in October.
However, up to now Brown is not shared: There is not anything, that it indicates that that he knew about this confusion although the biggest part of the payments was done after his office takeover in June.
Up to now the prime minister finished half of the work.
He condemned the injury of the laws fast through his party, but it diluted this determination by the reaching after a known instrument, an investigation committee on the topic - led by a bishop retiredly and a judge in order to make the measure full.
"In This Case" the "lessons to be drawn from that are not verycomplicated.
If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.
Foreseen from that that one gives other things it Mr Brown must do, to find a permanent chairperson for the independent committee for standards in the public life that is vacant since six months as something, and to stride from political party financing ahead with a reform reaching through.
That would require from the hardliners of the Labour to co-operate with the conservatives and to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions possibly - bitter pills for a party comrade as Mr Brown.
But it should be some biased facts conscious.
The conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls; it has to recover two years around voters; and the only way it can achieve a victory is through incontestable honesty and sound competence.
Card sharks
Does the credit crisis of Americas infectKreditkartenmarkt?
If blood is in the water, it is is only natural, that dorsal fins spin annoyed.
Now where Americas' property market kränkelt, the predators have the credit card market of the country in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs reckon that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the danger of infection of unterfinanzierten credits onto other forms of verb smoking credits spreads.
Signs of the strain are clearly visible.
There are rises both at the Ausbuchungen and with the delay rates which measure the part of the credits which are not too late in each case in a retractable way or more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced in the last month that it took one to 1,4 billion dollars fee elevation from their American consumer financing partial because of the weakness of credit card takers.
Nevertheless it is too early in order to sink into panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3.89% was almost a full percent point under the historical average.
The deterioration with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors.
A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case from bankruptcy registration that form in turn for a big part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of the registration (and in this way delay fees) would go up again, whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not.
The industry reports also about sound payment rates which show how much of their debts the consumers pay off every month
and the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, in spite of the standstill in other corners of the structured financing.

The card exhibitors look, however, at the money river instead of onto capital values, therefore falling house prices do not activate of necessity a change in the creditworthiness of the applicant for the credit.
You can be even for the card exhibitors of advantage.
The stimuli for consumers, to keep on paying the mortgage rates, sink if the immovables are less value than the value of the loan; as a result the card debts become more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can react to the stormier conditions also much more quickly and more flexibly as credit grantors when they change interest rates or credit borders.
That should reduce theoretically the risk of a fast re-evaluation of the capital values.
"We will not wake up one day and completely revalue the loans", Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance speaker, says.
Even if a sudden shortage crisis is improbable in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit decrease America are urgent into the recession, the industry will stand beyond doubt a grimmer future ago.
They keep on holding look-out to these shark fins.
British Bänker plead guilty in the case Enron
Three British bankers that should be put in court by Enron, Andrew Fastow, for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main finance conductor changed on Wednesday their requests in guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were open originally for seven cases of fraud by application of tele means of communication for the alleged conspiring with Fastow in a secret finance fraud in the year 2000 in order to enrich at the expense of their employer innocently pleaded.
The procedure had been applied on January.
But during a hearing in court in front of US district judge Ewing Werlein Junior everyone pleaded for a case of fraud guiltily by application of tele means of communication.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in Great Britain in the course of delivery procedures which lasted two years.
In the United States their case is a rid end of an investigation which was started after Enrons breakdown in 2001.
The accusations originally submitted against them in the year 2002 made attentive Fastow on his being the objective of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron Niedergang.
The accusation against the bankers - mentioned the "NatWest Three" - says they came in the year 2000 to Houston about one fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper hatch.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership from Enron that was controlled by Fastow that was the architect of innumerable fraudulent Enron-machinations that helped to tear the company into the bankruptcy whirlpool.
At the beginning of 2002 their participation in the subsidiary had estimated the value at zero the bank, but the three British men knew that she had considerable value in reality.
An enterprise under Koppers control acquired the parts of the bank of the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid Kopper 250.000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise.
According to the accusation Fastow held by mistake that the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for their parts of the subsidiary opposite Enron.
However, in fact the 20 million dollars went onto the British bankers, Fastow and other ones.
The bankers received 7.3 millions of dollars, during Fastow, Kopper and other about 12.3 millions of dollars absahnten, according to the accusation.
In the January 2004 known Fastow in two charges on conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy guilty.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow sits out a 6-year long imprisonment in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper sits out a punishment of three years and a month in an equipment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot due to one 1 millions of dollars of bail that it required that they lived in the United States in expectation of the legal proceedings.
Enron, once the seventh-greatest enterprise of the nation, crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of bookkeeping tricks could not make more disguise the billion debts longer or appear schwächelnde enterprises profitable.
The breakdown destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars retirement plans from.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former one executive board chairpersons' Jeffrey Skilling last year for their roles in connection with the Enron breakdown was condemned to.
Skilling sits out a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays condemnation for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became vain after he passed away last year because of heart illness.
Not very below in Moscow
The price of an airplane of the brand Gulfstream G550, endowed with a Rolls-Royce-engine and range enough in order to fly from Moscow non-stop to Los Angeles is near at least 54 million dollars.
But that is small change for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers place for up to 18 passengers", Dan Firer, a Gulfstream-representative, said.
"But no one of you asks for as many seats because it is for a private family or an enterprise president."
Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand on the last Friday during the millionaire exhibition, one four day's orgy of consumption set for the show that was organized in an encapsulated exhibition center at the outskirts of a town of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream more than 200 other luxury providers had built up booths, on that hoping, to interest again to money come Russians at everything, of mahogany-paneled yachts up to diamond-excessive selfcrickets that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer took cautiously a shining orangenen Porsche into the visor at the next booth.
"That is a beautiful car, but it is small change in comparison with us", he said.
"To the United States Russia is the second-largest market for private airplanes."
The Russian capital seems heated from an oil boom as floodedly with money as Dallas to his heydays does.
"We went through the same phase into the 1890ern, as if Amerikaner unites too gigantic fortune came and into crowds to Europe would go where they were regarded as materialistic" Mars resonance Goldman, a scientist, would say at the Davis center for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Harvard university.
As the Saudi-Arabian Überflieger of the 1970th and the Japanese in the 1990ern, the Russians protrude as the free money output units most visible in the world.
The most excluding luxury brands search theirpart at the gold drunkenness.
Elsewhere in Moscow in this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairperson of LVMH, put on in order ideas over how one can sell hochpreisige goods on markets as Russia to be exchanged.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald tribunes that the New York Times Company belongs.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have in total 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition 103.000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class that a total of 670 billion dollars are worth according to a study about the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, that of economic experts of the center for economic and finance research, an expert committee here, was written.
(The World Bank says that per year in 2005 15,8 percent of the Russians lived under the bare subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore we all are here, Nicole Marais, a sale and marketing representative of David Morris, told to a London jeweler".
She had gone to the fair for the first time together with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplarily well-kept and the men are all property worth."
While they are pulling Sunday night into evening dress through the halls, two immovable brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, call 26, themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked after the cars and I attempt to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and Porsche", Ms Yumatova who delivered the designer clothing which supported it, as a Roter-Teppich-Veteran with Joan Rivers, said.
It seemed the fair in the first place to aim at the new-rich ones to stand the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers that would be ready several hours in the jam in order to go to a drafty warehouse that geschmachloserweise Cadillac of Escalades, jackknives of platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, tailor-made Billiardtische, flatlets in Dubai and Gund teddy bear next to each other set.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollar).
"The Russians are interested to learn at that which brand the most expensive and best is" said Mr Gijrath that at a booth of the Dutch Porcelain Manufacturer Royal Delft fit patriotically before a wall-large Imitat of a Rembrandt picture from hand-painted, blue tesseras.
"Russians are natural more at Klimper-Klimperinterests."
In Fact the traders say here, that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is according to Russian standards old) already of pretentious logos for the kind of sober brands with restricted numbers of items have moved, that would not commercialize themselves with a commercial show.
In spite of that several thousands of people pushed, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists every day through the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday Roman Ershov said, the general manager of King Koil beds here, he would sell two 70.000 dollar mattress sets, produced from silk, Kaschmir and cotton, with gold threads sewn in.
Also in the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sale manager for A1 Moto, of a company said the High-End-Autos with High-End-Alarmsystemen equips, that his company sold the garish orangenen Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170.000 dollars.
Up to the Sunday afternoon Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A, said. Connection, an enterprise that adjusts luxury cars onto customer requirements, he would have sold three car radiator grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble chain bracelets tied together with each other for each 55.000 dollars.
It showed a reporter a car tire which was developed for a Russian casino owner with spokes which it had cladded with colored Swarovski Kristallen so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The costs: 22.000 dollars for a four substitute.
"The Russian millionaire, the bunch leather wheels' or a picture of the face of his wife of cubic zirconium would like to have", will not "go" unconditional on these wheels", Mr Karapetian said.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-cars' garage."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said the phrase "Russiche Millionäre" would currently not express a lot of exclusivity faced with the rise of the local immovable prices.
"If you three or four years ago have bought an apartment in Moscow, they are already presumably millionaire, at least on the paper, when already not in cash", he said.
"There are more of those ones than you believe."
Those ones, that no millionaires could be at least so to do as if they were rich at a state that was practiced from Alliance Continental, a Russian property administration enterprise.
The enterprise had set up four red telephone boxes according to British Model which were crammed with mountains of wrong million-Dollarscheinen.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the enterprise, said his employees would have printed 500.000 wrong bank notes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped in order to throw around the money heaps, mobile telephone photos, while they are leaning back among the replacement fortune, to make be punched from friends, or simply past a few a million put in.
"See in Moscow everyone as a millionaire can feel", Mr Karryev said.
Bungled operation presumed with death in New Jersey
It the day was here before the Thanksgiving Day as Ronald Livingston through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant saw and observed as an ambulance at the white cape Cod two doors wider below at the west Scott Avenue stopped.
Soon on that a police car was there.
And then a further one was there.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical coroner approaching", Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, said, on Wednesday.
"That was the point than I knew that somebody had died."
The Behören found out that the dead Ms Olga Arroyo, 41, was, an assistant of the director of the Newarker police department.
Now the observers attempt to find out whether she died because of a procedure that was carried out by a not authorized, cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify and that in the house at the west Scott Avenue 212 worked.
The authorities did not find yet what Ms Arroyos has caused death, and are hopeful, that toxokologische investigations that results could be unavailable for weeks will help with clearing up a mysterious death the one grief through the leadership top of the Newark Polizei has sent.
An assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, was Ms Arroyo since September 2006, and their voice was known to many in the department.
"It was loyal, hard working and stubborn", Mr McCarthy said about Ms Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said, that Ms Arroyo was the woman of Jimmy Arroyo, to one former Newarker police officers, that works for the Alkoholkontrollkomission, and that they leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the public prosecutor of union county, Theodore J. Romankow, said that observers would attempt to find out whether Arroyo passed away as a result of a not approved, surgical treatment.
"That is one of the possibilities", Ms Walsh said.
"It is a current investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Ms Arroyo on a sofa.
It was declared on site for death.
More than one week went by and the authorities informed of little about their investigation or over that one owner of the house that is presented as a pile Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms Castro was consulted bythe authorities.
The observers attempt to find out whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door at woman Castros house where a wilted rose shrub is in the brief front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labels with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was in the parking place next to a door that led to the basement.
Zwei Mountainbikes hanged from hooks on a page.
McCarthy said, that than it arrived for the first time in Newark, after he had spent 25 years with the New York police department, Ms Arroyo of inestimable value was and it helped him in this case to zurechtfinden in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You must pay attention to this or that'" hesaid.
"It was always here, than I arrived here and it wasalways here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
To lower hopes that the central bank the interests will lead to the rise of the world share markets
The stocks jumped yesterday on both pages of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will attempt to calm the credit markets through further reductions of the rate of interest through appeasing comments of the vicechairperson of the US were confirmed central bank.
The share markets increased in London, New York and in whole Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairperson of the central bank, said that the politics "flexibly and pragmatically" must react to the continuous pressure on the financial markets.
To calm peevish markets in a clear effort, faced with signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence would have reversed in part some of the improvements of the market functions from the late part of September and October.
If the increased turbulence should keep on existing, it would increase the possibility of a further sharpening of the financial conditions for consumers and enterprises, he said.
The comments were picked up by investors as a signal, that the central bank is ready to intervene and to stabilize the credit conditions with new capital syringes into the US markets and possible further reductions of the rate of interest.
The carrying out helped with calming also the rampart Street, faced with further bad news from the US economy, now since the sales of US immovables achieved a new record depression in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement from Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that they will remove 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide employees, in order to balance difficult losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector, in a measure for the cost reduction.
It is expected that only 20 will disappear from these places in London, where the bank employs 1.500 employees.
Into New York the Dow Jones industry index jumped around 331 points, or 2,55 percent in order to close at 13.289,40 during which more widely-fed S&P 500 index around 2.65 percent climbed.
In London index increased to the FTSE 100 around 165,5 points, or 2,7 percent in order to close at 6.306,2 which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British default values.
Germany's index Dax increased around 2,6 percent and France's CAC40 went up around 2,3 percent.
Before the re-emergence had been underlined by credit pressure on the markets, after strong demand at an auction of three month guarantee means of the European central bank that the European Commercial Banks were given to were lent too considerable 4,7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
To follow the pressure onto the bank from England, the US's central bank and the European Central Bank and to enter further capital means into the money markets in London, went up, than one the credit tensions the three month's "Libor" rates for the lending between UK banks to go up onto their highest with 6,59 percent since the late September saw, after a continuous increase since the 21st November.
England confronted with decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them in an almost just as difficult way asthe other one.
Who is supposed to beat as a number 6 for England into Kandy at this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make the decision?
The second question is important, because David Graveney, the choice chairperson, on call at least under this specific title, here is, around which to help Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan with deciding manager, and because the table of High Morries, the English managerial director, fills itself with applications for national voter offices by degrees, otherwise even for which ones in partial time.
Whoever does not get the sixth brawler position will be unhappy, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it beyond doubt.
It is never simple to nail exactly what a human being facilitates to reach the top of his of Berufszweiges while somebody is differently never coming out about the lowest rank sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection, where judgments which are always at the end subjective are necessary, is difficult.
It is the correct time for Bopara climb up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
That resembles can be asked maybe also in one further field, whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee should be conveyed, both intelligent young managers with good ends that know the business well.
Who can say what the correct class is for a cricketer, unless, the possibility to swim or to sink is given to him.
As a matter of course numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances also have this.
Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain to the correct time, if it can take a Wicket and a brawler must get regular chances on the order if it wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer.
To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many which were better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, who will play seemingly in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares itself as healthy and bowls as the wind into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but they both had their highlights and hope for still more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya Stadium can be only an opinion question.
The choice could decide on the careers of both men, or nevertheless maybe it does little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul Collingwood to consolidate then still fightingly around himself that created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and that, although it scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, maybe still is underestimated.
Probable is, that Graveney, Vaughan and bog, after a further discussion in the course of the present net meeting in the Asgiriya Stadium will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feeling for Shahs greater experience above Boparas youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Debüt-Innings into Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara that is younger with 22 years seven years, and an excellent balance against rolling turned on.
But Shah did Indies only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west in the test in lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate refusal of the selectors as Vaughan healthy was in order to take back his position for the next game it seems to have taken the swing that was still manifest in Bombay from his beating.
In Contrast the all-rounder has shovel-wise high spirits from Essex.
It is not impressed from anything on a cricket place and was brought his attitude off on the point, than he had estimated a vehicle with four wheel drive recently in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the First that he did was his Vodafone (natural also gesponsort) to get out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance, and to say his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance with enthusiasm: "You saw that"?.
Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls his central speed with some effect here on the grounds, what it seems to match to it and beats with confidence and fate.
To elect the correct man is a thing, to choose the correct time another.
Maybe that is the actual art of the selection.
I bend for this purpose his chance to give to Bopara now, what does not mean that nevertheless maybe Shah will not stand good if, suggested as the tea sentence from Ceylon, he is that one that will play here this weekend.
Buses return fugitives to the work - and in order to fightAl-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi fugitives from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of marketed ones whose resources or Visas ran out, and other ones who hoped for the city to normality returning.
Some had even come back around the rebels combat, that had marketed it from their houses.
At the bus station Mansour, still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen of penalties, that one was active to Terminal with fugitives from Syria and Jordan that had returned in private transportation.
"I decided on going to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad", Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunnitischer doctor, said.
"I came today back, because of what I saw on televison and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and as it would be now secure."
You say that the Mahdi-army stopped killing people", he said, with respect to the Schiitenmilizen of the militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr who ordered to put his strengths to the present time back.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year old schiitischer teacher from the predominant one sunnitische part of Amariyah, with his two children turned, because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqi to work.
His schiitischen neighbors in Amariyah appealed to him in order to say to him that a militia local, supported by the USA helped to drive out Al-Qaida of their bastion in the west of the capital, and insisted it for the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a sunnitischen and schiitischen tribe who had been driven out of his house by an attack with grenades in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad after who having been called his fellow citizens for the abatement Al-Qaidas.
He was to come back in order to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and said to me, that they began one the Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That is why I returned today", Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many told, that they had been attracted through the increasing rest in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizen", which one arms and defend their quarters in collaboration with the American military.
However more spoke of that, to have been forced home through visa problems and versiegender resources in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqis had fled in the last years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year old three times father, expressed to force the general suspicion among the Exilanten that Nouri al-Maliki, the schiitische Prime Minister, had requested of the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions for the fugitives, around people for the return.
More than two and a half millions of people fled presumably from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We were fine until al-Maliki Syria visited and" it said "the government was urgent not to give the Iraqis any visas more in order to force her for the return into Iraq" the sunnitischen pensioners'.
"I can not trust a government that supports the criminals, that my house burned down, after I went away."
A part of the reason for the drop of the power is that Sunniten were driven out of schiitischen residential areas, where tensions decreased, and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places.

Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is during the professional training carrying on and shines even with the international direction of his colleges.
Only in an education field the same deficit presses the Saarlanders as the rest of the country.
"I have'declared to a non-Saarlander yesterday for the 50th time, that we are not French - this slogan plakatiert the smallest federal state selfironic to his 50th birthday".
In this case France and Luxembourg play a big role in the education system of the Saarland which lies in the education monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne (IW) on place five.
So the colleges co-operate already from tradition withthe neighbor countries closely.
The university in Saarbrücken was set up in 1948 of the French.
Until today studying keep up their study here one double or three compartment diploma close.
The part is correspondingly high foreign Studying with 15,6 percent.
However Saarland brings also the subjects onto the colleges in number above average - many of them without an end at the grammar school.
"In Saarland one uses the professional education system", Axel Plünnecke, education expert, says at the IW.
More than every fifth young person gains his study authorization at a vocational school, Saarland lies in this way more than seven percent points above the federal average.
Also the possible combinations of professional and academic training are comparably strongly built up.
The equipment with dual courses of studies is measured by the population number the second-best one in Germany.
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand the number of the engineer graduates in the last years, however, around a third sank.
For that the Saar education ministry obliged the colleges to a marketing campaign now for engineer-scientific compartments.
"At the general education schools we initiated according to the first Pisa-study many reforms", a speaker of the education ministry says.
So the government introduced national benchmark tests.
In this way the children to begin formerly to learn is the last Kita year free of charge - a model that meanwhile also other federal states copy.
First future comparison studies will show whether the services of the pupils improve lastingly.
Near Pisa 2003 the part of the risk pupils of 29 on 20 percent shrank.
In total Saarland did not increase itself as strongly, however, as other federal states did.
The Bavarians calculate better.
And for the annoyance of the Saarlanders Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured near Pisa - in this field one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is duty at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez rearranges the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks tick soon differently than in therest of the world.
On 9th December president Hugo Chávez makes turn down the chronometers in the South American country around half an hour.
Meanwhile in Spain Chávez becomes the joke figure.
As the gazette of Venezuela informed, the clocks are set according to a new law for the world time minus four and a half hours.
In this way the südamerikansiche state gets a time zone which there is not in any other country of the world.
The USA-hostile Chávez justified his decision among other things with the United States of the world having imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
Furthermore Chávez canceled the breaking off of the relationships to the Colombia neighbor country announcedly on Wednesday (Local time) because of a hostage affair.
The link nationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe Präsident of Colombia stays, he will not maintain relationships either to the head of state or to the Colombian government.
"I can that already only because of my dignity not", Chávez that drives forward a constitution reform which the citizens of the oil country must vote on on Sunday in a referendum said.
With the reform he would build up his power clearly inthe country.
Trigger of the quarrel was the decision Uribes to extract the mandate from Chávez for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia in the case of which it was a question of the release from hostages.
Uribe spat Venezuela with his decision into the face, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain Munde is Chávez in all of it.
A new mobile ring clay guarantees in the country for sensation: The sentence which already more than half a million of people downloaded to themselves from the Internet says "Por qué no te callas" (why you do not keep quiet).
Spain's king Juan Carlos who was irritated by the continuous heckling of the link populist on the recent Iberoamerika-peak and had gone to this over the mouth spoke it.
Deutschen threatens 2007 wage minuses
In spite of the strong economic situation a real wage loss threatens according to German employees of a prediction this year.
Experts named a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler-donation the employees could really reckon in 2007 less on the salary account than in the previous year.
The modest wage development, the value added tax increase and the price pushes with foods and energy are guilty at that, Gustav Horn of the institute said for macroeconomics and business research of the "picture"-newspaper.
New loads could come up also with the unemployment insurance to employees.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the "Neuen Osnabrücker newspaper", the planned drawdown of the unemployment insurance on 3,3 percent to the change of year is correct indeed and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the federal agency must not come for work to have to ask for credits or subsidies with the Federal Government again in embarrassment, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it had become known that the price explosion drove the inflation rate onto the highest state with foods and mineral oil products since 13 years.
The prices increased in total around 3,0 percent in the year comparison.
Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is more similarly than up to now thought in spite of their life-hostile atmosphere of the earth: The European space probe "Venus Express" has flashes in the atmosphere and wind whirl at the poles discovers how they occur in the winter also on the earth.
Since almost three decades scientists presume that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" produced the proof - she traced electro-magnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: The flashes on the Venus fire in a height from cloud to cloud of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California tells in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theorie" flashes made the life arise on the earth: Thunderstorms are supposed to have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the education from amino acids the elements of the life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there were ever lives over there, it must have been in the very early history", Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution declares in Washington.
Today there might hardly be on the surface of the Venus something live: The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on the earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is maybe the devil twin of the earth, but she is a twin", Russel said.
Why the Venus is, the the earth in mass and size so similar, a so entirely different development has struck, the Esa-Mission is the basic question.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-research since since beginning of the nineties no probe anymore was especially on the way for the exploration of this planet.
The newest research results, that "are imagined" now in several "Nature"-Artikeln, do not underline in the view of the researchers only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.
"You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbor planet with the earth are greater than first of all accepted" the Esa informs.
The researchers found like this also a cloud whirlpool next to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably more quickly.
The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere, a team of researchers writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-innermost planet of the solar system has the almost same mass as the earth does and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet referred to also as a morning or evening star circles in just 225 days around the sun.
He turns itself much more slowly, however, around themselves: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees of centigrades and a pressure of 92 cash hardly reminds of the earth, scientists assume that both planets had arisen under very similar conditions.
On both water that remained on the earth on which Venus, however, got lost into the space in oceans was collected.
And while carbon dioxide is being fixed on the earth in carbonate rocks, it defines the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler defends Merkels meeting with the Dalai Lama
An end of the party quarrel demands Federal President Köhler around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor office.
Indirectly it criticized the SPD because of their attacks onto the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst coalfish worries around the renown of Germany and the great coalition asked to end the quarrel around the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present any fissured nation to the outside world in this question", Köhler said the commercial leaf.
At the same time Köhler signaled sense for the reception of the Dalai Lama through Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me even if I have respect for the difference of the cultures", Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must preserve sensitive balances in the foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, took, however, Merkel before the reproach in protection she practices a new China-politics.
"The Federal Chancellor did not refrain from the traditional one China-politics.
Also China knows that", Köhler said.
Foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had made indirectly annoyance be recognized about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked therefore from rows of the union.
Steinmeier had lamented among other things the "shop window politics" of the union in the foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the chancellor office it resulted in vehement irritations in the Sino-German relation.
So the Chinese leadership did not uninvite only the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but froze according to information of the MIRROR also the so-called Strategic dialog of the Department of State of both countries.
China's head of the government Wen Jiabao asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel now to admit the reception of the Dalai Lamas as an error.
China refuses it if European politicians obtain the religious leader of the Tibetans in official function, confirmed Who Jiabao the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he attempts to split off Tibet and the further Tibetan region which contains also other present provinces from China.
Schäuble warns against riots as in France
Cars burning street battles with the police, shots: Wolfgang Schäuble warns before riots as in France.
It must be done everything so that social dissatisfaction does not vent itself in Germany in power on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters fired with shotguns onto the police: After the hard youth riots in France Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must pay attention to also with us social explosive not being built up and unloading in power.
We must "accept" that, he said to the "New press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young human being manages the fast change of the social reality.
Federal Government, countries and communes worked already on reducing problems with emphasis, Schäuble said.
That does not affect only the integration of migrants.
"From the integration peak up to the Islam conference that shows alreadyfirst successes."
For all clear it is, however, too early.
Schäuble referred at the same time to there being not city-structural and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris young people had had in the last nights hard street battles with the police.
Also in Toulouse cars and public buildings burned.
Meanwhile the chairperson of the Turkish Municipality demanded greater integration efforts of the Federal Government in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Faced with the riots in France Kolat warned for "pastiche effects".
The situation in Germany is not indeed as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless action need withstands it, however.
Kolat referred to the unemployment rate being "in an above average way high" with young people with migration background under 25 years.
Particularly more training facilities must be guaranteed for.
Accentuated to Kolat: "We must give the youngpeople|adolescents a perspective."
The Chairperson of the Turkish Municipality added, however, in Germany more finds than in France "a social control in the families instead of".
Many young people with migration background did not want to destroy furthermore what their parents established here.
Kolat admonished: "But in spite of that we must look out."
One must give the young person "fast the possibility to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile it remained in the night to a large extent quiet in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel.
Groups of one hundred of the police were in action, a helicopter flew with floodlights over the field.
The responsible authorities announced three arrests as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before a mobilization of about 1000 security forcesguarantees for rest.
The police will reach through for so long as it is necessary, inside minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit in the suburb.
In the night on Tuesday about 80 policemen had been hurt in the case of riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the consequence care the riots extended to Toulouse.
The riots were inflamed at a road accident in the case of which on Sunday two young people had died.
According to first findings of the prosecution the police do not bear any fault at the death of the young people.
In the empire of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documents that the coalition is at the end with regard to the contents - and that nothing anymore is to be expected by her itself.
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live actually?
After their hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag that was wurschtig and contents-poor one must say: not here - not in the country that would have to be ruled over by it at last.
Angela Merkel with a badly arrogant sentence rejected the reproach that she concentrates on the foreign policy too very much.
That is provincial, she said and it showed in this way first what it is a question of for the critics that she does not want to understand.
In the Bundestag she documented for all in recognizable form, as very much their reproach applies.
There neither concrete interest nor a feeling at all was to be sensed for the problems in the country.
Instead of this Angela Wolke presented himself: a removed politician who flees into the foreign policy and stays even there in the rough one.
Example climate protection: There she praises itself unbrakedly for the decisions of saint dam, it does not say, however, how the climate objectives are supposed to be reached in these parts.
Anyway, the self praise - the CDU leader would have refrained from so much presumptuousness still two years ago.
Now she clings to the empty phrase, that the upswing arrives at the people.
In this way it damages their image as a Pragmatikerin who solves problems instead of talking the world beautifully.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke inside-political problems are an edge appearance.
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses for thatremaining.
It is characteristic in this case how she is often mistaken when it is a question of the children's allowance.
Merkel needs three runs there in order to bring out a to someextent straight sentence.
She stumbles as on foreign terrain if it becomesconcrete.
Department attack
In the Youtube debate of the republican premiership candidates the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney give a hard exchange - and must fear now a maverick candidate.
The strain of the candidates already with|in the caseof the first topic unloads.
It turned New York into a "haven for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney reproaches for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This counters for his part with hard reproaches: "I would say his own house was a harbor for illegal", Giuliani replies and flings to the former governor of Massachusetts, privately immigrant without having employed papers.
The candidates sound the attack: Because the republican basis does not keep on having any clear favorite, the eight premiership candidates use the debate particularly on CNN in order to discredit their adversaries.
The self turned 30-Sekunden-videos that internet users submitted via Youtube are not hardly more than keyword donors.
"With this kind of isolationism we made Hitler come onto the power", John McCain reproaches his opponent Ron Paul, that than only in the round an immediate withdrawal from Iraq demands.
Also Romney gets the Leviten readly strongly from the Vietnam-veteran when he the so called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method, with which it is simulated To Drown refuses to condemn as torture.
The reactions of the hall public show that meanwhile the important topics of the campaign, however, lie beyond Iraq war and torture debates in hr. Petersburg in Florida.
When always conservative values are praised and future tax increases refused, surges in the auditory applause on.
In this case more, where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie, showshimself once.
"I was mistaken then", Romney declares remorsefully and achieves apology before basis and TV public for that, that he still belonged to the abortion proponents in 1994.
Giuliani on the other hand comes into the rolling, than he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in a for the first time plain-clothes way
A day after his resignation as a head of the army the Pakistan ruler Musharraf was vereidigt as a president.
In this way eight years of military domination end in Pakistan.
Pakistan's president Pervez Musharraf was vereidigt on Thursday for a further five year long term of office.
The Pakistan television transferred the ceremony live in the president palace of the Islamabad capital.
Musharraf swore, the constitution to respect and to actfor the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he had handed over his office to his Trusted Ashfaq Kiyani as a head of the army and submitted in this way to international pressure in particular from the USA.
The former general controls eight years after his accession to power in an unbloody military coup d'etat now for the first time as a civilian head of state.
Musharraf had given his resignation as supreme command oat of the armed forces to a nuclear demand of the opposition and the west.
A further central demand is an end of the state of emergency which Musharraf had declared on 3rd November.
Already soon after his swearing Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum will cancel Musharraf the state of emergency aloud and give that to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum.
The Uppermost court of justice of the country, that Musharraf according to the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November had filled lawyer weighed with it, had rejected in the last week all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6th October.
Meanwhile five soldiers were killed to in the northern tribe region Nord-Waziristan with an assault on a military convoy and hurt four more.
According to information of an army speaker the bomb exploded on a street near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the cabbage skirt return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies plays music again: The three volume members of Harmonia planned their consoles once again at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival a monitoring appears from their large time"Live in 1974".
Already then it was abroad considerably more famous.
The arranged sensation happens then in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening board.
Everyone has his box in front of themselves,his cables and particularly his buttons.
Dieter Möbius thrones in the blossom-white shirt with 63 years inthe middle.
To the left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.
To the right, considered from the auditory, bends Hans-Joachim Rödelius, 73, concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a Beat.
And sometimes it matches by mistake to a traditionalpiece of music.
That seems not to disturb also the gentlemen themselves then in a largeway.
That the band Harmonia plays music again worried among cabbage skirt lovers for some excitement.
At what here may reveal: Purposeful demands did not show that the name buzzed indeed through the collective pop memory, however, by no means so lastingly in order to miss this band painfully since 32 years.
But why is also the German not supposed to be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the Siebziger years?
Especially as what is called Krautrock misleadingly was valid always more in England and America than in the own country.
When the music economy awarded the survivors of the group of Can 2003 of Cologne with the reverberation-price for the life's work, one looked in the hall into asking German pop faces.
As the Red Hot chili Peppers in the eulogy also still near the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanked, the amazement did not know any borders.
In the case of concerts Michael Rother sat later with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old pal.
The problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration abroad isone.
The memory is already therefore overtaxed because the trio existed only two years and unfolded also a far smaller effect power in this time than they subsequently were assigned to by other with Harmonia.
Möbius and Rödelius had played music already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name cluster promising a lot.
First of all one played in the cellar under the Berlinshow stage.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economical reasons for a plate label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped out shortly near power station and connecting oneself as a guitarist at Neu!, the then maybe most radical German group, a call erspielt.
Around 1973 Rother followed, however, the cluster-musicians into the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country.
There, in the Old Weser yard, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-fugitive Kommunarden.
Less ideological than in the commune I, where Rödelius was still allowed to take pains as a nurse.
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence.
Also a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein was found alleged in the bulky waste and for the art a name.
Some held Harmonia of that.
"Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe" was called thefirst album.
Because so calmly and modestly the music also rang, the band suffered from material need.
The brushwood compiling was not used only for the Selbstfindung.
The now appeared CD "Live in 1974" was logged at a concert in Griessem, before a just 50-headed record scenery, how anyone to remember believes.
The wish came of Rother then, Harmonia to force and to practice sometimes.
For Rödelius and Möbius an immoral demand.
The band explained in 1975 their separation.

Cluster was livened up in the eighties again and is since then more successful than it was Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Greenland record company set itself to maintain the cabbage skirt as an ureigenen German contribution to the live music the aim.
New! was dug up in this case already as Rödelius solowork.
The physical reactivation of Harmonia occurs in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.

Julian Cope is there, the Briton, old punk and author of the manual "Cabbage skirt sampler".
There also the Loveparade-inventor is Dr. Motte.
With what the entire bandwidth of the influences of the cabbage skirt on the following pop music would be outlined.
The vacancy of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia in this case.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall: "The only music preserves, the future belongs to it."
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in thefarmhouse room.
Projections of further black and white photos of confusedly wired rigs are used for the putting end education.
Before that the three veterans are dealt again with the improvisation.
No more, when they stick microphones to the organ and to the percussion in order to elicit incredible clays from the instruments about self made effect devices.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the Technical hollow Tüftler.
Also the choir of the house does not change anything atthat.
Under the management Barbara Morgensterns coughs under Soundwolken and whispered and at a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!" sung.
Krautrock was really always a very English concept.
It was a question never of Rock.
The roots were searched less in the blues, than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (Power station) or on the flight in front of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here "'68!" calls, does not have very improperly, and Harmonia can not be brought from that also now from the rest.
Still the most natural thing is reconsidered on the stage thoroughly.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
That can rob one of the nerves or give to fleeting moments of great luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous peace" two films deal again with Balkan War.
Nevertheless both do not convince.
To set the drafts either to a lot on Action and Geballer or however they are too sentimental.
There also Richard Gere can not help in "The Hunting Party".
The good information first: Indeed the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans, however, calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere was found now.
We had last lost the most beautiful man of the octogenarian years from the eyes because far too many nice-irrelevant roles cured one of the pleasure into feeling well motion-picture work for women and far too many press conferences on the topic Buddhism on seeing.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting party - When the hunter to the Is Hunted (why film titles must be today actually always so long and confused as train driver wage agreements must?) nevertheless maybe to look.
It supplies a representation eye-winking wonderfully: Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become from Gere if the fate and the film branch were not so merciful: A man who has his very best times long behind himself, who, however, still preserved considerable residues of the former charm even as a ruin-same monument of his downfall.
But in spite of this trump "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murderous peace", that starts also in this week, only the endless row of failed Balkan War films.
With "Murderous peace" one can do short process: The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb from kosovarischen snipers, on which one falls with them in love promptly also still.
Although it is acclaimable, that here once not the Serbs as an only root of all evil are represented, the fernsehflache film disappears far too quickly in Geballer and Action.
A kind remains "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but for thatwith war.
On the other hand it can be investigated at "The Hunting Party" almost exemplarily why actually there has never yet been a correctly good Balkans war film.
The history of three US war reporters that prepare themselves in order to trace the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could have become maybe a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories resemble themselves really remarkably: To go both Male small teams into the forest, in order to achieve something, what the militaries not can and both Male it becomes a journey into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is, that one of Simon Hunt not simple the cynic come down with heart be lets, when that it us at the beginning is imagined.
No, the script must impute on top of that still a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him.
Finally "The Hunting Party" goes then the creek under that, if the reporters succeed in what Nato, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years did not create within the last five minutes in the quick-motion procedure: The war criminal catch and to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge leave.
That is so bad that one would like to call the International court of justice in The Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic.
In this case the film has a most deeply human request.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic run still freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to be by way of exception once agreed) not to practice the pursuit far too intensely due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meant one and the evil are sometimes so similar themselves that a famous Brecht-Gedicht comes to one into the sense.
In that it is called above the wooden mask of an Asiatic demon on the workbench of the poet: "I see the swollen forehead veins compassionate, pointing out: hard how being bad is".
Films as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such a swelling-head that, however, pointing out is as hard, good to be.
The problem is not restricted on the genre of the Balkan Warfilm.
Is recent in this newspaper tells become, that all Iraq films Hollywoods were big flops.
One can add: There has never also yet been a good South Africafilm.
Almost always is valid: If a star hangs around on the crisis-breeding elements or mine fields of the world, something like that comes in this case then from that as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all the conflicts are within a given time simply still toonear.
It had to pass by after all decades before to Hollywood with "Schindlers Liste" could shoot a good film about the holocaust.
Some film will presumably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" being regarded as classics now were not celebrated at that time really by any means as masterpieces unanimous.
But maybe we know today, where every mass murder in real time comes on now two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenplay writers of the Bedenkenlosigkeit who needs it in order to tell good histories.
"Existence or nonexistence" or Really finally became "the tall dictator" as well also therefore because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet as in fact badly the Nazi regime was there.
Maybe one must not want to be good if one wants to make goodfilms.
Maybe one must have the sarkastisch distanzierten artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
As that to parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and Balkan War was questioned, he answered: "That is due only to some things being never changed.
Cities will be always terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always there will be war in Yugoslavia."
From Beust criticism gathers for Olympic-refusal
The moving away of the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic Summer Games bumped with politics and economy onto vehement criticism.
Many keep on wanting to fight for the games at the water.
However from Beust realism sends a reminder with|in the caseof the assessment of the chances.
The main manager of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described on Wednesday a renunciation when "not good for the economic location".
No other project developed in recent time so great motivation strengths in the city as the Olympic idea did.
"Without this objective the sport-political swing could not be maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate "which takes a changed time ray as a basis" not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach for that.
Mayor Ole of Beust stayed on Wednesday with former statements according to which at least the Olympic aspirations of Hamburg are unrealistic up to the year 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides about an Olympic application, but the German Olympic" sport Federal Government", said from Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sport Federal Government about an application of Munich for the winter games 2018 expected for beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to now thought by us to 2028."
Nevertheless the dream is not for all time dream, said from Beust.
The Hamburg sport Federal Government (HSB) regrettedthe statements of Beusts.
The impression that Hamburg does not want to apply in the next 25 years anymore for Olympic Games is given by that.
It is too early to obstruct a chance when one the plans buried already to this time", HSB president of Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application stands furthermore contrary to the statement of the senate leader on the occasion of a reception to the plenary session of the General German College Port Association.
There from Beust the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 did not describe as substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The college port association had nominated as an applicant city only in the last week Hamburg.
The SPD citizens faction reproached the senate not to have used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg.
"The Development of the Small Grasbrooks was delayed by the senate for years because he put Olympia on the card and "ignored" the house building", the SPD-representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD was always demanding an integrated planning for the Kleinen Grasbrook for Olympia and a later living-use, the CDU put on one side on the "event-factor".
The Application for the Olympic Summer Games 2012 had activated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time.
Leipzig had defeated, however, Hamburg.
Those ones are not Warhols boxes
Who combines the concepts of Swedes and Holzkiste thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or nevertheless?
Currently dark shadows fling work list into wooden boxes produced to Swedes on Warhols.
A majority of the ninety-four there listed Brillo-boxes of the "type Stockholm" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper stirred up Expressen some months ago doubts about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of the year 1968, internal enquiries come in the Moderna Museet into Stockholm now for a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as donation are copies - and presumably also the majority of the about a hundred more Brillo boxes of the "Typ Stockholm" that are on the international art market in circulation.
The case history is encapsulated, a confusing concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964 Warhol got his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red-blau-weissen design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo", into New York.
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo-boxes - with Warhols consent - of cardboard: These did not come (from Kostengründen) from Warhol, but they were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill.
It was a question not of works of art, but of their models, around bare exhibits.
Simultaneously Warhol gave in 1968 presumably the permission to make of a few Brillo wooden boxes which, however, were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet be produced in Sweden.
Time witnesses speak now of about fifteen boxes which then shrank as authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the denomination "Typ Stockholm" to right into the art and auction history.
Some of them achieved more than 100 000 dollars on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén claimed later by mistake, it is in 1968 produced about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden that Warhol left to him then and exhibited.
In fact Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmoe for an exhibition in hr. Petersburg.
To this time Warhol was already three years dead.
Lars Bystroem, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, examined next to that one six museum-own Brillo-Boxes also three from Swedish private property, of which two 1968 in Stockholm were made: Your pressboard plates were primed first and ground off, after that white oil paint with a paintbrush was put on.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 on the other hand betrays that the color with a painter role without undercoat was applied directly to the pressboard plate - in addition it is not a question around Oil-, but around acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes by the official list", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve lets announce: "When the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication' comes board' in New York not to another end, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copy/exhibition material.
Already in July certainly the Authentication Board announced to follow the "difficult accusations" that are raised as regards the soap powder boxes.
However, since then one wraps oneself in relentless silence there.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
On the Philippines rebelling soldiers who had entrenched themselves behind a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall from president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo gave up.
He can not account for any bloodshed, the chief Antonio Trillanes who reproached the president for corruption and choice fraud said to reporters in the hotel.
Government-Loyal Soldiers had stormed the hotel before by tear gas application.
The about two dutzend soldiers had entrenched themselves since hours behind the building.
About half of them protruded on Thursday because of a failed coup d'etat attempt in the year 2003 court - among them Trillanes.
It used the negotiations in order to drop oneself off suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
Apparently the military policemen who should guard it actually had overflowed to it and followed his mutiny.
You penetrated the Peninsula-hotel and demanded the fall from president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops shut off the district around the distinguishedhotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of thesecurity cabinet.
The national security consultant Norberto Gonzales condemned the procedure of the soldiers.
"The people have enough", Trillanes said.
"We appeal to the people to follow us."
General Danilo Lim who formerly commanded over the elite unit of the Scout Rangers said other army-units wanted to follow the march shortly.
Government critics had called for Friday for great demonstrations against the president.
Your government is overshadowed since months of corruption reproaches.
Manila's finance district was in already 2003 main scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The revolt failed after just 24 hours because of the refusal of the army to connect oneself.
Since 1986 there were already at least seven coup d'etat attempts against democratically elected governments on the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet safeguarded itself a part of more than 20 percent at the Telekommunikationsunternehmen Versatel.
The average per stock is 14,46 euros, as the enterprise at the Wednesday evening informed.
One holds now 20,05 percent of the capital stock.
A takeover had been speculated on before.
One leaves the option open, still to increase the part ontoVersatel.
With the step one wants to drive forward the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet informed.
Before guesses about an entrance had already arisen on Wednesday after the Berenberg Bank increased their participation in the Düsseldorf network carrier to 15,1 percent around further 5 percent.
The money house holds the parts only for a third party, it was said at the financial market.
United Internet already with just 10 percent had participated in the day before at the mobile radio enterprise Drillisch.
Within the framework of a capital increase Drillisch of 17,4 million new stocks seated to the value of 106,4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5,15 million stocks of that for 31,4 million euros.
Furthermore the enterprises recorded conversations about Vermarktungskooperationen for DSL- and mobile radio products.
"We strengthen our partnership", an United-internet-speakerexplained.
The two enterprises based the joint venture MSP in order to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being the two enterprises with a part want to zufriedengeben themselves of good ten percent at Freenet and not to make any use of their right to take over further 18,49 percent at Freenet, divided United Internet on Thursday with.
The two enterprises left all options open, however, it meant to keep on increasing also the participation in the Freenet AG in particular.
Conversations between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership were in the middle of November ended.
The constant since months and only still hardly transparent poker around Freenet part of the consolidation of the German Telekom market is.
Freenet had 2,9 million mobile radio contract customers and 1,27 million DSL- and complete connection customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held 6,01 percent of the Freenet-parts up to now directly.
Now it was arranged that Drillisch brings in further about fourpercent.
The right to buy the 18,49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already in August been agreed.
