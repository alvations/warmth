The American legislators should after words of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as quickly as possible to return to the negotiating table and the draft for a support of the financial system. 
Otherwise, would face that other countries would be affected by the crash. 
A bloodbath of American stock 
The US House of Representatives has on Monday the plan for a support of the financial system rejected, for up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion Kč) should be implemented. 
The legislator ignored the request by President George Bush, to support the plan. 
Bush's view of the fundamental causes of the plan to regulate the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy. 
The American stock enjoyed on Monday a bloodbath, and the main stock indexes made the biggest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar collapse had he least in 1987. 
The index was already down before the vote, but there was little sign that the proposal would not pass in the House of Commons, went through the index in a free fall. 
Congress makes concession: US government is $700 billion in banks pumps 
The leader of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have on a broader form of an agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system agreed. 
Is to be voted on at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators achieved in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the American financial system for a total of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion kronor) a breakthrough. 
However, this means no victory. 
The Congress must negotiate a few details of the agreement before the final version of the bill must publish and vote on it. 
The plan to support of the financial system is in the American Congress on Monday. 
On Sunday, said that the chairman of the Committee on banking and financial services Barney Frank of the Reuters news agency. 
In the Senate could probably different, until at least Wednesday to vote on the plan. 
Economists should, according to a statement that the plan adopted the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets. 
Then, however, it come to a "sobering" on the complex mechanisms, such as the markets in practice could help. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have a significant step forward. 
We have our different views clarified, as a package to stabilize the market should be like, "said the agency Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
You said that it could still come to a final vote on Sunday. 
Representatives of the legislator in the night of Sunday with the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, together, the government fund to give its final form. 
This provides for a unsellable buying mortgage assets of the finance companies in which the financial firms are plunging in heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and on the market must also be effective. 
We must continue the recovery plan further, but I think we are on target, "Paulson. 
A signal for Asia business 
The global financial crisis is also shown clearly in the stock markets, the sharp fall. 
The words of the democratic senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, according to the legislator, before Sunday in Congress to a final agreement. 
This is the dark investors to participate in the Asian financial markets, put lie in the first time zone, where a decision of Congress could influence the business on Monday. 
So far, but is not yet clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, there is also uncertainty about whether the negotiations in the last minute, but still not a problem could fail. 
The lawmakers hope that it will be adopted in the next few days. 
The law but will know a few changes. 
The aid for the system certain total amount should be divided into two parts. 
The initial $350 billion as quickly as possible should be released, as President George Bush called for. 
The Congress can block the payment of the remaining money, if he has the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, and that with a further $100 billion, and later the final 350 billion dollars. 
Bush takes a positive progress in negotiations 
The President has in this decision a veto, however, the Congress can vote its veto. 
Despite these changes, however, is the basic idea of the programme are gone, the out was based, finance for the buying bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen to win because hundreds of thousands of Americans are in no position to repay their mortgages. 
"We have everything all. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday, "the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
Satisfied with the progress has also been the American President Bush. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with the progress on Saturday and "like the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and our economy to protect". 
Golden Fallschirme restriction 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, stated that the legislator would have a responsibility for the Money Programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan agreed. 
The new law is also the sog. golden Fallschirme limit for directors of the companies, which are involved in the programme, and puts a committee, the supervision of the fund should be. 
This is to the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard and a major progress towards an agreement is reached, the work, and for the market and for all Americans is important," Paulson. 
The plan also adds with a aid for homeowners, the problems with the repayment of their mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates of mortgages it buys, with the objective of the monthly cost for the debtor to lower and enabling them to keep their homes. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The proposed plan is after the Hauptökonomen from Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, but the implementation will be very difficult. 
"And the reason for this is that we do not know by what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets are bought. 
This will be crucial, as the financial sector and the government of the losses divide between themselves, "said Marek this week the server iHNed.cz. 
Whether the plan now or at the beginning of next week to be passed Mareks view is not definitive. 
"It is much more important that the Congress to agree to the plan to support and that they adopt him as quickly as possible. 
The psychological importance of the agreement that an adoption, in this moment is the most important thing, "said Marek. 
Duel on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advise you in your election 
While nearly every mobile phone MP3-Dateien, moreover, may not yet telephone MP3 player. 
Therefore it is, of course, is that it is better to buy a phone only. 
Despite this, there is plenty of reasons why we should get a stand-alone player. 
The election is of the type of use and the demands of the future owner. 
Certainly we buy it at home for a splendid expensive Plattenspieler to put out the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc to hear. 
Even such musical new features to appear not LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this. 
Have you LPs, however, with the kind of rock, jazz or Blues in the shelf, it is likely that you dream of at least one of them. 
It is also with the music on travel, with condensed music - music in a simple MP3-Format. 
Here, too, there are price and quality categories. 
For a perhaps it is not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kronor, but also to a Pink-Floyd-Fan headphones for twenty kronor from the market. 
Two extremes, between which it enough room for everyone. 
The selection is widespread. 
The life of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good music player for much more than just music, moreover, but what mobile phones, they do not even create an indication. 
No modern equipment are as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phone calls and the Simsen, may reflect music and videos, both, it has a better, sometimes a worse photo apparatus and can also perhaps way. 
And if you still the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, it was almost a small computer in the bag. 
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can souvenir Grillen and no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will, however, need to shop. 
And the playing of music is one of the largest Energiefresser. 
Only a few mobile phones can music for longer than 10 12 hours are commonplace, mostly it is much less. 
In this respect, are Music player (especially the simplest) much more efficient. 
This is why you must count on the cheap mobile phones so that they do not longer than a few hours of music are commonplace. 
If you then to telephone and yet, you prefer to buy the safety a loading gear for office - and this applies to more expensive equipment. 
In MP3 players, you may not have this problem, even the less good consider at least 9 hours of operation with a time of loading. 
Another problem is, if it is the music on the mobile phone überspielen wants. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, is also not every mobile phone without specific software directly to a PC. 
Of course, the music can be directly to a storage medium überspielen, but only a few cards reading equipment will be without reduction with the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
In the players need you to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need only on the machine USB-Port with music from your PC to feed. 
The majority of mobile phones and even player a music library, in an orderly fashion after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the tree structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, similar to the Windows Explorer, certain people are both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to operate, more mobile phones can 
In the selection of a specific piece of equipment you should, especially after the lifespan of Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, the Bedienkomfort back. 
You have music scene in particular and hear it every day, for example, only briefly in the trams, then enough any mobile phone to MP3-Dateien developments. 
What really can almost every mobile phone. 
They must not even particularly control what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can process. 
MP3 all create, and most of the music that you get, will be particularly in this format. 
The format is one of the most widespread, and most of the equipment also music WMA-Format shrouded in. 
Less customary is AAC (a format that Apple and its i-pods use). 
Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of music online. 
We need only on the side of a mobile Internet Providers (or of another supplier to call), and you can buy a song or album. 
This is a service that is already in itself be a sufficiently convincing argument for why we should get a music phone. 
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad, and usually only limited on rapid Radiohits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
Generally expected but that it is just this sort of selling music (be it on GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future, the music industry will dominate. 
The mobile phone bear the most. 
If you have the inclination, to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the with them, while the player at home is forgotten. 
It is, however, whether you always, or at least a wireless headphones Freisprecheinrichtung in themselves. 
If not, you can rely on the integrated loudspeakers, on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player. 
Probably the greatest benefit of the music mobile phones for many in the price. 
Usually the cheapest cost less than three thousand kronor. 
For three and four thousand kronor will get you a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap for the majority will be that no normal headphones. 
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphones cost of up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The advantage of the player is the light. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really each service. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the restaurant with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the Plattenspieler is obvious. 
There is no collision in the form of a mistaken salaried mobile Internet and then a horrendous bill for data transfers. 
The equipment should now be resort 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) are generally a slot for exchange at storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.). 
Even if you a card to buy, rich two thousand kronor. 
But respect. 
In the basic models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. 
8-GB-Speicherkarten only the most expensive can also read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and still buy a cheap MP3 player, then you are following Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, or iriver Emgeton. 
According to the capacity (Max. 2 GB) then you must not more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
You belong to the more demanding listeners, take you dear specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and Bedienkomfort is so to the of an individual MP3-Players. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones from the series Walkman the same user interface as individually MP3 players sold. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long Akku-Lebensdauer (usually 15 hours, a maximum of up to 35 hours) make you MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers. 
The first virtual providers are already in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps it 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite fully developed, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they also by its partners in Western Europe are offered. 
Nevertheless, is missing something here - a virtual providers, the conventional forces to lower prices. 
Perhaps this is not be long in coming. 
The Czech mobile telephone providers to the most expensive in Europe in the first place to work, as we have often on Mobil.cz reported. 
It also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, the attention made that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in terms of regulation of roaming charges is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. 
So how is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe so high? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition, which really a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, but there are three mobile networks and a Penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone operators to go against the fact that it in the Czech market is very much competition. 
The does often also the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, which in the past has often said that no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. 
It is likely that a classic providers with their own network no longer has very many opportunities (incidentally, he probably would hardly any frequencies. 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual providers in the mobile market expressed a clear price reduction, on the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. 
But was it before the entry of such firms such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
But it has shown that there is room for such providers and that this really can succeed. 
Incidentally, you need not long after examples to seek. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual provider mobile King reported in Poland. 
In just half a year, this providers, more than 100 thousand customers to win and so on the five biggest supplier of the country standing. 
Behind mobile King is the financial group Penta, in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: Fon has. 
The advantage of virtual providers is that it on a much more specific target group can focus. 
In order to be able to be efficient, virtual providers need much less customers as a classic providers. 
They need not a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world as the virtual providers themselves as normally Low-Cost-Firmen - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, however, often by a less extensive service. 
So, for example, offers Tesco in the UK Mobile SMS by at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of mobile King in Poland shows that it can also be a very good move on a not klischeehafte target group. 
This providers is specifically aimed at men. 
"Real Kerle choose mobile King - the provider, they like it and they can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company of this virtual provider. 
It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland and in the Czech Republic could take root. 
Doubt the press secretary of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is for a segment of the market, in the most virtual providers are based, relatively small. 
He is also from the point of view of the services offer relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic chancenlos, my mobile phone providers 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators segment of the Czech Republic, this does not mobile King will be. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations are not particularly hope. 
It is rather to a market of mobile King in other countries are our region, "says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesman for the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly, confirmed it so that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic that ideas are not particularly favor. 
On the contrary, they are trying to ensure that not a potential competitor. 
Their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider for some time already shows the group GTS Novera who wish to take a further step, a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of wholesale to be. 
"We have a great interest in our customers do not only fixed, but also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen offer. 
And the sooner, the better. 
This is the opportunity we have repeatedly with all the Czech mobile providers negotiated. 
With some of them already, we were able to achieve progress in negotiations, "the press spokesman for the group Kaidl Pavel. 
Perhaps now come better times. 
Is not official information reveals that the first virtual providers perhaps to be expected by the end of the year. 
So far, but this is of an insurmountable wall of silence surrounded. 
"At the moment we are not assuming that in the Czech Republic for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market compared to other markets has great specifics on. 
So far, we still has no subject with a complex and serious project in this area mentioned ", says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
On the specific nature of the Czech market point further providers. 
The press by German operator T-Mobile presenting its spokeswoman Martina Kemrová bows in rare agreement with the statement by O2 added: "So far, we have not yet a viable and mutually albeit found on which one could build on." 
And it added: "In the network of German operator T-Mobile presenting its by the end of the year is hardly a virtual providers. 
In this moment we should already have a concrete offer, in order to be able to think in the short term. " 
Vodafone direct its attention more to meet the requirements of the own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers are we open, particularly in the field of division of costs and infrastructure. 
We look at it from the point of view of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand 
The actions of the mobile telephone providers is easy to understand another providers would be more competition, that would lead to a fall in prices and also lead to a decline in profits. 
Why, then, should be such a competitors from entering the market facilitate? 
That the providers can pull together, if something is also fined the long commuting the emergence of U: Fon. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction ČTÚ was at time when U: Fon came on the market, of the German operator T-Mobile presenting its society. 
The show also the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. 
But now is precisely U: Fon as a reason why we should not allow a virtual providers. 
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been entering the market and a fourth mobile provider strengthened. 
In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is clear that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services high standards. " 
In view of this approach of the mobile phone operators, however, surprised the absolute indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ in Czech, unlike Britain and other developed countries - not the competence has, to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is exclusively the office for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This but was this whole problem to his very typical attitude. 
"The market of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after it to a contract between a mobile phone providers and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
So far, no such contract was concluded, because the supply of potential stakeholders for the traditional operators was probably not enough interesting, "in his response to our question Kristián Chalupa by the department of external relations ÚOHS. 
By representatives of the providers would not be surprising. 
By one authority, the consumer interests represented and, among other things, to ensure that no one misused his position in the market, this is more a matter of concern. 
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work quite normal, is entering the market at a price reduction in mobile telephone services has helped." 
But are probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price cut to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
It is truly shocking in this case, the almost touching line of the three mobile phone providers, from their reactions. 
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the absolutely same petrol price of petrol stations certainly only coincidence, the consequence of the tough competition. 
"The authority has no evidence discovered in this matter, at a point against the competition act along, and therefore has no reason in some way to intervene in the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he has not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. 
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile phone market for virtual providers also probably lack the regulatory authority for telecommunications, led Chalupa in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points. 
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drafted by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile telephone providers a dominant position. 
But some legal experts have a different point of view, for access to the market of a virtual provider is always the approval of the network operator. 
And the mobile phone providers - logically has - for its network the monopoly. 
The means that he, in a certain segment necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if we were not able but with this argument, it for the ÚOHS should at least be a warning that three mobile phone operators are remarkably similar. 
This show complaints of a number of interested parties (including the above society GTS Novera) that it in negotiations with all providers in very similar difficulties. 
Buck-passing ČTÚ is on the in the telecommunications services quite a common ploy, with the ÚOHS of the whole matter. 
This was so in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately it is possible in the recent revision of the telecommunications law passed the enlargement of the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in the telecommunications, although a number of experts from promised an improvement of the situation. 
This is the representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It is, if no one watching 
First unappreciated remains the functioning of any pseudovirtueller providers, which in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are firms that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services are spending, but only partly open to the public. 
It is normally by firms in the area Multilevel-Marketing act. 
Their own mobile telephone services offer Amway, for example, Bohemia Telecom, Star life and others. 
The price lists of these firms usually only selected to come. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm to the operators as a classical firms customer occurs, of a large amount of SIM cards. 
As an important client receives he then specific price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers a similar resale ban. 
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a violation of the contractual conditions, which we are working, which brought an end to cooperation with the relevant society can bring," said Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem. 
However, it is unlikely that something in the leaders of the mobile phone operators gets around not. 
Particularly in the case of the three listed firms can it be thousands of customers. 
No operator, however, opposes such a move. 
From the activity of these companies that they are not negligible gains, at the same time, be it - unlike the real virtual suppliers - not by the real official marketing. 
To possible problems Miroslav Čepický: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services of these firms, only a very small percentage of customers used. 
This must also accept that the SIM-Karte in their telephone not on their behalf, so they may not have fully about how the normal customer of the mobile phone providers. " 
That alone but should the ČTÚ at least strange deposits. 
It also opens up a further question for the ÚOHS. 
Close the mobile telephone providers from such an approach, why they are against a virtual providers? 
It is to add that the ÚOHS to uncover such activities have very strong powers, and if it does not want to, it must not with the declaration of the providers, they knew nothing and their business conditions would this ban, satisfied. 
When the Czech Republic is not the most expensive 
As the text has already been pointed out on several occasions, the market brought a sharp price drop virtual providers in the various services. 
Bearing in virtually all countries, where virtual providers are created, the traditional providers tried to the emergence of practically more or less to prevent. 
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - is too small, or too much gesättigter market, problems with the quality of the services, etc. 
In the advanced countries but just stepped in these times, the regulatory bodies, the far from the interests of the mobile telephone providers, but tried to maintain their customers. 
Is it by formal or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operators, and this was followed by further. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies raise to the whole case like a hot potato. 
On the basis of our experience, we can not get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competence in these cases is more than favourable. 
But we do not throw the Flinte. 
If the background information is correct and soon a virtual providers emerge, the Czech mobile market may soon to move again. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, is allowing the ÚOHS will remain inactive when it comes to reject (to discriminate against other interested parties). 
And finally, the Czechs are no longer telephone more expensive than the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Find you the best from 
You hear the four versions of the new Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek was on the occasion of the day of the Czech statehood in a ceremony the new footage of the national anthem Where is my own country.

The processing of the anthems versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček. 
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to equal all four versions. 
For the Czech national song Bělohlávek is one of the most beautiful anthems. 
Before he had the Czech radio said that he voted for the singer Solo-Varianten with young, representative voices selected, the considerable and popular. 
"From the outset I have also in two and then with the chorus is trying to comply with a clear aim, so that the text goes well, so that a line is emerging," the conductor of the orchestra. 
The Czech national anthem is celebrating its 175 next year. Anniversary. 
The song Kde domov můj -- in 1834, for the first time on the stage of the guild theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, music emanating from František Škroup. 
It was popular, and the people took it spontaneously. 
The first of the song Strophe was then after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 to an organic part of the national anthem. 
One of the seven state symbols it remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic. 
Sounds the "new" anthem

"In the trains, the Prague integrated transport, have the Zugbegleiter reading equipment with which they the validity of coupons and zone after time to examine," said Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid the ticket control. This organisation puts the timetables for the Prague transport companies together. 
The Vorstadtbusse have card readers in the coffers of the drivers. 
In boarding the chip card must not only led to the driver, but the Open Card is in a marker at the side of the cash set aside. 
So the driver controlled the validity of the coupons aufgespielten.

The Sudeten demanded a referendum by the United States 
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 had the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States is asking. 
This is clear from a letter, the in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library stored. 
If we do not part of Germany and Austria can be, we at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to be some groups of Sudeten Germans in 1945 to US President. 
It is, among other things, read from a letter, in a private archives have been and the today is in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library will be kept. 
The Germans Krumau ask the letter of the American President, he should ask for the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler - was adopted in Czechoslovakia would not allow. 
"We have the situation correctly understood the words and we really want to be sure that the American units not oppressors and enemies into German territory, but as liberators," it is said in a letter, with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten dear" is signed. 
Since the end of Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten Germans in knowledge of the Czech National character - might suggest that they brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect, ask the author of the letter the American President, for today and for ever on the protection rule Böhmerwald. 
"We cannot believe that you without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area for us grant a foreign state, the minorities oppressed and tried to remove and nothing has contributed to the victory of the allies," is in the letter to read. 
The reason why the author did not sign, is supposedly the fear Rachegelüsten "Czech oppressors." 
If the US President doubts about the affiliation of Böhmerwalddeutschen have, whether it be sufficient, if he in the Böhmerwaldgau would initiate a referendum on whether the inhabitants of part of the United States or rule under the protection of the United States wanted to live. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the post-war history may sound a little naive, but he has some witness to a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least guessed that it on their removal from the Republic would negotiate, just a few of them such an opportunity. 
Some waited that the United States and Britain for the Sudeten a kind of autonomy would negotiate. 
Still others believed that they could simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The confirmed the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, from Budweis comes. 
He has been in the war as Budweiser German in the navy in the Baltic Sea. 
As he at the end of the war in British captivity and it came in a prisoner of war camp after Holstein said, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, he should teach them Czech. 
"They believed that when they come home, they would be the Czech to Pass," Chalupa. 
No one of the German prisoners of war, before the war in Czechoslovakia had lived, projected in his view, with him on the basis of the Beneš Decrees from the Republic would drive. 
You not heard - then pay! 
An emotional campaign is to motorists. 
Most expensive action to safety on the roads in the Czech history. 
So would characterize the emotional media campaign, which the Department of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday. 
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises that drivers of dangerous behavior behind the wheel turning. 
The campaign for 150 million kronor TV, radio, the cinema, on the Internet, but also on Flyern running. 
It is to the drivers of alcohol and driving too quickly, standing on tax. 
And it is also important to remind themselves from journey anzugurten broke. 
The campaign wants to especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers talking into the conscience. 
And what is in the Spots shown? 
Above all, stories of people who appeal to emotions. 
It also shows the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign. 
You not heard - then pay! 
The words "not heard" in large letters on a plate shield. 
And in a Blutlache is the word "am paying." 
This should mean that you a moment mistake with the own life can pay. 
The Spots be viewers by 2010 schocken. " 
The Ministry of similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries inspire, where you quite normal images with dramatic footage of accident victims can see. 
It is the assumption that the accident figures and the number of deaths on the Czech road down. 
The Spots were euro RSCG compiled by the agency. 
The carrot and stick approach for the motorists 
"For the driver is the motto carrot and stick. 
Carrot means that if they, for example, in red drive, save time. 
The stick is the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán. 
And this is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising necessary, does the psychologist. 
Are less effective in his view, tables, the drivers on a threat. 
"Is it a static table on which a danger warns, this probably will soon with the environment verfließen, and the driver, they will no longer take", says Kořán. 
Olmert would almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace to return 
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has for the return of virtually all areas, the 1967 were, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if you in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria could close. 
It said it in an interview, which on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot was printed. 
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary, nearly all (occupied) areas to return, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper. 
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will be to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) must resign because it without that there will be no peace," he added. 
He acknowledged that a possible return of East Jerusalem will also cover. 
"The person who wants to security in Jerusalem and, above all, do not want tractors and bulldozers roll on his feet, as it happens is one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people are killed and dozens of people were injured. 
After words of the Prime Minister, will it be necessary, a "special solution to the temple, Berne and sacred and historical sites" to find that on the territory of the Old City. 
"He who the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city, maintain wants, will include 270.000 Arabs. 
It will not work, "he confirmed. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert spoke for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights from what it considers a condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria. 
This would also some effort on the part of Damascus demands. 
"My proposal is not, with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights peace to close," Olmert said. 
"The Syrians know only too well what they must do to recover the Golan Heights. 
They are on their current relationship with Iran must give up; they are on their relationship with the (Shiite) movement Hizbollah must give up; they will have to give up on the constant support, the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq to give, "the Prime Minister is helpful. 
Questions after the accident, are in the bus Stewards unlawful? 
The law does not know it, in a Fernreisebus is not permitted to run around the 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of society student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua raises the question of whether Stewards and travellers during the journey, and Daisy back on the bus. 
"We wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, as is the work of a Stewards in breach of the law on the road," the spokesman for the Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week, the death of a young Stewardess, was probably caused by the drivers of lorries, the path of the bus kreuzte. 
The young woman sat in this moment, in addition to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although they still had two more seats available. 
A bus will but also in the moment have an accident or slow sharply in which the Steward coffee or newspapers austrägt. 
Also plays a role, whether the bus after the vehicle letter with Stehplätzen. 
If this is not provided for in the bus, the travellers are sitting. 
The long-distance coaches of student Agency have no Stehplätze; what is the director of the firm Radim Jančura, towards Aktuálně.cz confirmed. 
"We have discussed with the ministry, and it has first by the movement of passengers not approved. 
Later this has changed and we have come to a consensus that the passengers during the journey must go to the toilet, if they have their seats, "he shared with his position. 
The law knows no Steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role. 
However, there is no law that prohibits the carriers, services to provide. 
The law on road transport knows only the concept car companions; its rights and obligations but not defined, "the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka is clear. 
The director of the department road vehicles of the Transportation Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law this problem afterwards. 
"It is a question of whether the bus in the product approval Stehplätze has also. 
This is then everything, "he said. 
Buses are divided between city buses, where it Stehplätze and where the speed limit is limited, transport buses with Stehplätzen and a higher permitted speed and distance coaches without Stehplätze with the highest permissible speed and seats that are equipped with safety belts. 
As in the plane, says the professional 
The BESIP-Fachmann for traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín sees in the movement of Stewards on board a bus not essential. 
"With a liquid driving will not threaten many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board a plane. 
Here, too, is not sure when turbulence, and the Stewardess can. " 
"Slow, however, a bus, then, of course, also apply the laws of physics. 
Just as in the Stadtbus or in a tram. 
The safety of Stewards must clarify the carrier by internal rules, "says he and also says that this issue from the point of view of the law will not be fully resolved. 
Jančura is prepared, the services to remove 
Student Agency offers the only Busfirma services of Stewards. 
The company employs some 200 people in this role. 
The director does their professional even after the accident, not as risikoträchtig. 
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of Stewards risikoträchtig, I will remove it. 
Coffee and newspapers can the travellers in boarding. 
This would also reduce the costs, "he says. 
As interest in the safety justifying the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, the absence of Stewards in his buses. Its society but is only a fraction of lines in comparison with student Agency. 
"We have no hostesses, we are reacting against us from the outset. 
Sooner or later it ends with some fatal accident, "he had not quite a year for Týden.cz said. 
It was an incredible tragedy 
The accident involving a bus lines to Naples was a young Stewardess Pilsen draw from the region, the two years for the company had worked. 
The Slovenian lorry was probably without the hard shoulder blinken abgebogen and had blocked the bus journey. 
The driver of the bus tried to sidestep through a penetrating manoeuvres, subsequently collided with the right front, however, with the lorry. 
That the two seats have been sold for the Stewards are Jančura disputes. 
"In these places can not be reserved, they are blocked." 
Drivers firm wants to sue. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman is the agency not on the court judgement a financial damages but it also expected on the part of the blame. 
A change in the law? 
Not in view 
A more detailed regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal system, in which a team of the Transport Ministry dreißigköpfiges experts already working on a year. 
"This is, however, no specific conclusion. 
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones in the travel, "expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transport considers the work of the Stewards not as something that the safety of passengers could threaten substantially," Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the employment protection authorities. 
In Frankfurt Düsseldorfer hopes 
In big words lack in the letter of the WestLB-Vorstands to the staff of the House. 
By a coming together of the Institute Düsseldorfer money with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank "could the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", it says in the letter on Monday reported. 
The advertisers by WestLB, a "competence block" with sustainable profitability in such a business. 
And could such a link of the decisive impetus to further Bündelungen banking sector in the country. 
So reads it, if a board of ability to act in a difficult time to demonstrate. 
The wounded by WestLB, still is under tremendous pressure. 
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for securities regulator, which the government nordrhein-westfälischen country recently has made it clear that the time is pushing, a future solution to be found. 
Of a sort of link between the Deka-Bank, the savings bank customers for their investment funds are aware, and the by WestLB, however, is for some time - the speech at Frankfurt side. 
Although it has Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas in the presentation of the half-yearly figures to the end of August, in a merger of the House to the Mainzer highway with a country bank Helaba or by WestLB, for example, see it would make no sense. 
But has the Board of the Deka, the half from each of the country, banks and building societies were going associations, the Board mandated, with the by WestLB talks on joint business activities. 
This could it that capital market business or parts of them go. 
The talks are, however, as stated in the financial centre, has only just begun. 
Of the Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 members of the more important employers at the City of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech when it for consolidation in the sector is building societies. 
In 2003, it looked for a moment as from, as if the Deka-Bank with the country bank Helaba Rhineland-Palatinate and merge. 
From this tripartite federal was, however. 
Hardly the plans were publicly become, said the government Hessische country against a participation of Helaba out from. 
The other two houses were not next to each other. 
The country Bank Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the country Bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But has it again on a combination of ideas Deka-Bank with land banks. 
Recently, however, had Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, against plan games on a combination with his home. 
Regardless of the verdict but seems to mature that a together the various houses of the public sector is suffering. 
After the Land election in Bavaria is over, could the first a combination of bank BayernLB with the country näherrücken Baden-Württemberg. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
Should the pressure to further mergers rise, going to get the partner for it. 
In the south would be they become junior partner, although so far the financial crisis has experienced far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A combination with the West LB, in turn, has the Sparkassen- Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen and, with 85 percent of the Helaba, is the beginning of the year, put a stop to it. 
Would remain if anything, the North LB. 
Such geostrategic considerations are but only one side. 
On the other there is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses to each other. 
In June expressed Merl, the key issue facing the business model is the future ability of the country to ensure banks should be by the Germans Sparkassen- Giroverband and so far not been answered. 
In the end, could also be a cutting of the West LB, which, of course, there is not wanted. 
So is in the letter of the local board of directors, the talk, it will in any case a "global solution" to the House. 
As with the combination of individual units with the Deka-Bank together can bring, will still show. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is "as the Italians weekend" 
For Elena is the first, for Luca for the third or fourth time. 
But this time Elena as his girlfriend, and so everything was different, he says. 
Behind them, in the case of the brand Fünf-Liter-Bierfass Emperor, is built a heavily bearded and proves the approximately 200 Oktoberfest-Reisenden how deep tones his throat can produce. 
Luca Elena is only a slap, then a Kuss. 
From Bologna, they are to Verona. 
From here, the Busparkplatz alongside the railway station Puorta Nuova, start to this evening at 11.45 p.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco festa della birra", expected to arrive 6.00 a.m.. 
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in a bus travel exclusively Brazilians. 
In a corner of the park grounds singing the South Americans in addition to its flag, they have already celebrated in the night. 
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, which is not something for Italians. 
Marco, a long coat Pelzimitatfutter and with a lens with broad silbernen bars – though, are the buses. 
For five years, they travel in October, there are three swing in this year alone. 
At night, in the daytime Wiesn by 10.30 p.m. back. 
Survival would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco. 
75 euro costs the journey, with Kaiser-Bier Willkommensumtrunk, brewed in keeping with the Bavarian purity, health insurance and the German travel management - Marco has visited a in Frankfurt Sprachkursus - including. 
And the buses roll in the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero." 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Soon it will be calm in the bus travellers sleep. 
A good thing, they will still need their forces. 
In Brixen and is kept in wooden churches, where a number of other buses with Italian markings on the motorway 8 just before Munich again to take a break. 
Finally, according to plan, when Marcos group at half past seven o'clock in the morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese is already up to 50 other buses from across Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the other pool, Marco considers a last address, said the plan of attack. 
Firstly, the yellow Käppchen put on. 
Out left "October firmly" in fracture, alongside the Internet address of Marcos travel office: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it." 
Secondly: "If the doors to the Bierzelt work, means there are," Marco calls in the morning. 
"Go!" Run and the number of seats in the back of the Zelts fill. 
"Not scratch, otherwise block we, and not all on the same shoals Gelbmützen, distributed in the area." 
The measure, brüllt Marco, costs 8,25 euro. 
Sailor and not forget. 
"The security people show that we are behaving well! 
As soon as their the places verlasst, they are away! " 
Thirdly: "This evening half point 11 again arrive here!" Understood? 
And there are things to Wiesn. 
On his way binds a yellow introduced as milestones of the trees, plates and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party. 
We want to be fit for the withdrawal. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende, as "Italians weekend." 
Accurate data on figures do not exist; there is talk of 50 000 based on the way across the Alpine and in the beer tents think that 10% of all visitors to this weekend came from Italy. 
The Munich police through seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross which is leading a Nations statistics in the Italians before British (approximately 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with some 200 medical Versorgungen the first place. 
Particularly popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt. 
Sleepless nights for creditors Hypo Real Estate for 
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only in the past week. 
As a good thing that the politicians, the word "relatively" and also used einflocht that the German banking sector of the crises will not spared. 
Because the is now at the weekend. 
The Dax stock exchanges in Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) by a consortium of German banks receives a billion credit, the continued turmoil in the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday, the credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion. 
The Hypo Real Estate should only the part of an interest rate denominated, they also take in. 
The money come from both private and public banks. 
Background are losses in the subsidiary Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had, according to a newspaper report for long deadline projects, for which he gave money has extremely refinanced in the short term - and because of the lack of confidence in the markets is no longer possible. 
In the first half of 2008 was the Barreserve about 95 per cent of the bank 2,37 million decreased, also had the equity capital from 1.6 to 1,45 percent given in. 
The current returns and the net proceeds from financial transactions were compared with the period last year to zero, the proceeds from Zuschreibungen to demands and certain securities, as well as from the breakup of reserves in the banking business by more than 70% to 5 million declined. 
Only thanks to higher revenues from refunds of downstream transfer costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa-Gruppe and from the reimbursement of interest rates after the tax and from the Geschäftsbesorgung for multinational companies, had the yield down with approximately 16 percent are still moderate. 
The former Staatsfinanzierer had itself after its privatisation in 1990 with commercial property loans verspekuliert, which will then Aareal Bank in the had been eliminated. 
Because we in the traditional state financing too little deserved had the Depfa then strengthened in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the state committed Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
The value of the daughter Hypo Real Estate must now make write-offs that a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group have to be hotly debated it quite vague. 
The fact is that the dividend was removed. 
For 2007 was it has been reduced by two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is since the Depfa-Übernahme a significant Heads of State and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. 
It is more than other institutions of the refinancing in the interbank market, because they have no client no. 
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks largely again dried up, because the banks are hoarding their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs per year for a part - around 50 billion - of the credit portfolio by Depfa short-term funds to refinancing. 
After communication from the Hypo Real Estate, is the financial needs of the group, with the credit for the foreseeable future and covered the company "from the influence of the currently operates largely powerless international money markets. 
From other sources is to hear that thanks to the money the refinancing by the end of 2009 is guaranteed. 
The HRE-Vorstandsvorsitzende Georg Funke said that against the Hypo Real Estate Group that the money markets will not be, for the foreseeable future claim. 
Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for securities regulator (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed. 
That is for shareholders and creditors of Bank to hope. 
But given the dynamism and uncertainties of the crisis there are no certainty. 
It is not unthinkable that the funding not fully must be hijacked. 
But the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
Since late on Sunday evening, I understand that the bank before the insolvency, was also capable of the at least temporary rescue passions not to reassure. 
The stock price breaks by 75% to EUR 3,30 a. 
Legal stand against the bonds rates. 
Last the priority debts show barely moved, the rates of Nachrang-Anleihen clear after. 
Particularly affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably, on beyond 2009 periods of time. 
Seem Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen former a speculative investment alternative, stipulating them after the sharp tightening of the banking crisis and of the Institute itself, with the adoption of the Depfa the crisis only being brought into the house had, as of the stability of the international financial system dependent. 
As long as the central banks, governments and less depressed commercial banks to support the system are prepared, as long as a punctually eradication of pensions are based. 
Or it enters the virtually currently dares to hope - that the financial crisis in the next 15 months will be overcome. 
But in view of the partial nationalisation on firm reports is likely to safety from the adjacent currently only become a legitimate hope. 
This is especially long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision, whether they are separated from their commitment. 
Short-term investors can use a line at a loss lecture for the future payment tax payments on course profits to form later years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the Tachibana High School to present, catching the girl to kichern: The Germans is totally "kawaii"! 
What this means? 
Sylvana knows the word from Mangas - in the new Austausch-Log tells them from Japan. 
"The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
I had even before the Schulweg Bammel. 
I live on the edge ’ s towards Kawasaki and drive around 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I was not proceeded. 
The starting class seems Tachibana not as strict as laid down at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils from 8 p.m. takes a until about twenty nine a brief meeting round with the teacher begins, the 'home' room. 
But, before the teaching began, I was in the series, pleased to present. 
However, I am not the type who likes to talk to people, even from a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I still had no Schuluniform, I have an old rock of my host mother attracted, blouse, blue knees assets and black leather shoes. 
In this lift I have put before the bench and tried to make things right: "Sayonara where she Sylvana... '- I welcome Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in a week. 
At the moment, I was very glad that I have a little over two years beginning, had to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have all getuschelt, sniggering gewunken and constantly, and I have the word "Kawaii". 
The knew I have from my Mangas. 
It is of vital importance to vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute and sweet '. 
Then I am quickly to my seat gehuscht. 
The girl beside me took a very broad gegrinst, they thought it was an honour that the Austauschschülerin sitting next to her. 
The rest of the day was relatively quiet, but as the chorus of Gong, I was almost bombarded overflowing. 
All were kicherten muddle and asked me and holes in the stomach - is it real hard to understand Japanese English. 
In the break packten then all their Bentos. 
My host mother had also made me as a Lunchbox - that is something other than the tedious German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in Tofumantel. 
Mostly I have no glimmer of bland, what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
Things to see strange from and unparalleled taste. 
The fact is that everything is real lecker. 
Well, until the plum salzig lodged perhaps, brrrr. 
The Bentos in Japanese schools are not only simply lunch. 
It is sometimes before that a girl a boys Bento pays a plate of itself, which they particularly skilful herrichtet - in the hope that the boys in the Pausensnack closer to experience. 
That I have in my Manga-Comics read. 
Sometimes, I am interested to see if I can watch it here. 
'Why it is Japan?', I have asked my friends, when I told them that I for one year in Tokyo wants to go to school. 
I have always said: 
"Because it fascinated me now." 
Finally, I read for years Mangas prefer. 
And I the comics and the culture is better understand that at some point, I have also begun to learn a bit remained in Japanese. 
For me was therefore absolutely clear that I had to be here at some point. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, customs and practices. 
And the places we great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. " 
Even rats have feelings 
A rat Schabe in danger or a flight, does that mean that you also feel fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced that a lot of animals have feelings. 
Just as you might check whether they feel the same, if they like we conduct? 
In the Internet magazine "Edge" for several years of contributions famous scientists published. 
Mirror online message in a series of selected answers to the question, "What do you think for true, without it prove to be?" 
I believe that animals feelings and other awareness conditions without that I, or anyone else, that is what could prove where we are not even can provide evidence that other human consciousness. 
But in this case, can we at least hope, because all human brains are the same Grundkonfiguration. 
As soon as we do, however, turn to other species and issues of the sense of consciousness or generally make entering we impassable terrain, because the hardware disagree. 
If a rat is in danger, is doing the same thing as many other animals: It is dead, retreats or attacks. 
People behave similarly, from which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience. 
Not, however, I think. 
Two aspects of the brain structure makes it difficult, our subjective experience on the of animals. 
On the one hand, close the almost always associated with human consciousness circuits the roadside prefrontal cortex a (because of its participation in the short memory and the Ausführungs- / management functions). 
This broad region is in human developed much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems to be lacking entirely on other befits creatures. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and to decide, so there is reason to believe that the man even different from the other primates. 
Another dramatic nature is in the linguistic nature of the people: Because such a large part of his Erlebens associated with language, it often means the awareness of oversupply. 
In this case, could rule out animals. 
But even if awareness not by language had depended, it certainly influence, animal awareness, as it may be, like, probably very of the majority of our Bewusstseins-zustände differences. 
It is therefore difficult to measure how awareness in other animals may be. 
If it is, and as something meeting Subjektives, either measure, because of the specific hardware, using our own experience can analyse, his research into major problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, the scientific might be more easily accessible. 
It could be the awareness processes of animals without regard to investigate their content, and that is what is happening in studies on the short memory of primates, particularly in the case of the Visualisierung. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed up, we moved more on the neural Korrelate awareness than on the causal mechanism: They may or may not be identical. 
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex, to reach the Visualisierung. 
What is for the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotive system like the fear in one of his own activity conscious brain activated. 
What we as a "fear", is the mental state in which we are, if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defense system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
As seen sentiments are closely tied to the regions of the cortex, the primates, and in particular the people. 
Associated with the linguistic natural result fine escalation of the sense of, because we, with the help of the words and grammar conditions can differentiate and categorise them alongside other due to ourselves. 
On the other hand, says Antonio Damasio that sentiments from more low � level of activity in the body and of the feeling areas of the cortex Hirnstammes emerge Jaak Pankseep similar, but increasingly focused on the brain stem. 
As this network in the course of human evolution have not changed very, very definitely species could be included on feelings. 
In theory, I could not, however, think it for unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues that in rats and people like fear appear, probably also felt in both cases, as in: But how could you check whether rats and people feel the same, if they behave in the same way? 
A Schabe at risk of flight, whether they also fear is? 
In my view, can mere Verhaltensähnlichkeit equality show no experience. 
It helps the neurale comparison: Rats and people have similar brain tribes, not even a brain Schaben against. 
But is the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
And even if we could prove the for the people: As we used to prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
And because their feelings probably differ radically from our own (as the human consciousness on specific Schaltkreisen and language is based), the emotional behaviour erforsche I rather than the emotional feelings of rats. 
In any case, peddling progress here on the neural level, if we in rats and people the same measures. 
As I language and sensitivity erforsche in rats, not sentiments, I do not know whether they exist. 
It may be that for short-sighted, but I come forward rather than constantly to run up against a brick wall. 
I am a practical Emotionalist.

Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein's not quite true could be. 
The spacecraft went almost 18 years flew "Ulysses" by the space. 
Because soon gefrierenden fuel pipelines now threatening the die of cold. 
Among scientists for years, a ensure mysteriöses phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by is a manoeuvres of Raumsonden, during which they gravitating additional momentum in a blue body, around the world. 
By the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The Euro-American Forschungssonde Cassini-Huygens used these physical ploy as well as the Ulysses Sonnensonde. 
What the researchers have for years, but surprises: The aircraft do not behave perfectly suited to be like it after the ancient Gravitationsgesetz expected. 
Rather, it is to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly speed up or slow down. 
So far, the physicist this effect could not explain. 
They tauften Swing-by-Anomalie him. 
Some experts fear that may even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, the attraction of matter by a curvature of the area describes, not quite true could be. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein erred not, and the Swing-by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter to explain the Astronomen identified in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which is also very near the planet could decide," he wrote. 
Of the existence of dark matter know the space researchers for only ten years ago. 
She is obviously an appeal, the effect on other blue body itself can be seen. 
They, on the other hand, is totally invisible, in other words, it sends out and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular is also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists makes the dark matter after all, well over a fifth of the whole of the mass of the universe.

The idea that the street Avalon Bay could buy, for the first time during the meeting made public in this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road while, it wants to it but not necessarily have. 
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is the pathway to renovate the dilapidated and at a public meeting point to make," she said, adding that the city of even the sale had proposed. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department for building protection said that it would indeed have been the desire of the city, the street to sell and stressed that the task of the unit is to develop the property rather than to administer. 
Compared with its colourful neighbourhood The Bowery, has an extra Place something of his historic impression maintained. 
Some believe that the street 1802 get their names in the years, as a great Farm, the Philip Minthorne, was divided between his numerous children and a close strip of land by any claims. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals, which in 2006 was opened up to the Extra Place and the road is certainly the most well known as a backdrop for the photo opportunity on the Cover of Albums "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the managers of the Ramones, of the photograph was made in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, shackles and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and Seilen. 
Some residents, the bloggers einschliesslich, the East Village on the Gentrifizierung write, have the idea of the sale of Extra Place rejected, with the argument that this public land, as modest as it is, should continue to remain publicly. 
Others have Extra Place as a rarity – virtually unchanged hailed a cluster of the city that should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, of the blog called "Jeremiahs verschwindendes New York" (untertitelt engages with "The Book of the complaints, a bitter nostalgischer view of the dying city"), has a part of the discussion of the city of history on Extra Place published, the magazine 'The New York "was published in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, was: "Extra Place is a small close impasse, even during the day and by dark verrostete metal door remains the warehouses, closed window and Regenrinnen over flying weeks old newspapers marked". 
With a few exceptions, the road has as recently appeared in one evening. 
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door, the sooner the CBGB led, where today is a more expensive clothing business. 
Graffiti on the walls were to see an empty beer bottle and was on the ground, not far from a fresh set of stuck newspapers. 
A few passers-by said that they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be improved somewhat. 
Fields, added that in his view, some people the lure of the road in its current state underestimated. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that the dark, damp and disgusting manner. 
Debate on bilingual education: Education in English language environment 
In this edition of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller, debate and lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and senior director in the specialist education sciences in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "is not as good as we think: Why is the middle class a Schulauswahl needs". 
To the Hispanic voters is a complex task. 
Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. 
Obama's campaign said, the "the likelihood afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic students in the school concluded successfully, is lower than in white pupils' - which is true. 
This achievement gap to close Obama's education plan recommends specifically from other a bilingual transition in the training for those who only learn English. 
Nevertheless, there is the question for Obama is whether his commitment to the bilingual education, the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, the gap in the Schulleistungen. 
Take this as an example of "" preparatory conference "Sixth Street", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently in the country are, learn English. 
Nevertheless, have amazing 100% in 2008 pupils of the fourth class the state math exam in on a good footing. 
Also surprising was 93 per cent of children from the fourth school in the English test evaluated as well. 
The astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those who preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street will make its focus to review and exercise at constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that no exceptions tolerated. 
In addition, the school is the approach that the training in an English-speaking environment. This is precisely the point that Obama should bear in mind, the Schulleiterin Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches importance to the almost ausschliesslichen use of the English language in the specialist teaching. 
Madam Mikels, the idea of bilingual education rejects it, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, who only came about from Mexico. 12 months later, the class room entering and it can no longer recognize. 
"It will work," she said, "it works for us". 
Would Obama a school as the "Sixth Street" preparatory conference "" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning pupils? 
The performance of the school would be the answer to this question easily, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support of the bilingual education make predictions on Obama's answer uncertain. 
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently the subject of trivialised by he said that people should stop concerned about the "only English" separatist legislation. 
Instead, he said: "They should ensure that your child is Spanish." 
If Obama really wants to close the achievement gap, should he carefully consider education models, the work, rather than to despise and to trivialize. 
The price of oil falls due to renewed fears about the economy 
The oil price is on Monday because of fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets may not be enough to revive the economy, sharply fallen. 
The crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange, trade in the Vormittagssession by 7% to $99.80 a barrel. 
Since last Monday is the price by more than $20 declined. 
In the last two weeks are the freight markets, both of the financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico has been shaken. 
After the price peak in July of $145.29 a barrel had achieved that, they are in this month to almost $90 a barrel, for, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets to rise. 
On Monday, investors concerned have once again shown, although Congress representatives had announced that they would have voted on the weekend agreement on a rescue plan, the largest in the history should be. 
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is still far from completed. 
For the time being in the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation buy. 
In the meantime, have the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments of the European Finanzkonzern company, partially nationalized. 
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, is it despite the tense negotiations, which took place at the weekend and have led to a rescue plan, apparently not succeeded in the mood of the markets to revive. 
As the economic situation worsened further, is to be expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall. 
Analysts of Deutsche Bank have wrote in a note to investors, the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates are become äusserst uncertain. 
We believe that you continue to write that the freight markets also will be affected. 
"From the perspective of the freight markets we are most concerned whether the US American virus spread throughout the world, especially after China." 
The analysts of the Bank have their expectations for oil consumption because of the weak economic growth for the coming year down corrected, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for the year 2009 reduced by 20%. 
The team record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he in the last eight and a half years more often than any other in the Jets-Trikot auflief. 
Then it found on Sunday, the second quarter, a result in which the jets gamble turned into a Triumphzug. 
"I have never seen anything yet," said Ellis. 
After a schlampigem game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, was the bad weather, began the second quarter. 
However, when Quarterback stone Favres passport in Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard-Touchdown arrived, marked the ideal prelude to an afternoon in which their burgeoning cooperation a giant step forward. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two Touchdowns that a times as a Aussenverteidiger ausrutschte and the other ten seconds before the end of the half. 
"I am not particularly hard," says Coles on the passes to Coles. 
"He is a super player. 
Our vote has voted, no matter what the people think. " 
While Favre and Coles trapping played, took the defence Quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis started from a stricken slam and turned it into a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to a different passport and it began. 
Linebacker David Bowen's then pushed for a loss of Warner. 
The last ball loss, forcing in Bowen's, was probably the verrückteste. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets won the ball back and Jay Feely captured a 20 Yard shot for the 34 to 0 leadership transformed. 
These were the most points ever by the jets in a quarter had made. 
When he was asked to describe the madness replied Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets' The second quarter or the third quarter? " 
To answer both, because the jets left in the third quarter to 21 points without a single to reach, Mangini said: "I think I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third. 
A lot of points have been achieved in a short space of time. " 
His world record Ausgeruhter Gebrselassie proposes 
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, has shown why him some of the best Langstreckenläufer of all time, after he in the Berlin marathon on Sunday has broken his own record and has become the first people, of the journey from 42,2 kilometres in less than 2 hours, 4 minutes has managed. 
With the victory in the flat rate in 2: 03: 59 has Gebrselassie his previous result of 2: 04: 26 at 27 seconds improved, which he had achieved last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has so that his 26 world record in his multifaceted career, in which he on every route from a kilometre marathon at least until a World Cup title and a world record is set. 
Last month Gebrselassie has left out of the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that the hindsight was too much, that the air pollution his asthma problems could worsen. 
Instead, it has registered for the race in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start, and 13 degrees Gebrselassie has - with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile won. 
Since then, Bahnläufer as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya on long-haul have changed, is the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 with the result in Berlin 2: 06: 05 won. 
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie has told the press that he had two weeks ago in his Wade Krämpfe had a week and could therefore not train. 
Obviously he is after recess eingerostet bring and not come back. 
"I am so happy," he said to reporters. 
"Everything is perfect gone. 
I have the training a week ago, and still had some concerns, but, in the end, all of which are super. " 
He was pilloried - particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - that he his Rennläufe overly orchestriert, many of the world's best marathon stars generally avoids, too much on the Rennanführer leaves, as if the race would be a train, and world records on the contest. 
But this criticism is damaging the size Gebrselassies as Langstreckenläufer. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie had the heart of the line in 1: 02: 04 achieved. 
Two Eliteläufer from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie courts have to continue after the Tempomacher had subsided. 
A little more than three miles in his last start Gebrselassie Finish has made to separate themselves from Kwambai, as a second in 2: 05: 36 arrived and this is his best time by almost 5 minutes of better. 
Kamathi was third parties in 2: 07: 48. 
Among women has Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and Germans, a remarkable year completed by with 2: 19: 19 of the siebtschnellste result of all time. 
The world record of 2: 15: 25 believes Paul Radcliff from Britain. 
In the last spring had the 36 years old Mikitenko surprising the London marathon in 2: 24: 14 won. 
She has missed the Games in Beijing, for problems that were described as a spinal injury. But it has recovered, in Berlin in order to gain and their best time in her third marathon at five minutes to improve. 
It has planned their course sent by a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan Läuferinnen ausreissen left only, but after 30 kilometres obsolete. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya as a third in 2: 25: 01 arrived. 
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of the special kind 
Hidden between the excesses of the leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glitzernden, noisy and gigantic activities, is a calm city in which the pride and the complications of the shadows afro-amerikanischen culture. 
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the city Hurstons Zora Neale, is no longer so easy to describe it as Hurston in 1935 did: "The city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers do end up drinking it, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Today, it is a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, had Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee are for the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville come at the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance to memory. 
And yet is and remains the city that it describes – and it into a tourist excursion goal made by them in the Florida travel leaders began, to periods of depression by the German writer project has been produced in many ways a place of particular variety. 
Eatonville is so independent, and private as sound overall in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities often refused in Florida, their true idea with the weissen man to share, "so little about us know that he does not know what escapes him." 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama to an open dialogue on race relations, there are still many here had to be monitored by Aussenseitern. 
"We are very anxious as our story is told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and community member of the oldest church in the city. 
It must vote. " 
Eatonville was for a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight defined. 
It is both an historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2.400 inhabitants, in the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
On the one hand it is a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes convicted, sometimes touted - black culture of the rural South, its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that people here both proud and on the hat. 
And so it began the concerns about Eatonville's image with Zora, as everyone Hurston call. 
It questioned the world their city, in books, which came from heart and in Mundart were written as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leaders modified the city, which is quite near the route 77, a street oft-vergessene centre by Florida leads to the scene of black history and human tragedy. 
Smart as Oskar, both in real life and in the literature, led to the shop Hurston reader of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned privateren affairs. 
"On the left side of the road," wrote it, "is the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and game seats, the always attended Howard Miller, although it hardly can read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks of any kind was-auch-immer and sold to hours rooms suits." 
In only a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville brought so with even government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a trip leader. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, which by all estimated. 
"Zora described it as they were," the 90 year-old Dinkins Ella, one of the Johnson-Mädchen the Hurston verewigte by the men quoted, the songs on their beauty sang, the full of sexual innuendo. 
She added: "Some people liked this not." 
We remember here Hurtson still as a lively Exzentrikerin, the regelmässig returned after their family after Jacksonville, Florida, was drawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, reminded that if Hurston gebraust came in the city, they usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, rauchend and with trousers, which even today in a city with its venerable clothing style einbildet. 
According to Mr Franklin were the majority of the inhabitants fascinated, whereas many of you despise. 
"The people were Zora always glad to see," said Mr Franklin. 
But "she was never too long," he added while he was in his chair schaukelte, on a terrace backfired situated on the Sabelia sea to look to the Hurston in all likelihood was baptised. 
As Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and their books produced enough. 
Along with the majority of the world Eatonville they seemed to have forgotten. 
Although they were once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin long Tin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920ern, was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eatonville there were no major commemoration ceremony, no public readings on a large scale. 
"I am not thinking that they their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of the 2003 Hurston was published. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the town, at the Kennedy Boulevard to replace the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs have already had the motorway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The proposal was introduced as Eatonville still of a difficult time recovering in its history. 
Forced integration, among other things, had the relatively idyllic isolation of the community a definite end. 
In the 1950s the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"In this time was often a bunch of white boys and throwing oranges and stuff on the people who sit on the sidelines," said Mr Franklin. 
"It was even once a woman the killing was. 
Throwing a Wassermelone from the car. " 
In 1955 Hurston behind asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the call of the Supreme Court, integration to force by its decision in the case against the Schulrat Brown as "offensive will my race respektierend" called. 
Today, residents say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positively in some respects, the groups in the cohesion Eatonville and self-assurance weakened its young people. 
"Black children were used to it, hugged to be - I remember hug, one of his teachers in the morning and his teachers hug on the evening," N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group for the protection of Eatonville Community. 
This could be maintained as long, they added, until teachers and pupils came more from the same place. 
"They embraced his white teachers do not, because he was a white teacher - I mean is a cultural divide in place," said Mrs Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have contributed to that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists who sat on prejudice, as they did with a positive self-esteem and statements such as: 'How can anyone deny the joy of my society! 
I understand it not. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker was on the way to Hurstons anonymous grave and began for the revival of their glory to fight. 
Five years later, was a much promised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway shelves in the books, and made them again to a part of the American Literaturkanons. 
The long-distance road project came exactly at a time in the most famous daughter Eatonvilles once again in the public eye. 
And this time Hurstons old neighbours saw it as Retterin. 
The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to demonstrate what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January sweep many for the ceremony. 
A few years later wrote the district of its road-building plans. 
"The plans of a five piecemeal highway crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with the top speed, set real citizens proud," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Madam Boyd put it somewhat simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the long-distance road project has to a change in the image of the city itself. 
There were more and more course travelled as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who since 1993 is here in the church, and residents began to appreciate the past. 
In 1998 Eatonville was in the nationwide historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (of course) opened after Hurston appointed in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today Eatonville is still a feature in Florida: Only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can they sometimes feel like a Hintergasse anfühlen in the summer of rain, as small as at that time as they of only 27 black families in the 1880ern was created. 
(It is today to 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are still often treated with caution. 
For most of the interviews is a approval in the run-up to necessary and certain things - as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest Church, which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the field work is - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fear that their abgeschirmte Community is misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time to the Hurston-Festival greater, was also a greater degree of home pride born. 
Young people in particular tend to see Hurston Eatonville as their entire race saw: Beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and just as proud, creative and hardworking, ridiculous and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America. 
It is the sincere love for this city of the people in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return after Eatonville, in the town of administrative or the police to work, which he could use a little help. 
And even younger people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville right. 
"Most people who only pass through here, will be thinking: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other," said the other day Alondra Kenon on Sunday after the church. 
"But if one really stop and for a moment in its history, it is a very nice city." 
Here in New York Finanzlatein one speaks fluent. 
At first glance, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan by the newspaper and the huge television screens in Times Square district thought, they would not even notice that they are in the midst of a debacle. 
It would never believe that on their heads, in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers that have the monopoly in New York, on a daily basis, the worst horror work day since the stock market crash of 1929. 
The suppliers are still with noisy Klappern Teewägen along the metal Bürgersteige and carrying Tabletts the with Muffins for breakfast meetings are loaded. 
Latin Americans still stumbling schlurfen between apartment, as human Pack animals loaded with about 50 gebügelten T-shirts, on an on their shoulders Joch-ähnlichen off the ground. 
People are still waiting to be placed on the increase people eat objects on their Frühstücksbagel and it is still impossible to a day between 16 and 19 p.m. a yellow taxi. 
It felt as a crisis at all until I Thursday afternoon because of all of the doomsday talk, decided to open a new savings account must provide identification. 
Although I decided my duty time was going on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribe subsidiary, already had about 20 people queue. 
Not to the Geldschaltern about money or paying off, but to the Kundenservice-Schalter where captive customers order cheque books, tourists after the department store Macy's ask and where new customer accounts open. 
Most before me, I later learned by Starr, my "personal bank employees with licence", were from the same reason as I queue. 
Unlike me, however, had already cut their savings of smaller banks, in places from where they pendelten, as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island. 
They had money from so-called Thrifts (a little one Bausparkasse ähnelnd), cooperative banks and those local savings banks, the only in a state branches have, aloof and say that they treat their customers like family. 
In the last year, 15 of these banks are quietly gone bust. 
In the last few days, Washington Mutual was, a bank with assets of $327 billion, bankrupt administration on and as a final Friday New York over the weekend driving home, was Wachovia, another bank savers in the value of $440 billion, in search of a grace buyers.

The exhibition, which the programme of the month of the photograph of the Flamenco heard, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, the day to day is getting bigger and bigger, is ", says the artists and makes it clear that" Flamenco-people' can be any old man, but when we look at the photos, the observer notes that there is no typical images of artists on the stage. 
Ordinary people on the portraits are artists, who are in a position on the stage passion, sadness, and joy, so that the audience. 
The personality of these artists to say, we must make no photographs on the stage. 
Their personality and her character is in their hearts. 
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me, with the photo camera the characters, the largest Flamencomeister canvas. 
Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', in 1997, on a long journey, with singer, dancers Gitaristen or photographed with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture sorting function of the camera and the existing material, pictures of classic photograph. 
The application of different stylistic means destroying the traditional basis of the picture, making the picture modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands awarded to be: 'Music with traditional roots, the changed and every day' surprise. 
These are not only of the dance, the singing or the Instrumentalspiel itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, his art with the audience blinds. 
The search for the essence, after some results, which, in the form of the Hörens, of being visible, and was the firm objective of this work in the next period in the gallery of the El Fotómata presented. 
Well-known personalities in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and other are among the close selection of almost 70 artists who have been photographed. 
The project has been a Anthologie of Flamencos and will soon as book, with all the portraits from the exhibition, appearing. 
Bauer ’ s passion to the portraits led him to this idea two years ago to take up again and as a 'portraits of the veterans of the sport' ('game to implement Project'). 
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are varied, gives the photographer to 'it like very much photographed people, they know to learn, and in their lives to enable state whether for a brief moment or a long time. 
I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult breed. 
Du triffst you or encountering people, people who sometimes do not even know, or they can leave you alone for a few minutes, a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas. ' 
The collection of portraits of the Flamencos today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is in the gallery of the El Fotómata issued in the street with the name la Calle de la Mata finds and parallel to the road la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can you to 16 October visit.

The novelist hispanoamerikanische acknowledged that it 'no way,', where we stand and where we know can measure whether books the life change, 'but I refuse to believe that the literature pure entertainment, a volatile experience is', stressed Vargas Llosa, who maintains that it causes' effects' and 'the people' brings more apart, so I asked the writers' not to abandon the ease 'and the' responsibility 'for his appeal' responsibility '.

José Luis Garci, a fan of the literature of Galdós, rest assured that, thanks to this Dreharbeit his' childhood dream 'in fulfilment. This has he esperanza Aguirre thanks to which it three years ago of the Autonomous Community of Madrid Supervisor, a Gedenkfilm to the second century ceremony in Madrid on 2 November to fix. In particular, because the story on the basis of' Episodios Nacionales' is based, was of the contract to. 
The total contribution of 15 million, of the Autonomous Community of Madrid was for Dreharbeiten, offers Garci, as he well, the 'unique opportunity' with the help of take appropriate clothing and the image of the 'bewildered Spain, which the wrong leader for the fight aussuchte, because the people in the fight for the independence and under the rule of the Ferdinands of VII behind was brought to portray'.

Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer), and the mother Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it is in the quarter Triana born and than it was three years old, is their family moved to London. 
It was a dancers and expert on oriental dances. 
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women to the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhistin, Vegetarierin and for the abolition of the corset, which limited the free female movement. 
The life of the woman who their mark in the Tanz- and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the period between the wars left behind, Isabel Bayón goodness. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and it has me this role proposed, and I thought impossible. ' 
"We are not trying to tell about their lives, to preserve their spirit," said the Flamencotänzerin. 
Their dance bases in Flamenco helped me a lot. 
"The dance of a butterfly ’ s wings' Guajira, for example, as I was before, or" of the dance of the snake 'as tango. 
Her dancing was sinnlich and I have been said that my dancing in this aesthetic area lies', claims it. 
The piece is relying on two exceptional work: With Miguel Poveda, again for Isabel in one of their ideas will sing, as he also in 'La Puerta abierta' has done; and with Flamenco-Meisterin Matilde Coral, together with the exception of their Ex-Schülerinnen wanted to work. 
"Matilde Tórtola plays a very mature personality. 
I am happy because it was, to help my work, and I am very honoured. ' 
The piece also expects with musical Komposition and Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, and the Viola of Rafa el Viola and cooperation with the comedian Juanfra Júarez, he 'will take over the role of the Begleiters of artists who were Divas, in which he still in love.' 
In this book tells you at a certain way by the life of the woman who so far in remote places like India, the United States or Russia, and of entire Europe was known, although they usually has lived in London. 
"I wanted to call it, because I think it is one of the women, the enormous influence on a certain era and whose works have today, and it is no longer even less value ', claims Bayón. 
The idea take place today at 20: 30 in the theatre Lope de Vega will. 
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién Casado' include Triennium a

The US can present without Paul Newman bad 
"Sometimes creates God perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of them. ' 
The phrase comes from the actress Sally field, the with him in 'Sensationsreporterin' worked, and by the prevailing idea of American cinema, which was in the lurch resident of America until Newman, with its generous idea home and followed. 
Show, what they cost to give him the Oscar. 
And when he withdrew in 2007. 
And he knew that he was very ill. 
Nevertheless, it was a major blow for all. 
"What sometimes feels, is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend, 'said Robert Redford weinend,' my life and my country were the biggest Drolligkeiten of his life. ' 
No one was afraid to make a fool of not to exaggerate. 
'Father' of the cinema and the country is in a sad moment, died in the fear of terrorists and before the market collapse in the Lower battered self-esteem of Americans on the desperate search for reasons, dignity back. 
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people who you can admire, we must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda, Paul Newman to love. 
For all he represented virtually a platonisches ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered losses as well as a number of both profits: From the Foundation, which is dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honour of his son from the first marriage, died of overdoses, was created to its own brand of internal and organic products. 
All of this is a gift for the country in which he ran into a lot of trouble, against a deadly food culture. 
A broad wave of surprise is high on Hollywood House without regard to nationality and citizenship. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winners, said that the work with Newman no more and no less than the tip of his career. 
Russell Crowe, the bad boy, who came from Australia, dared, Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"Us is the Größte of all of us leave ', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare try today to live like Paul Newman lived: High demands on the rectitude, a responsible private life, far away from the cameras. 
It is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle. 
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman was an example of this. 
He did leave a time and was subsequently fifty years with Joanne Woodward married, he was loyal, although it certainly many opportunities were it not to be. 
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street, if I have at home Filet?', he often scherzte itself. 
In the sky will he be proud that his daughters in the world in the same opinion as his fans have not necessarily in America. 
"Of all the major roles he played, no, he was as proud as on the of the loyal spouse, the loving father, the attentive Opas and of the philanthropists, ', they say. 
For the Olympic Games are the roads in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic disciplines in Madrid to stage, following the failure of 2012, there can be but perhaps 2016. 
But I ask myself, 'are we prepared for?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true! 
It has been described as the perfect streets, and in my opinion, then, it was the worst road with particular point of beating about, there was. 
Of course, it is a lot of nonsense, if you take into account the assessment would look at it and I would be so what clearly not accepted. 
But, we go by from the outset. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket to bring that allows you, as the first to go. 
It also seems to me to be a good thing, but if you do it right, then it should also give you everything (including chip, the congestion on the street to avoid). 
But not so. 
Here you let them just the ticket bring (the first nonsense which consists of only to go then) and (after an endless queues) as is the surprise, there were only the satirical t-shirt like the size of 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL) 
Where we live in fact? 
Or is it, then, that the next crisis became only small, much cheaper shirts from less substance to buy? 
Well, matters like these are a small matter compared to the days on the streets. 
Apart from the fact that we very early to go in order to get the chip, is already a queues of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, it must be the schoolbag. 
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, as in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, began in the streets and we had our Rücksäcke are not before, even if it was successful, but they call back would be more difficult. 
It also saw it, in those 40 minutes waiting period after rain from, so that it came to the temptation, a popular uprising to organise and to invade the Häuschen. 
I believe that morning will certainly have some 500 people of pneumonia and some as I be because this chip, which I, not even in time for the classification, I am thinking that the outcome was wrongly branded. 
Of course, if you ask me for a perfect street would, it would never occur to me. 
So, I believe we will still dream of a city for the Olympic Games is well prepared 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On the 'emerging Technology Conference', am there from MIT, Microsoft has the progress of the new picture detection system and Mensch-Interaktion presented, a system of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence, which is capable, however, to do some primitive tasks, such as a taxi order (or in the case of Microsoft is the one routes planners, on the campus of the company to move). The system observed what it during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a violation of form and face detection system, can this' Rezeptionistin 'see how many people in the area of who they are and even remember, as they were held, it can listen and the key words of their entertainment understand. 
It is also the present after the talks in the groups view. 
In the presentation video noticed Rezeptionistin ',' a third person, but she understands that this person to the group, with their conversation, is not, and that no company employee. 
They ask about whether the person who wants to come here and he replies that they will soon be listening. 
Everything without the blue Screenshot 
Very impressive 
This is certainly the future. 
Now the company has better things on which it can focus, for example, to the next version of its operating system Windows. 
This week we spoke very superficial on the change of strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be more quickly and not so many eingebundene programmes have. 
Steve Ballmer, established that if the computer would be equipped with the necessary, rather than with the commercial waste filling, so they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that is only for the few. 
Everything is just a statement, given that Microsoft Windows versions in one or other function well 'and' extras. 
The change of direction is worth 
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing in importance, just as the software. 
As a Google chromium appeared in the network, was the part of the theory that it was the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Thickly sent many indications that the Browser no operating system. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to ensure that hardware and software at the same time, can function. 
The operating system delivers the role with the operation of his wife or his or her husband can be compared when it comes to something to tell his mother-in-law. 
That is true. 
The system will never disappear, but it must be to its' death ', not as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth, thinking. 
What Ballmer, said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people pay less attention to every time the operating system, more the Web-Browser. 
The computer will be launched at the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium execute and every day we spend more time on surfing, than in the vicinity of the 'window'. 
What serves half in the computer of existing applications? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 is more compact, much more compact than vista. 
Light, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's is longer to integrate its online services, then, the alternative to Google. 
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I express a small example of this. 
The photograph of this place I have in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft, employees at the beginning of the month. 
On the Erfrischungsgetränkeautomat is fitted a shield: 'Your quest. Our future'. It prints a request from, own tool for Online-Suche to use it. 
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that the 66% of workers in Microsoft, Google for the research in the network used. 
Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in the delay is falling. 
They will not start, but at the end of 2009 are, even in 2010. 
Microsoft is seeking the possibility of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time to bring on the market. 
Turns every day the telephone in a computer. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso has it in Costa Azul angehabt, Leonardo di Caprio was in "Blood Diamond that mark 'of Edward Zwick, just as Al Pacino in' The godfather 'of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is built to clothing of a good pastor. 
If we start the countless Stars-Auftritte list, we can back on the image of a very strong man, with a sharp Bart, the in a travelling circus heavyweights increasing bureaucracy. 
The fact is, this is a typical satirical t-shirt like male from cotton, ärmellos and tailliert. 
'Tank' the English-speaking call it '. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands. 
Firstly, because of his great name, even though it in the close circle 'Marcel' is mentioned. The legend tells that the name emergence is connected with sport and Marcel Cerdan by the Boxer, the connoisseurs of the singer Edith Piaf, strain. 
'La Marcel' like all because of its excellent cotton, because of his differing Unisex-Schnittes and is marked by a small Belgian flag (hard to see), from which these T-shirts as a detail in the neck area. 
And respect, the Belgian firm focuses not only on the production of "tanks'. 
They also have college Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, cotton trousers, T-shirts with strips, babies, Mini shorts 
Convenient Modellierte and underwear. 
Even though, it is a great pity as under clothing to take advantage. 
They are very attractive. 
'I want to be a young mother; the candidate I am not worry about me? 
Their great presence with her sister, stopped it from their own personality to develop. 
Front Mónica Cruz is, but full of life satisfaction.

I am happy to be through a city and observing women as they are held, as they combine their clothes, I do so often. 
Dancers, actress and Modedesignerin, you are a very different women, is it not? 
I believe so, but finally, is everything in a and these areas have much in common. 
Since I was small, I was fascinated by the dress; I always wanted to go to my grandmother in the clothes limit my aunt herumzuwühlen and their clothes to see. 
It was super, almost better than in a leisure park to go. 
Even later, as dancers, I always tried to the clothing to respect. 
You know, do we dancers like it so much, our own style in teaching and to have the samples, to look into the mirror, feeling well. 
As an actress, if it gets the suit, put it in the real characters role. 
Finally, everything is linked, it is so much respect for the Kostümdesigner and their professionalism. 
Recently, are you 30 become, are you indulge in a crisis? 
Oh what. 
I feel better than ever, as I feel I thirty years. 
I think that the woman is ripe, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes. 
I have no fear for my biological clock. 
I have the terms of which I have since I was small, and I wanted to make this has been a great deal of internal pleasure. 
So, you heard from mother to be, or not? 
For a long time, and I know that I mother will, because the my body and I also wants to be a young mother; I do not escape me. 
What the candidate subject, because I do not worry about me. 
I will, my child great happiness feelings and it with a lot of love teaching. 
What the film art is concerned, behältst du in the eyes of the work, in which you have taken part and the last year were turned. 
As it is, and I would like to deeply that they will be presented to the public. 
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and unrest and do everything at once, which, of course, could not be immediately. 
I very much hope that 'La última Hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' lists for the first time. 
Time to see how they like you 
A few days ago, are you on the course rose appeared with Naomi Campbell, is this true? 
Is good, tell so what does not.

Naomi Campbell, which I know for some time, I was called and invited simply to London, for a march for the charity event of their organisation 'women for a better world "and the clothing that we are showing. I know that two garments from our Kollektion Mango were auctioned off for the money for Naomis NGOs to collect. 
The people know Naomis good heart.

Nevertheless, I will support this good thing, in which it is involved. 
She asked me to the parade for these großherzige up to participate, but if it comes and asks me a hand to draw level, I will do so. 
The women in the developing world to support what is also needed. 
The drivers because of the alcohol limit can be reoffending, be the 'Alcolock' must install. 
The authority of the instructions that the driver of the three official penalties because of the alcohol levels had installed in his car this system, which bans him, in the drunken state to start the car. If the influence he is, then, not in the car. 
The initiative was done last month announced in June and already a part of the report of the Attorney-General sheep. After their claims it is a Piloten-Projekt, which will take a year. 
The purpose is the recovery of the driver, so that a rate for the re-education of the transport behavior gets.

According to the statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who more than once because of the driving under influence of alcohol were appropriate, back in tax. 
The "alcolock ', that would prevent a system because it together with the car, it is the alcohol content in the ausgeatmeten air and prevented car start if the driver has made alcohol test; or if a alcohol concentration is discovered is the higher than allowed. 
It costs more than 1 000, the costs will be borne by the sanction imposed.

In Spain it is that 115 people a year could be saved lives. 
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: This behaviour in hand before it a criminal offence werd. 
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a reform can be achieved in the normal way, yet a reform of the constitution called for the for the prosecution process is necessary. 
Nor is the machine on the Spanish markets, available in any business, although it said in a number of commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport has been installed.

And if there are only a few, are all in a book, in which it is how to defuse. The book is reflected in the bookshops on 30 September. 
The Wecker is a punishment if he by 7 a.m. rings, but worse still is the idea that again in the flurry of rhythm, which requires the current life, purely. 
The office is, the tension and the computer, to the back pain. 
The stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there is not one, not two methods, the daily exhaustion and the problems, as one of the world of work abschaltet to fight. 
The number is rising but, no more and no less than to 1001. 
In addition to Yoga-Stellungen, the classic a massage or Spa-Behandlungen, Susannah Marriott in the book is the whole list of opportunities to the taste and time are each adapted.

Talk in the sleep 
Some children speak at night, 
I am not referring to those who wake up and tell us something, what happened the day before, but children during the course of the sleep, talk. 
If you do it for the first time, in the best case scenario would be shocked to see it, but in the real world has no importance. 
This is a positive sleep disorder, the speaking in their sleep. 
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people. 
Certainly, it was more than one of you told that her at night you have spoken. 
This phenomenon can occasionally occur (a time in life, such as during the high fever), or on a regular basis (every day, once per week, once a month), the next day the child can point to nothing. 
There is no reason to this phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena in the sleep explored, such as nightmares, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (Bettnässen at night), speaking in the sleep sought, but there is no reason to do so. 
As we have mentioned earlier, can it a very high Fiber, stress situations or asking too much. 
In any case, it is a little erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is very variable. 
It may be that if we talk in individual words, whispering in or it can be quite a opposite (cries, wines, long discussions). 
In the cases if the statement is very hard, it is recommended that the child to watch and a specialists to be advised to check whether a problem which is causing fear and in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disruption, is not dealt with it, whether it is linked with a different sleep disorder, which can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What we can do is a series of simple preventative measures to carry out. 
Try the child before the sleeping not to get. 
In other words, calm game for the child to choose and avoid stressige television programmes, the terrible and a little too wild. 
In the nervous children, which Entspannungen to recommend that relaxation methods can be used to help them, a certain Home rest. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If the freedom of speech in their sleep is once again trying to preserve the rest. 
To think that it for the child is harmless, and the next day it will not be able to recall what happens. 
Some useful advice 
Weck it not. 
This is useless, because the baby is not, so be it from the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, asleep in it, so it is built. 
Think back, if it after a pair of phenomena scared shows, it is recommended to receive advice, or to find out what reason the child for the fear. 
If they understand what it says so usually (not), is the child is under pressure in order to carry out an interrogator opening street market-style negotiations and more information. 
You are so that it can achieve nothing, because when the baby is sleeping, it is unconscious and not to think about it. 
In addition, she will listen to what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it that says, that is why you are careful with the interpretation of the information and the lessons from it. 
Perhaps, says the child that her the night to hear and its secrets know. 
Not even as a joke. 
This caused a great deal of fear. 
So, makes you no worries, there is nothing wrong, this is a moment that only a few minutes. 
Finally Illhäusern... 
After a long drought Illhäusern is finally back on the pitch on course for success. 
Without much effort erspielten the Gelb-Schwarzen many Torchancen and shipped it to implement one of them, and so the game to win. 
The speed of that meeting, in which the attacker trouble had to show their skills, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the host captain Kauffmann, whose long-distance shot just at the corner is lost, with ease Illhäusern should dominate the game, and it was only one Fonderflick with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high pass Romain and with a shot in the foot tip, the defence of Denmark challenge. 
The rival team blockte in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be crucial with the first two by Riahi and temporale Torchancen won, and immediately afterwards, with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, the just right, was to adopt a ball back, in a first attempt by Diebold had been repelled. 
But the illhäusische Torschütze should be lucky not long can enjoy and about 12 minutes later to the bank will be sent, making his team comrades numerically vastly inferior to continue to play. 
Denmark, however, knew it was not exploit a illhaeusischen Elf and no major problems, the only withdrew a little, in order to increase their defence ', except in the last seconds of the game in which the ball after a mess very close to the bar is lost.

Obama, winner after points in the first Fernsehduell 
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by a further to find out who emerged as the victor, John McCain or Barack Obama. 
As expected, predicted the QGs on the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats their own victory in this Fernsehduell, that of a third of the American families should be pursued. 
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's output, although quite handsomely, not 'brilliant' enough was, for him to explain its decline in the election polls five weeks before the presidential elections. 
The Gallup-Institut of an opinion poll published on Saturday was that Obama is ahead by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat, clearly the better power. 
In the still undecided voters, those on which it is now, Obama with 39% as the winner in the polls, while according to a CBS-Umfrage 25% of them see McCain as the winner. 
Obama should his head start on Thursday with the good work of his competitors Joseph Biden in first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin is expected, can confirm 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate them. 
It has good instincts, however, warned this weekend, Bill Clinton. 
The siebzigjährige McCain not heard on his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy to the forefront, and very clearly the 'naivety' of his opponent on these issues to emphasise that the heart of this first Fernsehduells formed. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... ', he stressed several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama on the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge, at President to be", he also assured. 
An attack point since yesterday in the Republican election advertising is preached. 
Obama himself said that he represents the future. 
He was short and to the point, without from the version to be. 
He grew his ability to the fore, good decisions and the image that the world of the United States has to renew. 
"McCain has still not understood, whereas Obama ', set this weekend, a democratic election advert against accused in the Republican, was not the full extent of the crisis to have covered on the' Americans' burden from the street. 
"During the 90 minutes of the debate had John McCain a lot of things to say about me, but nothing on you ', Obama prangerte yesterday in front of 20,000 people at an election meeting the in Nord-Carolina in strömendem rain had gathered. 
He mentioned not even the words' middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, the most appropriate for the Americans, even the economy on the brink of the abyss to save a clear advantage. 
The coming week could represent a significant turning point, estimated yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
The democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obama's with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
The democratic candidate is the current crisis' the final sentence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and Senator McCain supports been ". 
After he had once again stressed that he probably would even create, taxes for 95% of Americans despite the volatility on Wall Street, the Senator from Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy sources, together with the introduction of a health insurance scheme, for his first priority may have had. 
McCain, on the other hand, was a plant by 2030 from 45 nuclear power stations.

"Have you noticed that an election was held in Minsk? ' 
Young people and opposition figures demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital, in advance to reject the results of the parliamentary elections. 
A few hundred White Russians gathered Sunday evening for closure of the polling stations in the market square of Minsk, against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections to protest. 
Although not yet been announced, many young people have come against the power of Alexander Lukachenko show: 'The dictator should resign.' 
Some are that they have not chosen: 'What is the point, but they have always been if it with my voice to do what they want, says a young people. 
They do not believe that the regime, which the foreign observers in the best light has shown, the negotiations with the European Union, it is prepared to take a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the not issue visas for 40 leading Belarussian personalities and the Aufeislegen of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections by the observers viewed as a clean. 
According to the opposition were it not. 
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count, he regretted Yuri Potemkin, press secretary of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous coalition of 12 parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, said Alexander Milinkiewicz, a former opposition candidate for the presidential election and leader of the 2006 Pro-Europa-Bewegung, because it is of importance of who the voices auszählt, and here is the executive. 
If members of the opposition in Parliament, it will be because they were appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into Parliament can air time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals mean. ' 
The opposition is guilty of it, therefore, to intervene in the political game, because "of the dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, heavily in debt to Russia, in a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of a protectorate of Russia to be. 
Now, we want to be independent. ' 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the voting process, not to recognize the election as valid. 
They stressed that the turnout figures appear too high, and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) the way for any kind of manipulation has paved. 
"Have you noticed that an election has taken place? Asks the leader of the Social Democrats, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners were released in August of this year. 
In the polling stations was no one. 
And it will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, and those who are most likely to meet the aspirations of the government. ' 
The silence of the night reduces back on the October Square. 
The television to congratulate President Lukachenko and the members of the central election commission on their success. 
Meeting - from the blood that safe again was 
Yesterday Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
And, above all, has it public confidence restored, the by the scandal by the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was shaken. 
As we know, were the from the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross national blood reserves managed during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C virus contaminated. 
In the face of this tragedy and the public discontent led the government of Canada in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led an investigation, the objective was to bring light into the circumstances that had led to a tragedy of this nature, and directives, a fresh disaster in order to prevent this type. 
While judges Krever even hesitate to make his report, then, several provinces of a committee on its feet, whose goal it was to a new system for managing blood in Canada to develop. 
In Quebec, met the committee Gélineau this task. 
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, the other provinces and the two territories to take care. 
'1998, when their work has included Hema-Quebec, 38% of people had little confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers, Dr Décary. 
The situation was disappointing. 
Through the enormous efforts to ensure the safety of the blood and to improve the work in this area during the following years, we have to win back the confidence of the public ", says it before it proud stressed that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94% of the population of Quebec Hema-Quebec had confidence in. 
However, Dr Décary reserves in the knowledge that 'trust is a very fragile ". 
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec is, according to the principle of caution. 
At that time we saw the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe with, a new type of the disease, told this woman since 1998, the leadership. 
"And we had not the slightest idea whether these disease on the blood could be transferred. 
So we have heard on one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau to the exclusion of measures to be applied, and when you do not know if the disease progresses slowly, as is clear in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that has run through a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
So we took in April 1999, no blood of people on, since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. 
Now, a few years ago, it was undoubtedly proved that this disease transmitted by blood. 
This event has shown that the principle of caution, which we would apply, is indeed a meaning. 
In 1999, appeared on the market a much more precise technology to detect HIV: The Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which will make it possible to directly in the blood of the donor to prove the existence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as in the tests used to date. 
The NST enabled it to shorten the incubation period, between the time when the person was infected and that if the first viruses through our techniques can be detected in the blood, is taking place, explains the specialist. 
This time in a period of less than a week to be reduced. 
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected, without being aware of it, and we could not see much reduced. 
These improvements enabled it to the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion to transfer to a considerable degree. 
Today, there is a risk of 12 million people, with HIV infected blood to preserve. 
"In other words, this means that you should distribute 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood distributed, it would take more than 24 years before a occurs in the HIV on a Blutkonserve was transferred. 
I believe that it can now feel well, if we get a blood transfusion or, in order to restore the health ', says the Direktionschefin of Hema-Quebec. 
"Our challenge for the next ten years it is, the safety of our products. 
We will never know which germs can come into the system. 
Only last year, which is on the island of Réunion Chikungunya-Virus appeared, the, just as the Westnil-Virus, by insects transmitted by blood. 
We must monitor incessantly, drives Dr Décary further before they stressed that, in addition to a safe supply Hema-Quebec also provide an adequate supply. 
"The demand is rising, because the population is getting older. 
As the treatment of aggressive cancer are often the patients need new red blood cells or Blutplättchen. 
The ageing of the population also impacts on the blood donor network from which an average of only 3% of the blood donations are appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. ' 
It can any healthy person, of the 18 years or older is and the eligibility criteria all 56 days, six times a year to give blood. 
On average, to be 14% of people that their blood available, not accepted because they, for example, of AIDS or malaria are ill, and who has been in a country where malaria is prevalent, for a year by the blood donations excluded. 
"With these 3% will we make it, an inventory to preserve what the needs of the hospitals. 
A lack of supplies are very rare. 
But we must renew the Members of this donor network if they get older and are no longer able to donate blood. 
It is hard to convince the people, to donate blood, but, above all, to keep them and to produce regular donors. 
Life is now so hectic that you rarely find the time, an hour in the blood donation to spend ', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of $297 million Hema-Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, almost exclusively for serious violations of fire is used. 
This tissue to be investigated, processed and frozen before they are Hema-Quebec stored, the only public cord blood bank Quebec managed.

On the north Charest 
Of the Prime Minister does not rule out elections before the end of the year. 
As soon as the General Assembly of the liberal party was out, went Jean Charest yesterday after Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying, in today ’ s part election to be elected. 
"The course of our last great border in the north postpone ': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest yesterday with visual funds in the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec presented in Levi, and he followed the guidelines. 
During his address was behind him a kind of images projected mill. 
Three huge screens addressed spectacular images of hydropower stations, mines, of Quebec in 'Google maps' views, maps, etc. 
Great resources as during the election period. 
To the press of the Prime Minister, incidentally, refused to rule out that he hold the elections this autumn, although he said that his diary is very full. 
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister has supposedly for Quebec, namely the of a 'new economic area', the agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario. 
Although in the last time often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister, was the opening up of the North - the northern area on the 49sten latitude - never before have been the subject of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister, however, was limited to explain why the north 'a jewel with enormous potential', but gave no date, no investment figures or exact priorities for the next projects. 
More than a couple of looking at what more could be done, especially in the water, energy, on forest, but particularly in the mining sector, fostered by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of the public infrastructure. 
The list, according to Mr Charests has the north 'nickel, zinc, copper and platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'. 
This' area twice as large as France '' is near us, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to indicate to show that it is a national founder dream to achieve addiction. 
Quebec is very by its link with the North, said it: The streets for gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James-Bucht. 
'It belongs to us, it is our future ", he added, after he had appealed a theatrical break, the huge card back to look at. 
In the north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes an part of Labrador with a, always the Quebec claimed, said the Prime Minister in the press. 
"This is a traditional attitude that all governments. 
There is a fault line of that no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity for this attitude, I will take on behalf of the government, "he declared. 
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', said he and spoke about the North-West passage on the basis of line Eisschmelze throughout the year. 
In this new geopolitical context does the Prime Minister, that it is a duty was to fill this area. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous people and the Inuits? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful to deal with them, and that they were to benefit from this project, especially the young. 
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former pekistischer von Ungava) have already begun discussions with about 30 communities. 
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) an important place, the work has resumed. 
The Prime Minister does not a large assembly from, 'is not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity, at the "we will create a common vision. 
The development of the North will for the rest, in line with the principles of sustainable development to take place. 
The plan discussed North ', and' be regulated, "he promised. 
Jean Charest described this' vision ', as if it is a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister is that before him were in office. 
"As the Liberals, who were ahead of us in the office, we have umgedacht, about the challenges in new growth and Entwicklungschanchen. 
That was, in fact, one of the issues raised by the weekend, the on Friday with a large cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the party leadership opened by Jean Lesage. 
One of the decisions adopted envisages the power station of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm relabel. 
'Of Godbout, the Hydro-Quebec has built on Lesage, of the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of water electricity has achieved to Bourassa, of the James-Bucht, always knew our party, to determine the future', said Jean Charest. 
In the press he took on a different, this time conservative project, and on the programme "Roads to the North 'by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In relation to the project hydroelectric dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, said Mr Charest, whose operation was planned for 2012. 
"The remains with us, but I have to be here, he trusted his party members on what caused in those applause storms. 
The Prime Minister, who said in April that it 2008 and 2009, would give no elections, has, in fact, the possibility of holding an election this autumn, as it is possible in terms of the law, not excluded. 
He stressed, however, that his diary is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The General Assembly on weekend earned the liberal party boss a platform from nationalist plans, particularly from the Constitutional relevant objectives ", which were adopted without further ado: The PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'specificity Quebec' in the Constitution. 
They would also like Quebec members of the Council of the Canadian radio and telephony names, and that this a veto on the judgments made in Quebec. 
The opposition have been the guidelines of the plan included North with scepticism. 
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has the policy on the development of the Nord-du-Quebec out again, the government has introduced Landry 2001. 
According to their has the liberal government, as it came to power in 2003, abstained from voting this to apply. 
If they do, 'we would be a lot further on today', ruled Mrs Marois on the side of their candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has been in favour of the adoption of a plan to support Northern by the government. 
"But what we want is that this is not only a great idea", said the party leader, Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, the today returned from holiday. 
The letter - A entehrtes country 
Mr Vic Toews, still exported -Minister Justice '(the irony) in the cabinet Harper was to the last summer, prevented about Louise Arbour to say that it was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
This woman who an interminable fight for justice has led and all our admiration deserves, with outrage to cover, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister from, as on Stephen Parker itself. 
We are dealing with a government to do, as only for all the countries affected their in the concentration camps Guantanamo captive compatriot home has not taken. 
A government that does not even considered that Omar Khadr was still a young person, and crossed the things that are being accused of. 
The only government, which, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier in inhuman conditions. 
The only, a Justice parody downwards, to assess the guilt of the accused. 
We remind ourselves that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr to bring home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada. 
It is this government also closes its eyes to the torture: They are more interested in little that a young adult after so many years of painful for mentally certainly always will be broken. 
We are not yet aware, but what we are witnessing is an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which Harper constantly as a banner in front of it, and it sounds so noncommittal out of his mouth. 
It is, therefore, the time has come, in which there is no morality is more: It is a Canadian citizen abuse arbitrarily, tortured and imprisoned, quite as they see fit of a Government, until today is supported only by the minority (may he after the 14 October quite belong to a minority...). 
Many voters think that their salvation at a party, the virtue, law and order preaches. But they do not see that this government has broken away from the what the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere else. 
Free opinion - The Orwellian speaking of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, the Canadian gold mine Vize-Generaldirektor Barrick Gold. 
This confirms, following a Orwellian logic that the biggest gold collection society in the world for libel over six million against three authors and a small funds sought a publishing house, with the aim of a 'public transparent debate'. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then judge it on the truth, especially in the case of slander complaints, but above the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was by Mr Garver completely hidden. 
As for Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everyone in the ruin of driving who dares to take a of their opposite view to represent. 
No matter how the process is based, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will spend significant sums to prepare for their defence and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight, the from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine will be paid. 
The tactic in this unequal fighting is also often, the defenders to ruin an amicable settlement in order to force the other side is muzzled and also discourages anyone who dares to take once again to deal with the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have their view of the situation in the face of public opinion must present. 
By contrast, what in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold is working, and is normally in Canada debates through the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe fought. 
This could have been enough for gold mine their books and documents disclosed and have a real debate opened by the newspapers, media, publishing and financing of independent Prüfteams, the light on this question would bring. 
But Barrick Gold seems no confidence in public opinion and to have dismissed the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir between Canada with a hand. 
Could Mr Garver explain how he, at the same time, a 'public' debate can ask and yet the views of these public scorn? 
Apparently includes this word in the world of the Vice-President only the generously remunerated lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very nice beengte view of the term. 
In a democracy, the detractors have the right to speak. 
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or not to understand is that the public, the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada supported, this particularly does, because they the brutal attitude of the gold mine is opposed. 
The public is willing, Barrick listen and to judge, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many as Knebel-Klage exercise (in the course of the 'public debate Barrick Gold' has a call to the authors of Noir between Canada, in which she demanded of them, not to use this term...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the complaint of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the truth, the essential for any democratic society. 
They completely denied the right to quote credible sources and on facts and interpretations to discuss form the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it in a country such as Canada is impossible, subjects to research and discuss, the rich companies like this world, who else can it do? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead by the scientific standards by the authors of Noir between Canada have been spent. 
It has a right to reply. 
The university environment, to which we belong, White for a long time, debates and inconsistencies in the control and conflicts to be resolved. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, in no mood to a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time for the governments to take measures to limit the this type of unfair complaints. 
Bailout for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans see 
The Bush administration and the senior Members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan over 700 billion dollars, and of the financial crisis to stop, for months, the Wall Street shaken, still needs of the two chambers of Congress are adopted. 
The main issues are: A better control of the Member about the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms for the repayment of public money is used to ensure that new orders, the number of because of payment arrears gepfändeten homes stem, and have the right to monitor the salaries in the senior executives of the companies are paid. 
The American few Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and the in the negotiations representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, stated yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon. 
"We have great progress towards an agreement made, the market will be effective, said the representatives of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"It happened to the real economy and the American people before the rate crisis on Wall Street to protect ', the Democrat said. 
"This is the basic point: If we do not do so, be the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans enormously be ', said of the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations have been held over the last two hours to speed up, for fear of the impact that a second failure on the mood of investors. 
The deadline, which had been agreed, was the market opening this morning. 
The two American presidential candidates, the late involved in the negotiations were, rather than supporters of the agreement, without fail, however, to express their dissatisfaction that they must take on this extreme way. 
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama integral to the addition of certain orders for agreement, especially those that allow it to the owners, to keep their homes, and such, the salaries of senior executives of the rescued by the state companies. 
"If the taxpayer has asked a question, because of the irresponsibility of certain people to take extraordinary measures, this is nothing as we could congratulate itself. 
But these measures are necessary ', he declared on the American television stations. 
At another station when he was asked whether he will vote for the proposed plan, said his Republican opponent John McCain: 'I would like to know the details, but I hope it. 
'The phrases that I have read, [show] that this one thing is that we all have to be swallowed, and with which we will move forward. 
The option, to do nothing, is quite simply not acceptable ", he said. 
Of the 700 billion Dollar-Plan designed, with the taxpayers' money 
He comes 14 months after a crisis, by the bursting of a housing bubble, first of all, the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (sub-prime) led before embarking on further forms verbreiteterer bonds did (PCAA), and finally in freezing the financial capacity and ruin the banks and financial institutions has resulted. 
A group of Republican Member of Parliament was it, the last week the first attempt to agreement would fail. 
Since then, the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of societies in dire straits, only guaranteed by the government, and not to be bought, believe we escape the impasse. 
The point of order for all to tie up in Congress has also added a disposal, which says that, if the government with this programme within five years of losses to do it, they then new taxes could, in order to regain their capital. 
The new plan sees the payment of a first $250 billion to the further 100 billion can be added, if the President believes it is necessary. 
The payment of further 350 billion in a repeat vote must be adopted by Congress. 
In exchange for his help is given Washington shares in the companies, which he did in the case of profits to bring dividends, and it can sell, if the storm is over drawn. 
The federal government will have the opportunity, the Pfändungsverfahren on the homes of the affected by this plan property loans are tied to halt, and, moreover, deadlines for repayment and set the severance pay to the senior executives of the companies involved are paid. 
The developers of the plan would have it, that the House of Representatives today votes on it, and the Senate then on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light. 
Indeed, rose yesterday, another votes against this project, both the Republicans and the Democrats. 
"Obviously we do not understand Washington ', said of the Republican Garett Scott, a member of the Finanzkommission of the chamber, his voters. 
"Yes, we have a major financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not the is the fact that the taxpayers foot the bill. 
The democratic Members Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress, the 'Kaukus called the skeptics', things differently, but comes to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureate, have written to tell us: We ask the Congress, not under pressure to leave, and think carefully about what is going down, he declared yesterday. 
At the same time we got in Europe, once again, the proof that it is a global crisis. 
At an emergency meeting of the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group company, for 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars). 
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that they would give up their Konkurrentin buying, which is in great difficulty, since they 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis through the risky housing loans in the United States has lost. 
Company, employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not a lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
Secondly, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank. 
This is precisely what the savers and budgets estimate, as insecure times now announce. ' 
During this time was on the other side of the English Channel in the British government, another of the financial crisis in dire straits to nationalise the bank. 
According to the English press the government would all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion (75,5 billion dollars) from real estate loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander yesterday announced that the branches and customers accounts of the British bank would buy up. 
Bradford and Bringley would be after the second bank Northern Rock, which the British government since the start of this financial crisis must be nationalised. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of a dedicated icon 
Its beauty with the Azur blue eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say that his weakness. 
The American actor with the charming smile from the narcissistic mirror freed? 
Yes, and no. 
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have him as from a position of power, the truly dreadful monster which brings to the world. 
But what for a great Dauerläufer! 
The on Friday at the age of 83 years in the consequences of lung cancer at his Crawford ranch in Connecticut late Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of he golden years. 
He was less inflicted was monumental as Brando, which he thought for a long time and he is a kind of rival on the screen, was careful in his spectacle is certainly even more fragile, but as an apostle of freedom and the Sprengens dramaturgischer conventions. 
Often Vermischtes blood is wonderful children. 
He was 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jews and an ethnic Hungarians mother born. 
From his European roots should one of the glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive ego, utmost quality feature. 
Because it was a whole country, which in the love Self-made-man was, in the fighters, the in the Pacific War has been wounded in the shoot-out, of the early 1950s spectacle studied art at Yale and then the Actor's studio in New York, visited before he success at the theatre, on television and, soon, had in the cinema. 
The same man who fought for the rights of citizens, was the driver in the 1979 24-Stunden-Rennen of Mans Second was, and also a Sexsymbol, even though he, together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 Vorzeigebeziehung lived in one. 
With him disappear the unknown facets of this arcane, modest, committed and to the glamour of the show business on sensitive stars, whose mystery will never be completely resolved. 
A decent man, in the true sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman's left the Kinoliebhaber this weekend in Taumel, while in the dark screen the memories of all its major roles were taken place. 
More than half a century of American film art in constant change with him over. 
Since pushes back the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), and the young man who his sinnliche Mrs (Elizabeth Taylor) in The cat in the hot Blechdach rejects, the 1958 by Tennessee Williams verfilmt. 
It will be a much shorter recent memory (1990) raised in its sensitive Mr Bridge, in his high age of a wedding concerned will not fulfilled all its promises. 
So many other Paul Newman's were in the course of history. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable Boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean was thought, after the death was resumed in 1956 and the Newman right announced. 
This pleasant crook in the towering The Sting (The Clou), the 1973 with the Oskar for the best film was excellent. 
As verbitterter and vengeful Billardspieler in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961). 
This point by the times, that was it. 
Still he. 
In his CV unite eras. 
The youth knows it first of all from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), when Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of a Eishockeyteams. 
His fans found him in The Hudsucker 1994 Proxy the brothers Coen again. 
With a last role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes joined in the circle. 
Unlike several cinema legends, the early enough in the film world have withdrawn, Newman should remain in place for a long time, and in Hollywood, his assets, his Prunk and betrayed his concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour as living challenge to the 'under playing', as his vice versa too expression of strong performance. 
The preserve has not always been easy for the fine Paul Newman, the roles for a long time zuflogen only way. 
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: Neurotiker, alcoholic, Fieslinge or desperate people, with their perfect depiction of his slide and its response reflected. 
As a director Newman unknown sides revealed his true making sensitivity. 
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian citizen, Margaret Laurence) with his wife, Joanne Woodward in the main role, it became a feinsinniges women portrait of melancholy. 
He and his son Scott lost by an overdose, this 1984 devoted his film Harry and Son, a work full of subtlety and sadness. 
In the flood of honours the yesterday on Newman ergoss, declared his close friend and former Waffengefährte Robert Redford (they had together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid played) extremely: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.' 
Generosity and love of life were essential characteristics of the late actor. 
Apart from his legendary career is now also a great champion of civil rights, the protection of the environment and independent cinema, an opponent of the drift Hollywoods, then. 
We have to him often with the foot in parings Vinaigrette fully, in Saucen, pastries or other foods are see, and this is quite distasteful, although we initially found it funny. 
The profits from its turnover was nevertheless, in his Foundation for children in need. 
Rather than rest on his myth, threw himself Newman until the shot. 
He has left behind his five daughters a letter with these rates: 'Time and to the final was your father incredibly grateful for his good luck. 
It was a privilege to be here. ' 
And for us, it was an honour, the life of an intelligent and generous American actor to pursue. 
A good citizens, in the closest and in the broadest sense. 
What has been produced in the bill factory of award & amp; administration.? 
On 8 October start the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János award and his accomplices. 
The defendants, in particular, the participation in the organised crime, and grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, among other things, accused of falsifying documents. 
According to the Public Prosecutor have been the from the tenders lukrierten funds used for his own purposes, while the services provided with counterfeit bills were often proves. 
Government money and subsidies from the government - a total of 65 million HUF part - in the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private individual EU funds. 
As the investigation authorities announced, were the retirement does not mean the tender money fictitious invoices presented, and the clubs should not be complied with their obligations. 
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills have been rigged. 
The bill blocks have been on the market of Józsefváros purchased that left some seals Kiskunhalas in carrying out. 
The decision on what companies should be issued the bills, was on that tour north of Lake Balaton decided, on the István Lados of János award was sent. 
In the course of this "fact-finding tour" should find Lados pensions and restaurants. 
He demanded bills on the Konsumationen, later on these texts based bills for the Youth and Sports Ministry, the social and labour ministry, as well as the issue of Budapest. 
These bills are predominantly by István Lados and his accomplices, András Őri have been manipulated, according to our information for the Constitution of the relevant reports have been responsible. 
One of the objectives of Lados' "fact-finding tour" was a beer locally. 
As two of award administration in 2003, according to invoices issued, is the catering business neunzigköpfige group of associations Biztos Pont Egyesület bewirtet have. 
But now the head of the company, such a large group would not have been at once in the restaurant suited event. 
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002, at the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also made serious mistakes in violation of form and content. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and not more than 10 people can house at the same time, according to the Court of 130 guests should be stopped. 
The imagination, the Court of counterfeiters were obviously just as no limits, as it was at the Pigal Kft., a catering company, in its accounting records of clients Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá according to prosecutor presented not. 
As business leaders Győző Farkas the hvg.hu stated, it was immediately clear that it was counterfeit documents, as him by the Public Prosecutor during a consultation documents have been presented. 
"Our company name and the tax number were on the wrong stamp on appropriate". 
And further: Apart from form mistakes was also the fact that the company is home to a hundred people have after they have a total of 11 rooms, the impossible so many people place. 
Also on the bill is restaurant have been cited, it is the restaurant for some considerable time. 
The industrious bill counterfeiters also have failed to verify that the of them targeted Budapest travel agency received only offering trips abroad, and then they have Ungarn-Reisen on the Barzahlungsrechnung told what the accounting practice also denied the company. 
As in the course of the investigation was known, they also have bills VAT, although travel office services to a country outside the EU, value added tax free. 
The level of VAT was a total of four from the hotel to the Foundation Révfülöp Kft. Jobb invoices issued Jövőért wrong, because the operational instead of 25 only 15 per cent VAT charges, will also be of the staff exclusively mechanical bills issued, the false documents were, however, hand in writing. 
Another mistake, of the "Rechnungslegern" was undermined, was that it, in a case "were transport" as output had indicated, although this of the specialist firm on investment advice is not offered, shared with the public prosecutor. 
Further form mistakes - false accounting format, false stamp - was due to the fact that the on együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont invoices issued has been exposed as a fraud. 
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sport camps Kunfehértó, whose business leaders beteuerten, never to have the bills issued. 
Another "mistakes" is the counterfeiters in HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza undermine: This society was to the time (2001), particularly at sunset, when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület there have eaten, the mass administrators were hence, the bills do not even issued. 
Fake aware of 
The other group of Rechnungsleger are people, which was perfectly aware that they should fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a total of about 4 million HUF issued. 
According to the indictment was the executive director of the Collab Kft. by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing the fictitious invoices persuaded. 
Now the winding-up order Kft. also Biogate with award and company have worked: In 2003, the Foundation is to the GmbH Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, and the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit bills worth a total of 5 million HUF supplies have focused on not related services rendered. 
But there was also little payments, as the bills immediately after their exhibition were cancelled as the victims in their documents, however, have to be forgotten. 
The third group of Rechnungsleger includes people directly associated with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, but not auffindbaren fuel and vehicle trading firm. 
The company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of EDV-Komponenten worth a total of about 18 million HUF issued. 
According to the investigation authority since 14 September 2005 in cash investment Kft. from winding-up order Kiskunhalas acts as a buyer of these bills. 
Business leaders of this company was a Rumanian, which the companies also documents Iván Kubatov should be delivered, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information, has been Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of the GmbH. Atlasz and to the clubs Hoppá, and együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány issued and their value even cashed in. 
The firms Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. of Romanian bricklayers Iván Kubatovs express request to have been set up. 
In truth, however, was none of these firms active as loud Angeklagtem was lack of contracts. 
Nevertheless, he could benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplices, of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, with the preparation of the firms founding documents was charged, he has, on behalf of the company bills to the award in connection with the clubs issued, such as in Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
As a whole Kubatov 15 bills in the total value of HUF 14,2 million cash on behalf of the companies investment, Delta Trió, Jos Fa-Bani, Jos Linaxtrade investment and to the organisations have issued. 
The public prosecutor's office estimates that 10% of the Court Kubatov sum and the VAT could have cashed. 
The company Kubatov even Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition imaginary bills have abused - in this case, the bills were the applications of Biztos Pont resolved. 
The firm Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért have their applications in January 2006 in the not-for-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA"). 
Both received 500, 000 Forints ever, however, have benefited from these amounts inappropriately. 
In order to cover up, they have the TMA five fictitious accounts of the works team Kft. presented. 
Moreover, these bills were in the raid on the offices of Árpád Ministry Kemecsei in teaching. 
In the negotiations will now by some of the defendants with a confession on the approach of the Court of counterfeiting, as they have already taken before the public prosecutor, were expected. 
A sensation could be, if the main defendants János award to a full confession resolve. 
His previous claims were less in detail, and although he had already promised on several occasions, fully to report on everything, from his confession. 
The question therefore remains an open question whether this in his interest, whether the Socialists a pact with him about the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have concluded, and whether award in exchange, is willing to take responsibility. 
But it is quite possible that award the "Beleidigten" plays after his appeals to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest has fallen on deaf ears. 
While other criminals, the with economic crimes is far greater damage and these have not paid, at large, or at least under house arrest, remains award this possibility. 
The psychology of the Überbietens - or why we are prepared to pay more 
At an auction buyers tend to spend more and the Feilgebotene therefore to exaggerate the effect. 
Neurologists to economic researchers and the University of New York is managed to neurologisch-ökonomischen foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior to discover. 
According to a "Science" magazine publicised study want to the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, beaten and are therefore not be prepared to pay even excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried to the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. 
A group of volunteers Lotto should play, while the other in a play with these action participated in both cases - were the active brain regions of the subjects through functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI) investigated. 
In two games, the participants were able to win money, but has been increased activity of the Striatum, of a set below the Gehirnrinde, losers of the auction measured in the opponent's sort of an essential role. 
In addition to many other functions is this brain region for the "even reward" of the nervous system. 
The researchers said that the price increase could be by avoiding an overreaction of the Striatums explain. 
Their thesis to back up, have the economists in the group of researchers in addition studies to follow up the money. 
In this case, should three groups against a partner under different conditions to bid. 
The control group was told the real value of the product, then they have made their operations. 
Another group of 15 dollar reward promised, if they emerge as winners from the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which in the case of a lost game were also lost. 
The difference between the two groups was then simply that the emphasis on the one on the profits, while the other was on the losers. 
As evidence of the idea expressed by neurologists were the members of the "against the losers' group of games to higher operations ready, as those in the control or the" profit "group. 
"These results fall of any previous economic theory. 
These have the patterns of behaviour observed in auctions, so far, only to the joy on the profits, or the risk prevention. 
The contradiction between these two theories was thanks to the imaging neurological procedure dissolved, so that we now have a third statement of Europe, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics faculty of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When is the doctor? 
The world around half a billion people are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary will these chronic liver disease listed among the leading causes of death. 
The number of those infected, estimated at hundreds of thousands will, however, be dealt with only seven thousand, what it is that the patients often do not know that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the set of caused by different viruses, infectious liver disease. 
The symptoms are often similar - Leberentzündung and yellow addiction are often, but differ the pathogens and the diseases from each other. 
Depending on the virus spread the hepatitis viruses on two different species: Hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D are the viruses through blood and other body liquids (such as sperm, or be given spittle Scheidensekret). 
Travellers will be a vaccine against the virus A and B in any case, recommended against the virus C there is no vaccine. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A show around two three weeks after consumption of the polluted food and generally are of illness, weakness, stomach pain and splutter accompanied. 
Then comes the yellow on the skin and in the eyes of, the chair is bright, the dark urine, and the recovery to take two for three weeks. 
World around 1 million people die every year in the caused by hepatitis B, far more serious illnesses such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected patients is in medication. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: Untreated it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most of those infected do not even know about their illness, because the pathogen destroyed the liver cells - dressed in many cases show the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
It is therefore timely prevention, such as regular inspection must, essential. 
There are three groups where the disease is more common: Those who themselves from 1991 to undergo a blood transfusion, drug addicts, and Tätowierte. 
At the moment, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide estimated at 200 million. 
Since the disease during a routine laboratory inquiry is detectable, it is advisable, at the first signs of unknown origin of the family doctor visit. 
In time, the disease is curable, the virus could be eradicated, thus increasing the risk of infection, non-existent, and prevent the development of cancer. 
Of the 30 September is the world day of hepatitis, 2004, for the first time in the world of patient representatives. 
The aim of the action is the awareness of this chronic Leberentzündung caused by viruses, their creation and the importance of early detection. 
Believers have less pain? 
As the latest research results show that religious belief as a kind of "painkiller" all honesty, which already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists of the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was investigated whether belief in God the pain of the people affected, reported the British "Telegraph saying". 
In the wake of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate the bulk of the pain. 
By means of a Hirn-Scan technology could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of her brain, which is responsible for the pain of regulation. 
The study was the first in a research project that also alongside scientists, philosophers and theologians of various departments in the university. 
The attempt was one of the subjects funkelndes device attached to the left hand, which made the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to hard to concentrate on two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and on the other hand, Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin." 
The researchers hoped that the sight of these young Mrs Maria among the believers would provoke a kind of religious blossom, while it identified as Vincis picture, because it is very different from the other paintings and was seen as a reassuring. 
People ever spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in this time in four stages, while they either the religious, or the other paintings should regard. 
Catholics report that they had the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they "surrounded by", and they would be "peace and quiet". 
During the Betrachtens of religious Gemäldes they have about 12% reported less pain than if they Leonardos station had in mind. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attended the attempt, said that it could be similar effects, also with other, strong images also operating in the atheists, they should be just the photo. 
"We would have to find a picture, the very positive sentiments, such as a mother or father," the psychologist. 
The Anglikanische Bishop Tom Wright, welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of the faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," Wright. 
After these excellent results, the only question is, what effect a Madonna-Bild Leonardos or other comparable Malers on the pain regulation of believers. 
Would the high-quality young Mrs Maria even achieve better results? 
You are what you are on you mitteilst 
On the occasion of its tenth birthday can Google fair to say: It is in the pockets of the people as to find, as on their heads in the sky: It knows where the people have their holidays spent on the specialist they go and what they moved. 
And still not be enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the chief executive officer of Google. 
In the direction of skeptics who plagued by Orwellian nightmare visions, can he do: This would be the very essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google, more personal data on users to collect and so the original purpose of the company to come closer to that they "all the information put in this world". 
Schmidt said that Google was after ten years of less stable work world still only at the beginning of the information collection. 
Asked about the status quo in five years, said Schmidt: He wanted, Google would be able to issues such as, "What should I do tomorrow?" Or "the job really fits me?" To answer, however, software programmes are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet research in the wake of the search terms were registered, and also the IP addresses, from which was sought, and the two sides. 
For example, the two years of imported "Personalized search" allows the visitors to its own search course to store and later resort, so that the hit later can be generated much more precise, and on the same logic based the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system tailored products and services as a result of the previous preferences recommends. 
The users help wondering what in the event of a data abuse is happening, "If you look what I make", are some concerned whether the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In most cases, however, it is more likely to be represented by the company, potential power, the terrifying works, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power, the many Internet-Usern to reject forces. 
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms not only stored, but if also be passed on to third parties, and in this legislative cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet-Users. 
A perfect example was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google the Brazilian government information on submitted by the Gemeinschaftssite called "Orkut" were collected and also an identification of Pädophilien enabled. 
Personal rights concerned users could breathe a sigh of relief, but in May, as Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF successfully against the FBI before Court withdrew: That Google can also in future with no point to the constitution to force the FBI information on secret question issue. 
(However, the federal government has successfully the publication by 50,000 Webadressen and 1,000 search understood in years, with reference to the youth protection law passed obtained, but she was the list of individual users, or its Web- and search term list retroactively denied on two months.) 
Google's image remains controversial: Those that their personal data are reluctant to issue because it through the use of the Google service the loss of their private and space are afraid to criticise the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
However, does the American "Geek-Kultur", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users unites, the next generation of "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even if both at the same goal. 
A possible reason for this is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft requires no identification codes, and his services available for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code Programm-Package and far more attractive, juvenile and seem to be cooler than the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand, says the Geeks of the problematic relationship of the personal rights and the Internet in the sharp knife - a relationship that, particularly in the past few years, thanks to the concept of "Web 2.0" in the centre has arrived. 
In the "Web 2.0" is, in fact, nothing else than collaboration, in other words, the users deliberately left lanes and use the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions of individually are varied, remains the main cause the same, namely to show publicly. 
At the same time, an average of young people can be run on several Gemeinschaftsportalen profile - from Facebook on Xanga, can this through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm link, and can all this, finally, in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm engage. In addition, she blogs can lead, the latest photo galleries are automatically on Flickr and Picasa geostet. 
And a number of other exemplary cases: Looking at the photos of the Party last night take place the girlfriend soon, with whom it has disloyal friend rubbing, or the staff will be made redundant because it in his blog only too honest his anger over the management of air power, one thing is certain: The word "privacy" was interpreted now completely new. 
Who leads a Online-Leben, is what he summaries of, for example, could be in the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth. 
And anyone who tries to keep secret something, or even the Google-Monopol, which can do - such as with Scroogle, a Tool, which is on the search engine of Google grab, but deliberately leaving no trace. 
Many people deliberately did not register at Community sides, so that they are not ever-higher standards, but also the Online-Applikationen of Google, such as text processing and grafische RSS-Feeds tools and can be handled with alternative versions in no huge server farms are linked, and therefore is not the best possible profile generated by users. 
Public opinion is away, however, until Google shows its true colours. 
With its current value of USD 156 billion is the company even before IBM 140 billion (USD), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the faster services not only introduced for Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical observer, however, find the disturbing against poles: For example, the company has led a protest of staff totally rejected after the charges of the company ’ s kindergarten were doubled, it also meant the management, the frequent meals of the staff is too costly. It all seems almost mild against it but that Google in 2006 before the Chinese government even in the knees and was with an agreement, according to which all hit the regime, or those who are against the good taste, would be extracted. 
The internal rules of the group is that in advance no new services will be advertised, but only when this already is also available, but the events of the next few months and years some change again sharply: While some think that Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project now take note, the company will soon have to grapple with the Supreme Court, however, are different because of the system "health" worries, the drawing up of a full health profile on the basis of the findings, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google a genetic database is built, provides the next generation Sci-Fi authors of the substance, "for example Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian fashion a future in which a man as a result of Google data nahbar frightening. 
Two young people help the Doppelmörder Ózd in the traces of elimination 
In connection with the double murder of the police Ózd has two young people questioned in the suspicion, in the removal of the traces to have helped, told the spokesman of the Polizeikommissariats Borsod on Tuesday. 
The young people were geständig, at the moment, they will be charged the aid. 
According to the news agency MTI is two girls at large defending. 
Aid is with a prison sentence of up to five years under threat. 
The suspect of the Doppelmordes of Ózd, a 23-year-old local people man, was taken into custody on Sunday. 
The man is under urgent suspicion, from greed to have deliberately killed several people. 
During the investigation, has shown that the 23-year-old one 53-jährigen due to a larger amount of money. 
The suspect wanted to its debt, however, do not pay, so he was enticing its creditors last Wednesday at a site in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter. 
According to the MTI has the man of the planned - this is also the fact that he the murders with a concealed weapon at the scene of the crime. 
Together with experts is now investigating the explosive device, the police and the circumstances of their use. 
Warsaw Stock Exchange places purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange 
Some 200 million, or 5 billion kronor Czech has the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of Prague Stock Exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer the Poland had put despite the fact that they used by the Czechs as a potential owners of their stock exchange were excluded. 
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange into the state. 
99% of the stock is in the hands of the Polish state, however, more than 60% of the papers in the coming months to sell. 
After news of the Czech daily newspaper E15 "of Poland the so far by the highest price ever for the Prague Stock Exchange was needed. 
As the newspaper reports, have until now, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange and the German stock market offers. 
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that, of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange probably the worst new owners would be, and he also concluded from that in future even to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange on 5-10 billion kronor. 
According to the agreement of the shareholders could be sold 90% of the shares. 
The greatest owners of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank with a 25% participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14,7 and the tiger Four holding S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers 
In their the increasingly devoted to international financial crisis zuspitzenden comments spoke on Tuesday a number of leading European newspapers as the "second 11 September." 
The global Finanzkatastrophe we have to thank for the American president, said some "La Repubblica" - the President was not even able to reach his own party for the draft law back to a, a little relief in the worrying situation should... 
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the multi-billion dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate, of a "second 11 September" to speak. 
Share the press in Madrid orten the scapegoat, also in Washington. 
According to the "El Mundo" is the lack of political leadership to blame for the fact that the world economy now on the verge of collapse. 
The American financial system increasingly at risk of collapsing, and including the whole world will suffer. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, but there is now the threat after the vote in Congress the risk that Washington, not a political tool to crisis management of Europe has. 
The world economy hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations the history of capitalism takes place. 
The threat we can no longer ignore them, says about the Geneva 'day scoreboard. " 
While some states could shake their troubled financial institutions to provide rescue packages, and the banks with the taxpayers' money before the bankruptcy save. 
Will a domino effect, however, and it even more banks go bust, then help neither further cash injections or other emergency measures. 
In the long term, the EU Member States have on their specialization and control of the money markets, centralised. 
On Monday were alone, more than EUR 100 billion of faltering financial institutions paid, reminds the Vienna Der Standard. Moreover, the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, after the Americans now the European taxpayers something deeper in their pockets to resort to emerge from the crisis. 
So far, the EU has not seriously with the crisis, now as a tsunami sweeps on the old continents. 
The "savior" should not immediately with several hundred billion "makes", however, that it would be advisable to keep it, in which case it would be reasonable to see taxpayers' money in order to avoid an even greater damage. 
Intelligent car copied the flight of the Hummel 
What would be the best method for the development of new technologies to accident prevention, if not the Hindernis-Sensoren from the natural to imitate? 
For example, the of the bees. 
At the CEATEC Japan was a startling project presented, in which the Nissan-Ingenieure of Hummeln in the creation of new accident vermeidender systems were inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University Autorobotern Nissan the controlled type biomimetische system BR23C built a Mini-Auto, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
Any bee in the air is their own, oval "private sector," which our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technologie-PR and research development, in the exhibition. 
The eye of the bee up in any direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees can see, plays a major role. 
The function of the kind to imitate eye, the researchers blew the idea of Knife lasergesteuerten gap. 
It identifies BR23C obstacles in the face in a field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, their long distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on Board, which immediately precedes the kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by the tyre at the relevant corner spin. 
Unlike previous systems take place this ploy rather than purely instinctively. 
"If it were not so, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Laboratory (TRL) mobility" and Autoroboter-Projektes. 
The system must react instinctively, and immediately, because the technology the innermost and most vulnerable part of us from recession - is a class, within the accidents are currently still considered inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they other bees. 
And that must be conducted in the fraction of a second. 
However, the exile, in contrast to the bee, not upwards, down, or even diagonal be done - it can only be developed along two dimensions, and only in the direction of the tyres Wendbarkeit. 
During the bee here are infinitely many options open to sidestep other bees, the researchers were in the car robot only the Drehbewegung, or of speeding up and Abbremsens serve. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, the easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh said that it will be on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and still less on the ability to store them. 
This device per second only a few inputs must process and respond appropriately to them. 
It must not store them, or on the basis of previous exercises an intuitive, logical response produce, so that there are just a handful of KB Memory. 
There is no need for Gigabyte- and Megabyte-schwerer Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, the reckoning of Nissan within the next ten years serial moderately in production will be. 
A further application could find the technology in GPS-Satellitennavigation by the motorist aware around barriers and draws him as the target. 
A name for the sündteure child 
We have the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar serious Rettungspaket-Gesetzes before that in several stages will be applied and on the purchase of the bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round the half of the money should be spent. 
In a meeting on Saturday after midnight local time to an end east coast, after the Members of Congress mehrtägigen debates to an agreement on the course 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported. 
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President in the American Congress, and said that we should use the agreement only on paper. 
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on the result: The programme will be efficient and it will be effective, but we must do more. According to Pelosi were not talking about the rescue of Wall Street, but about the helm of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written version of the package was before the opening of the Asian markets, in other words, Washington time Sunday evening 8 p.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), published, however, has no inspired on the stock. 
On Monday the House is first on the draft law to stabilise the economy of 2008, then the Senate in the series. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress made in the middle of the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to promote stability in our markets and our economy to protect, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
The programme, however, is different from the original recommendation from the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars on again for the purchase of the lazy, with loans of strain in the securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche is to a maximum of half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages spent, and 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday. This amount to the purchase of the strain in the credit, bad securities will be spent, and on the further USD 100 billion to the President to decide. 
The programme will be reviewed by a own Commission, the president of the Federal Reserve is a member. 
The other half of the 700 billion depend on a further decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law, the Treasury can also apply a combined tactics: At the same time it is bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages purchased using securities and other "toxic" loans. 
As competent people of the Ministry reported to the purchase both in an auction, and directly. 
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance programme, in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies are expected to damage the appropriate pay fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars as emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad resources, their insurance, or the prevention of a systemic risk by the collapse of a major financial institution will be triggered. 
The necessary steps are, so that we are prepared for the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The head of the troubled and now reliant on government aid, however, banks can expect their Abfertigungen, the overseas long casual "golden handshake called" will be cut by the government. 
Reducing the pay will only be in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury aushilft each. 
The cut essentially means that if the Ministry in the framework of an auction buying, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing head of banks in the pension deported. 
In the case of a direct purchasing the moldy lending aggressively, making the government to ensure that the managers ’ salaries are not excessive. 
The picture also heard that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge not be changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that the more people to participate in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in Manager-Gehältern be regulated by law, commenting on the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. 
The state gains rights of participation in the participating banks, so that the risk to the taxpayer is falling, because they can also take part, as soon as the economy and hence the rescued bank is better. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress in the next five years must submit a proposal, as the taxpayers their lost money from the financial sector get back again. 
However, there were skeptics on both sides, in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, the Californian Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were propelled by the same people who also for the collapse of Wall Street are responsible.

News of the German-speaking area 
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters have been more self-assured within the camp, commented on "Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria are Haider and administration prepared to rule, a rot-schwarze coalition to prevent. 
The mirror (spiegel.de) 
The left Online-Ausgabe located in the German news magazine Franz Walter analysing the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article, "Bavaria revolution vertilgt their fathers." 
According to the renowned political theorists, began the erosion of the CSU long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took his offices. 
The Christian social have renewed Bavaria for decades - now just turn the modern citizens of them. 
The eras rupture is also a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite surprising was the disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday is something come to an end, however, reached almost exactly ten years: The undoubted hegemony of a state party 
For ten years, 1998, ends up in the CSU 47,7 percent and fell for the first time since the 1950s under the Fünfzig-Prozent-Marke 
The repeated itself three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005, in the famous Stoiber-Ära. 
The of the CSU in the federal country modernisation has finally pursued their own mothers and fathers vertilgt. 
Sociologists had already predicted that 40 years ago, but the speed over-estimated their considerably. But without effects were able to secularization education successes, visitors from eastern and northern German in the prosperous regions on the allegiance of Bavaria CSU-Wähler not remain. 
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with option propagation. And this has political consequences. 
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp were critical and own. 
Striking is that in the last few weeks, the classic civic groups, the biggest detachment from the CSU said: The liberal professions, the commercial Bürgertum and voters with baccalaureate as university education. 
Here the support of the CSU has dropped to below 40 percent at all. 
The press diepresse.com) ( 
The conservative Vienna newspaper reported in its "Who with whom? Party leaders reluctant to coalition issues" betitelten article on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the election. 
The SPÖ would like to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs. 
The BZÖ is reflected in all directions open to talks, while the Greens in relation to a coalition not yet set. 
The new elections are over, and now is all about the coalition; in the debates in public television the party leaders could hardly look in their cards. 
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reiterated its desire to negotiate with the ÖVP to want. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation between the two parties is quite possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership, this is already the case. 
The question of whether he is for a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP-Chef as Vice-Chancellor, could imagine, Faymann left open. 
As he said, would have the voters the Schüssel-Molterer-Kurs voted out of office. 
A repeat of this direction were not in question. 
Molterer has, however, reacted cautiously on red offers. 
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP. 
If his party in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently is completely open, and these issues should be discussed ÖVP-intern. 
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was evident in all directions.

Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and the segregation must be broken 
Today the European summit in Paris on equal opportunities started by the presidency of this country, France is targeted. 
In its in the plenary session of the speech made Lívia Járóka, the European People's Party Fidesz-Abgeordnete, particularly on educational segregation, since this one of the most serious breaches of the law is, the Roma children, is also the greatest obstacle to their desire. 
The high-level conference was by the French social and employment minister Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened. 
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, and the most important European legal protection and civil organisations in the area of equal opportunities. 
As the press office of the MEPs from the Fidesz reports, has Járóka attention made that in addition to find discrimination, the Roma in the first place because of its low levels of education from the labour market would drive. 
"The vast majority of the Roma-Jugendlichen has no means education and, thanks to a bad basic education can only a small part of them achieve a university degree". 
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education is a basic human right, which will have a key role in the establishment of other human rights. 
Investment in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States. 
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these links a broad circle - Roma and non-Roma - will be aware. 
Because the sooner a Roma pupils the school begins, the more his chances rise, for productive member of the labour market to be; and by income and sales tax make it their contribution to the national expenditure. 
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma, the right to quality education, to guarantee the bad and segregierte teaching must be stopped" - so Lívia Járóka. 
As the honourable Member said, is a common, ziel- and action oriented approach of the European Union, the Desegregationsprozess on education to accelerate. This is the correct application of the existing and planned Anti-Diskriminierungsdirektiven essential. 
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment break and Roma children the democratic facilities, on the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizens to contribute," said Járóka. 
Since the Congress in Berlin last year is a year with the objective of the summit organised a unique forum for Voranbringung the objectives of the equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination at European and national level, in the sense of the European Year of Equal Opportunities "to create. 
CSU: Mercy on time 
At the end of October will on the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein decided 
Despite the election debacle for heads to roll, not yet, at the top of the Bavarian CSU were postponed the staff debates. 
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein, still remain in office, the question is how long this mercy continues. 
The fate of the Tandems after the disastrous 17-prozentigen Stimmverlust will on the last October weekend at the extraordinary party congress. 
The much gescholtene duo has already but says that it is not on their bellies may name. 
So that they want the angry group and appease the party base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" with the loss of the absolute majority demanded personal consequences. 
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of the high point of his career the Edmund Stoiber - reached the Christian Social Union nor 60,7%. But now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes. 
The CSU was 46 years "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, the 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The Conservatives remain the dominant force in the for the Hungarian economy important southern federal country in the future, but in a coalition rule. 
The first signal of the Party of internal restructuring is the potential successors Hubers, Vice-President and German Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer in the exploration team involved with the liberal Free Democrats, or the right-wing "Free voters' exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition. 
It is an irony of fate in the same way that the list "voters Free" Gabriele Pauli ushering in the legislative period, whose Anti-Stoiber appearance Huber-Beckstein duo has exploited the first, then the determined politician abzuservieren mercilessly. 
The CSU-Führung now concentrated all its energies on the stabilisation Becksteins. 
In the transition process will Stoiber, the as the strings from behind the scenes drew, an active role. The former Prime Minister and the 28 September CSU-Vorsitzender called "the most bitter day of his political career." 
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments in the direction of CDU, in his opinion, the CSU would have far more support from the sister party deserves. 
Other CSU-Politiker interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel. 
Should the CSU, the 2005 national level has contributed a great deal of success, not with a common effort back on its feet, can Merkel after the Bundestag elections in September 2009 Chancellor will not again. 
Merkel, who from their disappointment at the fiasco has made no secret, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU not detrimental to the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What, however, relatively is: The wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis is to continue, however, the Social Democrats. 
With the SPD 18,6% reached its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0 
In Sunday's elections has not a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament. 
Russian observers think that this lies in the prosperity and stability in the by Alexander Lukashenko's country, the OECD, however, suspects illicit goings-on in the counting of votes. 
The OECD, the 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections. 
De term is the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates for decades without opposition from, but has the under the name of "United Democratic Forces (ODS) rallied against party before yesterday ’ s elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, the in the Ugly Elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 his presidential mandate for the fourth time renewed, this time a few members of the opposition in Parliament 'permit would". 
That is why the ODS even of the previously planned boycotts gap. 
Ukraine is thanks to the rising price of gas, imports of ever more dependent on Russia economically. For the relief of the price increases were even credits included, and the country also has the sell-off of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline through the country, leading to the Russians. In the light of the expectations of the opposition was thus the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relations with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians because of the classified as anti-democratic political system in the EU travel ban. 
For a temporary relaxation, the evaluation report of the elections of the OECD, in which the emphasis on the positive movements, rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidate from the elections - was. 
However, the quickly criticized the OECD report on Monday, the campaign - that the opposition should not occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition in the counting of votes was allowed to be present. 
Despite this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: Some political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even smaller confrontation with Moscow by the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia denied, although Russia, with the Ukraine on paper a Föderativstaat forms, the two regions as independent for a month. 
"We have two steps forward and a backwards made, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our tables. 
According to the opposition candidate for the presidential elections of 2006 is a continuation desirable, although "the powerful jitters also have only one opposition members of parliament to be". 
The opposition is not planning any protest action in the face of the results, but rather trying the need for economic reform to the voters. 
"We have here with many problems to overcome the opposition newspapers - must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are getting in the way of the distribution, but I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly," said Milinkevich in allusion to the fact that not even the most aid layer of the Pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose sole merit the production of social security. 
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit is just a matter of time before the to the silence of a Friedhofes gemahnende 'social security" is beginning to crumble, "Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politicians have Russian observers described the elections as democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the deeds, and not words." The lack of the opposition is therefore a test of the maturity of the Belarussian electorate. 
Brunetta: "From now before the work is eating any breakfast" 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi is drehbare doors for the import and exits of officials. 
As from today, will be the measure against those smart Meier to enter into force, the only label and then during the working time coffee drink. 
The new ‘ Anti-Faulpelz-Gesetz "has been today by Renato Brunetta, the minister for public administration and by Mauro Masi, General Secretary of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. 
">" Drehbare doors are a means to enhance work efficiency by a higher attendance rate and more services, "Mr Brunetta. 
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency. 
This is reform, "Brunetta underlines again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi ends the establishment in all the works of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. 
In this regard Masi says: "The election of drehbaren doors is also of great symbolic value." 
The officials there were no resistance, assured the Secretary-General: "This process has been accepted by everybody, cooperation came from all sides". 
All in all, there is now no breakfast during the work of time; final with coffee or Croissant. 
Brunetta 's advises in this respect, with a smile: "A good Cappuccino at 7 p.m. works wonders." 
During a meeting of the Senior Committee of the public administration (Scuola superior della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
The Minister of Rome announced that "within three months, the officials Abwesenheiten reduced to 50%, which means 60,000 people per year, more at work here are". 
Moreover, he adds, it is necessary to the efficiency of public administration of Italy to strengthen 
"The wage dynamics, namely the Minister - were in the last 10 years, twice as large as the private sector and far beyond the inflation rate." 
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have allied with the Brunetta-Dekret, within the framework of the appeal Codacons supported to counter. 
"During the minister for public services with figures on less high profile Absenzen at work, writes the consumer central - the people of the 'active' lazy break. 
In fact, thousands have accurate and valuable officials of the public service allied to the illegal standards of the decree to explain the war. " 
In particular, against the regional administrative court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related illness fought; so are the planned enlargement of the mandatory house arrest of the sick Arbeiternehmers, during which controls can be made and other aspects of the innovations of the minister contested. 
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial" 
Every day happened in Italy 2 500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 are handicapped life sentences. 
For the year 2007 confirm the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni could Sul) that the fatal accidents at work at around 1200. 
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon which almost twice as many deaths as by murders. 
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del could) in every province of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work are committing, the attention of the social institutions and media in this tragic situation. 
"The worrying, of Anmil widespread data and the tragic news of these days to confirm the importance of the issue of prevention in the workplace." Confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in its communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati DE) Pietro Mercandelli invalidi del could. 
The head of state is expressing his "big appreciation for the constant commitment for the prevention of the jobs, the protection of the injured workers, the support for the families of the victims and to increase awareness of public opinion". 
"One empörtes" Basta "has elevated this; understandable in tragedies, relative to its size, some commotion in the media and the public sympathy, but the everyday reality often faced with dramatic events in their own dynamic even repeat". 
Napolitano not is that "it in any case, also a resource problem: It must be crucial investment in education and information." 
A special significance of the many initiatives for a more direct Bewusstwerdung in Schulrahmen on the part of the young people who are feeding the world of work. 
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not divert from his social seriousness. We must put a legislative standard in force and improve. 
For his part, the President of the chamber, Gianfranco Fini "as the phenomenon of work-related deaths an urgent social emergency -- to what the conscience of all of us, and all the institutions insulted forces working on firm rules, these are intended to put an end to the problem". 
"The data of work accidents seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not from that the number of work-related deaths far too high," said President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" positive trend "means less attention. That caused at the end of the tragedy." 
"As to believe that, in fact, too little is taking to the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight through various actions. 
Tighter controls and inspections are, in our view, necessary – so Mercandelli; but even stronger measures to raise workers who start in school. " 
"A further effort is needed - as he is - as the communication and the raising of public opinion. 
But, above all, is a bigger sense of responsibility on the part of the employer to a phenomenon that a social emergency is required. " 
Mercandelli came out on "the gradual erosion of the protection for the work of accident victims" to speak and prangerte the abolition of the social security system in which we are fighting in recent years ". 
"The objective is, therefore, that the workers a guarantee on insurance to return, so that the fate of the victim of a work accident not on voluntary or accidental donations from time to time by a legislator to be decided, dependent will". 
MP3 players under indictment: Risk of hearing impairment 
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players to hear, can lead to permanent hearing damage. 
This report the European Commission in Brussels today in a widespread report the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on the topical and recently identified health risks) of the EU. 
"From the report – as a comment – it is clear that 5-10% of those who are at least five years longer than an hour a week on the day of loud music with portable music devices hear the permanent loss of their hearing risk." 
"I am worried that such a large number of young people, the usual portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, her irretrievable damage without being aware of it," Meglena Kuneva. 
"From the scientific findings, as stated on the part of the EU – is a clear risk for quick action is urgent. 
What really matters, is to raise awareness among consumers and this information on public domain. 
In view of this scientific knowledge, we must once again review the existing control systems so that they are quite effective, and with the new technology is keeping pace ". 
Brussels had the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people asked. 
"The scientists - so close the communication from the EU, confirm that we are very concerned, and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders will now investigate the necessary measures, children and young people better before the noise from portable music devices and similar devices, to protect". 
At the moment, there is already a European standard that the level of noise of portable music devices limited to 100 decibels. The concern about the damage that a large excessive noise could come. 
This damage can be very narrow, in which one to solutions, such as the reduction in the volume and the length of the noise suspension takes place. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the EU that, if the users of portable music devices only five hours in a week noisy (louder than 89 decibels) listening to music that regulatory limits are past, concerning the maximum noise levels in the work place. 
Those who cross the border music, the complete loss of hearing within five years. 
Therefore likely 5-10% of the users of such equipment, whose number at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU can be estimated. 
Roma, Alemanno gives the starting shot for the "Commission for the future of the capital ' 
We catch today 's in March should be over, in June will be assessed. 
That is set by the Capitol end for the work of the Commission for the future of the capital Rome. "The Commission has this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla-Thermen taken. 
In six months, will be the President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission to draw up the leadership lines for Rome. 
Once the project is completed, the city and the county council will assess the analyses and projects, in June in the situation, the strategic plan for Rome with "the official stamp of approval" of the Lord Mayor Kapitols and Mr Alemanno able to conceive. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all the political, social and cultural views are represented in her," Alemanno stressed. "They will be proposals for a development plan to give Rome, the person in charge of the city and the county council. 
There is no distribution of powers, only the will, to have a place, which will be a major project for Rome can develop. 
In March will be the end of their task, and the Commission will disappear again as a project of this kind must have a certain point of arrival. 
In June, as announced by the Lord Mayor - we will present the strategic plan, in which we the work undertaken by the Commission will use ". 
Who the competence of the Commission is in question, as their opinion of binding ermangele, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will make and the quality of their proposals. 
If they, as in France, the Attali-Kommission, quality full results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome, their contribution will be essential. 
Too often, the policy deals with the day-to-day problems and emergencies which occur from time to time. 
We opposed, want a longer period have in mind, with in a deeper perspective seriously in the development of Rome and the future of the city of work ". 
The Lord Mayor of Rome is very keen to clarify the following "This Commission is neither a useless institution, still a wreck: It is absolutely free, it will be the Roman citizens no cents and they will cost us think. It will employ the best brains in the capital". 
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan, which does not static is still tight, at our city of a quality leap - it really necessary - has, and to a common step in the future to do." 
A future, the Lord Mayor of Rome, the "is not just in the current Kommunalgrenzen limit, but much to look", not only in terms of the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama – the first anti-American President? A statement in this House 
A well-known American politicians, the important thing is to be regarded as an independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-american President. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, with his decisions, the economy of the United States dezimierte and with the befeindeten Islam relations used (and still is) as a private citizen. " 
The attacks on Obama are increasingly intense, particularly now, when the elections are in. 
A lady from Miami has in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very smart: He thinks it will be the highest office of a nation who receive a total of two black governors and five black senators saw! ". 
However, these attacks have really not much to say; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: He will be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama will win by a large margin. 
In this case, too, are people since, with the heart and not with the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her in Editorial: Only in the election booth will we know who the real American patriot his voice. 
This is a mentality of the United States, the least kept up to hide. 
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether for Obama or for McCain." 
There are people who swear: If Obama wins, will we emigrate from America. 
Something that never before heard – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so sure. 
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were consulted: What mistakes has Bush during his term of office committed? 89% replied: The war in Iraq. 
America changed. 
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was with a kicks in the butt sent back home. 
4 500 soldiers in Iraq have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to grab. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of the weak point of Bush. 
The person who will take his place, faces a huge task. 
USA. The financial collapse has left its mark on journalists: In the newspapers can be hit by the cuts. And many accuse the internet, "murderers" of the written press. 
Five hundred American journalists have been by the Pew Research Center on their situation and their mental control concerning the future consulted. 
Today, almost all journalists pessimistic what their future. 
Nevertheless, they said to the information on responsible people not really concerned about the general credibility. 
They do not feel as alone as before. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model, which was destroyed. 
The major problems from the Newsroom telling cuts, the area in which the editors work, the newspaper put together. 
It is a problem that has to be solved – the interviewten journalists – if you want to prevent that the traditional journalism, as the big audience it understands, not much is disappearing. 
A clear, but more complicated pessimism is the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and executive Seniors of the written press are of the opinion that the journalism at national level on the wrong track. 
In the local area is it in the Executives even to the 65%. 
Print vs. broadcast. 
It is not difficult for the journalists, imagine the direction that the web. 
The most important publishing groups pave the way to the Internet, which by many as the "killer" of the printing press is seen. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists felt, is increased by up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewten journalists have admittedly, the new technology to want to join in the hope "they express something positive for the journalism". 
The biggest rift in American journalism today between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters that the working for them. 
56% of the editors at national level are certain, their reporters share their values with them, while it at a local level only 23%. 
Some think it has with the "safety in the work" to do. 
The managers, worried that their work within three years to lose $47% at national level. 
The journalists are it 30%. 
The issue of "safe work" in the team (our editors', Anm. d. Red.) is in the United States is always a topical issue. 
Only 13% of the journalists to work under contract. 
In a vast nation, as it is the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV-Sendern and Internet operators offer the employer as it pleases them and so it will be a question of take it or leave it. 
The editors have very often very high wages, the editor, however, can sometimes get only 10, 000 euros per month, pension and insurance funds. 
What the holiday, the issue is complex: A certain amount of days in the first year, and so many after the third, finally, after a number of years to achieve 15 vacation days. 
But the American journalists are, as they themselves admit, in the course of the year often "sick". 
It is a question of the climate. 
UNIPOL: Court in ROME: DANILO COPPOLA remains GROTTAFERRATA should IN 
The President of the second criminal division of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the Immobilienmaklers. This asked to, of Grottaferrata moved to Rome to be. 
It is against Coppola because Bankrot within the framework of the investigation into the against agreement in the case of the adoption of Unipol-Bnl. identified. 
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, was his release from house arrest in a residence duty in Grottaferrata converted. 
His lawyers and Michele Gentiloni Gaetano Pecorella had requested, the real estate broker to permit, from the provincial town in an apartment in the capital to be moved. 
According to the Court, he could such Verlegungen (against what the public prosecutor very had), to influence and its society anklagendes evidence to him. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already revealed a few days ago, as the House of Representatives against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket agreed by the White House: A large part of the Americans was and is more interested in the Wall Street rather than punish the economy to save. 
This confirmed yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported that, as the crisis over step the Republican party divide, severing the increasingly in their old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which has always been the public institutions and the business community and those favoured neo-conservative, the "those in Washington," and the world of finance and other hostile to primarily in the south, and the centre of the states voters wins. 
This part of the party primarily owes his rise to the voice of the I mentioned above. 
This aforementioned example, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake or even already announced: Not only in the United States, even in the entire West, and perhaps, on this also affected by this. 
In both states, as well as the crisis in Europe seems the long feared events to speed up the under these new conditions are finally taking shape to accept and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact, the crisis means a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links to the outside world and, at the same time, a huge amount of assets managed by private households, live in a single state. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: Namely as it with the affected families need to act, what an enormous voters mass. 
The crisis is global so economically, politically, on the other hand, is it almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to be sidelined in his right to speak to have lost: The obvious proof has been given by the EU, which because of their division into different national and international conflicts, a common way to find White. 
Therefore, all now count with the intrusion of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and primarily a). Distribution of aid: Since the crisis was ever more serious are the United States on the economic situation without foreign aid to save. 
And in addition to the funds also have the legitimacy to use those: Thus two cannot be value at the end of conditions in certain circumstances – – in what otherwise no international organisation and not a market can use in a similar way. 
The new emphasis on the staatlich-nationale element, is in perfectly compatible with the ever-increasing importance, the recently in the economy with a closely associated related sector: The territoriality. 
It is now very stark way than we so convinced, were long in a networked overall rich to be entered into an empire of the increasingly differentiated technologies, of the non-material that we suddenly see, as our future but more and more of the essential material things will depend, of water, harvest and oil. 
This can certainly all from one place to the other of the world will be transported, are nonetheless at extreme with a clearly defined piece of earth – a territory. 
So is the person on such a territory, a on others, in a crop yield, water unemployed or free area of oil is alive in the advantage. 
I now turn to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short way. 
Anyone who territory, who government, who policy says that say leadership. 
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand, there is the awareness of the need for Distinguished Leaderships, the need for someone who knows how it regulates. 
On the other hand, is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaders, including those primarily to the economy, which was as inadequate and full of shadow zones have explained. 
Moreover, a deeper far-reaching, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: A loss of confidence, a impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distance, all the a whole class of managers of Western countries. 
It seems the belief among large parts of the population to pave the way that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but their ideas world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, are, whose salary the majority always as foreign and outdated. 
The demand for leadership feeds so an elaborate underground storage but powerful movement of the removal of the political class and the traditional political establishment. This manifested itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and the sudden shift of the collective soul, state of the last time, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of American Members against Bush (and perhaps also plays the victory of the rights in Italy a role). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their observance, magazines, intellectuals, creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and thus less representative value of what nowadays in the bottom of the social strata of the West is going on and reinforced by the financial crisis and to Überdimensionalität driven. 
In view of all this, it would be purely exaggerated, of a "rebellion of mass" to speak. 
But the eyes wide open to keep, however, is certainly not. 
The Superkleber, which goes up to walls can 
The forces of gravity Klebstoffes to defeat thanks to a high and walls to climb as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems almost there is reached. 
With a on a surface area of only 2.5 qcm exasperated Kleber is the researchers have succeeded in a 100 kilos senkrechten bodies in an effort to fix. 
The studio – an American magazine has, the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory (TRL) published. 
The of the team of researchers imaginary material is a further development of the already glues used by a particular carbon structure, called Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"The principle of the Klebers is like a number to a pile of spaghetti tubes set to present," said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have from the feet are inspired the Geckos by mikroskopischen Härchen are covered, the animal a perfect halt. 
The with various materials like glass Schleifpapier Teflon and tests have shown that the new Kleber ten times more than the ability to think the feet of the reptiles and, at the same time, "can be easily removed from the wall," Liming Dai, researchers of the college of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
On walls along traveled? "This material could be used as a deciduous glue," Dai Liming is added. 
Just like Spiderman on walls emporzugehen? Perhaps already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefits, such as the combination of electrical equipment, because the Nanoröhrchen are as head of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of application in the field of space. 
For the moment, the super heroes must still wait. 
The other kind of research, including the University of Berkeley, California, is working on a new Kleberart. 
In an article of the American chemical Society present the Californian scientists a glue from the micro fibers like hair by movement on a surface clean by the dust and always maintain a perfect liability. 
Medicines: Never play with fruit juice 
Caution before Grapefruit-, Orangen- and apple juice. 
These drinks, because of their refreshing the quality and their vitamin wealth including consumed primarily in the summer, can cause serious health effects if it at the same time, with certain vital medicines are taken, since they affect the inclusion of this by the body can have in extreme way. 
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly on the risk verpackter like fresh fruit juices in conjunction with use of medicines. In the framework of the 236. Meetings of the American chemical Society in Philadelphia he once again proposed alarm: It only takes one glass Apfel-, Orangen- or Grapefruitsaft, the absorption of certain drugs to reduce as far as that they are virtually eliminated and the health of the patient. 
Grapefruitsaft was suspected to be responsible for, the effects of certain medicines such as antibiotics Antiasthmatika, heart cycle medicines anxiolytischer and neurological resources, up to toxic levels. 
Medicines should IN danger – For agency of the medicinal product had in a report two years ago doctors and patients about the risks of this Mixes warned, and stresses to ensure what in conjunction with resources such as Diazepan or Metadon drunk. 
It IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT restricted – According to the experts also include orange juice and apple juice substances can hamper the medicines. 
The list of of the fruit juice gehemmten active substances is long. 
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "These results are usually immediately to the various international manufacturer passed on which it so free to decide to change the consumer information. 
Therefore, it recommends, constantly to read the package leaflets and, if even ambiguities, to have no fear of a pharmacist or a doctor to ask, "stresses the expert from the Ansa-Agentur. 
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economic Nobel Prize is to the Americans Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. 
Of the 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, at the University of Princeton teaches and known for its regular article for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Economic and the Bush administration responded. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron-Zusammenbruchs, had Krugman in an editorial in the New York Times claims that this second event is crucial for the history of the United States as the attacks. 
A prediction that do not little controversy was the reply and the economist years later was offered, but today as absolutely right. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly the memories of the scandals in the framework of the collapse of Enron or WorldCom from the public field of vision disappeared," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank is Krugman a "economist of great value", but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration." 
Open Office, it seems the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package 
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software wins as the cost of free replacement for Microsoft's Office of an ever greater number of users, both at home and in the office, both among independent workers and in the public administration. 
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers by Sun Microsystems is monitored, presents the new Open Office with some new features, the audience: In addition to a revised and spartanischer were now at the beginning of menu, is a guaranteed to be compatible with the operating system Apples Mac os X achieved, and support for the new document format ODF (Open) 1.2 format, so the latest Standard-ISO version. 
Eight against was also at the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) by Open Office can be read. 
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that make it possible to the size of power to reduce checkpoint presentations, for example, to facilitate the sending via email. It also counts the possibility Grafikbearbeitungsmodule PDF files to import and at the same time, the original appearance of the side to maintain. 
It also is the "hybrid" PDF-Dateien generate what the typical graphic overview of the Adobe-Formats about the elements of a table and a text processing system. 
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: Tables mehrhändig can now be dealt with by various users, thereby avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the word processing system will each own officials assigned a Frabe, in order to guarantee a better correction procedure. 
Some firms are in the process of various functions of Open Office on the Internet to publish (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks, the final result is to be made public. 
The Italian version is at the following link to download available: Http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. follows it used to the English version, which is in the event since Friday. 
Ausser for Windows and Mac os is the programme for the Linux operating system available. 
At question is the Installations-CD send home or at the office. 
The cost of freedom cannot, however, an incentive for the spread of the programme in private households, it is also in the area of the business, where Open Office of the huge success could succeed: After all, are already various facilities of public administration and schools as Open Office. 
Indeed, there is not even a Trainings-Angebot what an optimal aid for small and medium-sized companies, and therefore even business prospects opened. 
Open Office is made up of five main components: Writer, this text the word producing Program; Calc, the tables Program, which aims at a displacement of spreadsheet; Impress, the production of presentations as with Power checkpoint; Dbase at the behest of databases in place of the better-known access; and finally draw an, a Grafikmodul. 
The objective for the year 2008 is it, 5 million downloads to achieve, an aim which already achieved in 3 million and 600 thousand easy can be exceeded. 
Mr Kohl also tested positive doping case and the fourth 
It has opened up a new doping spying case within the past Tour de France: It is the Austrian athletes Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, the T-shirts Drittklassifizierter and winner of the best Kletterers. 
The news published the newspaper L 'team on its Web site. 
The 26-jährige Kohl by the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth drivers, the positive for Cera, the third generation Epo tested. Before that has already met with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, as well as the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analysis from the blood samples of Kohl's are among those who, in the last weeks of the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry were made. 
Confirm the against the positive results on samples Cera, the Austrians will lose its third place and for two years of the race. 
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and, according to the Associated Press benachrichtige the Austrian. 
The 26-jährige Austrians rose behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the Americans on the podium Cadel Evans and also took up the jersey of the best Kletterers for themselves. 
Immigration: The NEW YORK Times asks: Is Italy racist? 
Italy, "the former country of emigrants, recently is one of the best countries for immigrants become ', which only with reluctance to be included. 
This is a sorry Belpaese a nation of racists? This is asking the New York Times in a long article in the issue of racism in Italy is devoted to and from the fall of the young, from Burkina Faso stämmigen Abdul William Guibre, a month ago in Milan after he was assassinated a packet of biscuits had prevention. 
The case is a sign of what the Times as "paradox of the North calls": The northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities", and yet "of the high degree of anti-immigrationistischen Sentiments and the greatest support of the Northern League is recorded." 
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants is relying on the Times further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only that. 
The new legislation put forward by the Lega against immigration and to accelerate the expulsion of illegal immigrants as a sign of change in Italy. 
A movement, which the Pope and the President of stress: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope during a meeting at the Quirinal a cooperation between church and state to combat racism." 
Students victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices 
The market for homes for students knows no crisis. 
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the tenants trade union, is a Einzelzimmer a students up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome cost. 
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious trains. Whole numbers of students so in fact lose their right to study, because their families are able to support them in this level", as the person in charge of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities is the great demand on the part of the students to a adulteration of the market, which has damaged the other inhabitants. 
Moreover, the majority of rental offers a series of offences: Free contracts, lack of registrations, without rental price limit, impromptu under rents. 
For the Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures, which in a review of the taxation to lower rental prices. 
On closer inspection of the inquiry, in Milan, a sleeping place in the quarter Brianza approximately EUR 450 needs; a Einzelzimmer begins with 650 euros (in the quarter gang Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera, or even EUR 900 in the quarter Vittoria. 
A sleeping place in Florence costs an average of 350 / 400 euro, a room 700. 
In Bologna, where the students in the quarters at the university, is 250 / 280 euros for a sleeping place needed, 370 to 500 for a Einzelzimmer. 
The prices are in Rome in the quarters at the Uni at about EUR 600 for a Einzelzimmer, 450 for a place in a sleep Doppelzimmer. 
Only a little deeper are the rents in the quarters at other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only those who in outskirts of skirting can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a Einzelzimmer in Prenestina, and similar quarters Centocelle. 
In Naples one 300-450 necessary for a sleeping place, for a room is the price of between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari costs a sleeping place 250-350 euro, a Einzelzimmer at least 350. 
In the smallest towns are the prices lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy. 
In the cities, in which the phenomenon of the hire of non-European students is more frequently, such as in Perugia, is even a further anomaly: A rents, about 25 to 30% above the average, foreign students. 
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. 
"A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face with no eyes." 
This image of the film director, Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what now in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces, is happening. 
The process of exclusion of the cinema, with the birth of the large multinational Chamber complex in the periphery, began to mean in the long term Einsaalkino death in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irreversibly, but also a cultural crime. 
Affected mostly historical sites are full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom you were a bit of emotion has come down," the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago the Oskar and the big price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and its nostalgia, what is it, in a good for ever lost cinema world. 
The figures, which the Standardisation -, the key industry association provides, speak a clear language: In the last five years have the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema must close; this bill paid the bulk of the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The worst affected regions are part of the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which the greatest number of this modern cinemas have been recorded, with 195 in the last 5 years leading the lists of Lombardy, 81 have it both in Tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has developed in an irrational way," Paolo Protti, the President of the Standardisation -, "it is useful to have new structures, but to come first, the preservation of already existing, for a room in the city, not all its habitués ready to replace the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery to visit. 
And here is still the lack of budget for the fund of the industry association äußer: The state recorded debt amounts to some EUR 10 million. 
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws. 
In order to maintain the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million per year by needs ". 
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which because of the fears about the old cinemas decided that this by an agreement between the community and to protect the Standardisation -; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional cinema and to support both in the historic centre, and in the periphery. 
Among the measures are also expected tax before divisions for the cinema operators, and the benefits for the audience on the transport: It will be permitted in the verkehrslimitierten areas of the centre and also to travel to lower parking fees to park. 
"It is a welcome initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and, moreover, still new concepts design. 
But we also need a better Audio- and video equipment, against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle something to do, after all, is the audience of more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is for me has always been an important issue: The closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the tipping point of me got, the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" to base, even if I have for 10 years ago with the idea had played. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I on the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale over agree, where I saw so many different emotions, drehe I me to the side, not the staubbedeckten posters to see. 
The links between politics and the 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to the decisions of the municipality of the interests of the mafia group Piromalli adapt. 
The accusations of the bar of the Antimafia-Behörde Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone the community Gioia Tauro this morning because involvement in mafia shops have been imprisoned are serious. 
It was also taken in handcuffs Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the lawyer, what the same name as the boss of the clans, was already because of involvement in criminal organisations of the mafia has been condemned, then to a compensation sum of EUR 10 million. 
"Any sort of moral and legal standard missachtend," write the lawyers, "had the two local authorities decided to the lawyer Piromalli money to pay for advisory activities." 
"It was therefore the mafia group made possible – so the judges – in any formal way in town halls and enter the policy of public administration of co-determination." 
The President of the Regional Committee Kalabriens Agazio Loiero not deny that it in his region "anything other than an exception is on links from local administrations and the organised crime. '" There are places in which the concentration of the mafia is larger than in other, in which such links are virtually inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians, the pressure from the 'Ndrangheta resist: Heroes who received a perfect. " 
The arrests of this morning follow those last July, with what, according to the police in the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of the last April was the local council Gioia Tauro dissolved by been, but back in 1991, and then – because of alleged links between organised crime and the local administration – were the local politicians have been removed from their town councils. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, who was then the mayor of the UDC is after the runoff from May 2006 on the head of the centre right coalition elected. 
He shrieked scandal as the police ordered the dissolution of the City Council. 
He belangte out in the Marco Minniti Vizeinnenminister he suspected that everything from politico-strategic reasons to have invented. The judges but say in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the risky Piromalli-Clan it even had to request a change of A3-Projektes. 
From a Abhöraktion in connection with the research on the case Dal Torrione, has demonstrated the willingness to accommodate the wishes of a businessman, it is well known that a representative of the large group at the Piromalli is the action of the public administration identical to the interests of this clans have been. " 
If the energy from the waves springs suddenly run the Great on 
It is a source of money versiegende, what about 70% of the surface of the planet and it is only now that the big energy companies seem to understand the world. 
Waves, tides and currents are the new renewable energy sources at all times, and also seek to occupy, such giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win, is already in account for 70 years and studied; it is no coincidence that intensified these studies since the first oil crisis, considerably. 
As the price of oil by 1980 vergas caved to the idea of marine energy, but now urge the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world long energy needs from the energy produced by the ocean waves could be met. 
This would be the as much honey as the current energy produced by nuclear power stations. 
Moreover, would be added the currents and tides. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first firm, which is now on the marine energy, is Enersis that in 2005, a treaty for the construction of a power station in the north of Portugal has signed. 
As the news was published it seemed a revolutionary step to act. 
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector, which for the marine energy production. 
"Chevron analyses these technologies", the spokesman of the American giant well-known company in the Wall Street Journal – and compensate the possibility is to cooperate with us. " 
This is the creation of an authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which deserves a project off the coast of Alaska to start. 
This is not to be underestimated as a sign that things primarily when you consider that it is still in Alaska oil would be supported by the United States and President Bush recently even the plans for new Bohrungen set in motion. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to invest in the new industry; the details are not known, but so are talking observers from a rising interest. 
Even improvement dignified technologies. 
Experts speak of a still at the start, when technology, not least because there is not the last doubt from the environmentalists are resolved. 
So far, there are projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland seem rather minor dimension and no serious environmental problems to cause. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, is technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, is using a system of interlinked Bojen. 
The burst of the waves, which has moved on and rain Bojen, within the swimmer Kolben hat on and in hydraulic pressure converted. 
This is forcing a Turbine, which in turn is a generator. 
The electricity is out on underwater pipelines sent to the coast. 
Until now, there are four planned investment of this kind, which only to wait for the government approval. A part of its energy could also be used for military facilities. 
Verdant power produced energy, however, were already for a department store and through a Parklatz unterseeischer turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water movements during the tidal forces the turbines, which by the burgeoning Drehbewegung the surreal generator. 
According to the Verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources. 
Only the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest deserves, according to the Institute for power generation research for the moment, the potential, which is in the tides. 
Although it also an irregular phenomenon, but the tides are more unpredictable than wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore look like a more reliable source of electricity. 
It is precisely the tidal energy is what federal states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have already $7.5 million in 2008 – to invest for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned.
