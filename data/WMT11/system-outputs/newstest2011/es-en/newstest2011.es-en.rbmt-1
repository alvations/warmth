What is counted? The ČSSD in the Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new councilmen of the ČSSD in the capital are going to have to surpass, according to seems, evident the linguistic barriers so that the components of the Meeting of the Prague and the municipal Council understand to his renewed companions of the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period "slang examined" to the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to verify its knowledge of the noticeable language that has arisen years in the Council in the last, when the present members of the coalition governed the Prague.
The codified dictionary that used the flower and political cream of the Prague during the previous period, of mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the characters, situations and causes more known the metropolis.
Surprising, it has been verified that the new councilmen almost do not understand those well-known concepts.
At least, so they say.
"Who is Voldemort"
"The truth is that I do not know it."
"Rather I am a novice in the praguense policy," affirmed during the examination of terminology of "colegueo" the councilman of culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And with regard to the political veteran, equal Karel Březina reacted.
Perhaps they know the concept "hole golf."
"Possibly it is the only expression of which you asked to me that use from time to time."
"If no, normally nonuse slang."
Of the glossary, whose definitions the past published the Aktuálně.cz newspaper June before the congress of voting of the ODS, the writing chose six examples, in particular those that especially are related to the municipal authorities of the Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort," "major hole of golf of the Prague," "to go to the pastry shop," "nape of the neck of bull," "treason of the capital" and "to armor."
Three councilmen accepted to be put under the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, that in future will be responsible for the education in the Prague, at the outset acceded, but it did not return to take the telephone.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do it.
"I do not put in these things nor fodder to value how the democrats amuse themselves civic."
"What yes it matters to me is how we will be understood in the execution of our programs," it indicated.
Since he has seen himself, supposedly councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized of which the previous title is an expression on an influential entrepreneur and a friend of exalcalde Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything to him\; the only term that guessed right in the examination is "the hole of greater golf of the Prague."
"One is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, that it adds immediately: "But rather I know it by the news."
"I am going away to have to aim at a course of languages," it jokes.
Karel Březina is not unique that recognizes in the hole of golf the Blanka tunnel, but also the councilman of Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Later, both sociodemócratas know who is really Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character\; in addition, it suspects the meaning "to go to the pastry shop."
"I believe that it means to go to a company of the Prague"\; soon one keeps awake to Plachý that is the headquarters of the companies of Janoušek.
Like Březina, indicates that such the knowledge obtained them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, between the sociodemócratas any so familiar glossary of colloquial terms does not exist.
"I asked my companions, but really it seems that we do not have anything similar."
"Rather, between us we used nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we match of words with the names," says the president of the praguense ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whose companions of party call Hulda.
"In the school they called Bříza to me, but I do not know if my companions also call to me thus," he confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper put the name on approval and works.
For its companions of party, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom deceits were associated before the elections during the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname of "Igráček" ("playmobil") on the part of some of its companions.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the sociodemócratas tolerate in the speech within the party.
To Hulínský it does not like that they call Hulda to him, but the Aktuálně.cz newspaper even discovered other nicknames for this praguense president.
"The doctor of the rights of the clubs" according to seems remembers that Petr Hulínský obtained its doctorate in Right in the academy of police of Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "sorceresses," according to published in a pamphlet
The considered women as sorceresses in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
Usually they have an age outpost, cannot work, for example, for reasons of health, they are unmarried and they do not have children.
The women who "become" sorceresses are sent to an isolated zone, so that they do not harm to the rest of the town.
"The men rarely undergo such but."
"One either does not isolate the healthy young women, because they help in the workings and they have children," a nun explains who, in the State Capital of western Africa Burkina Faso takes care in a special residence of than one hundred women expelled more from her communities.
The local Government has decided to be against to this unusual "social measurement."
It emitted an informative pamphlet that would have to contribute to avoid the witch hunt.
Nevertheless, this has one beats.
"More of 70% of the adults in Burkina Faso it does not know to read," warns in writing the Die newspaper Standard on the disadvantages of the sensitization.
The witchcraft accusations are also common in other African countries.
In Desire, neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the past week died Ammy Hemmah, of 72 years, when three women and two men tortured it, covered it with gasoline and they burned it.
The news appeared in BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION.
The authors affirm that she was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman catch oned in the oil that is used for the ritual unctions.
One catch oned in flames when the group wanted "to expel the bad spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "sorceresses" people of all the educative levels support it.
The Der newspaper Standard mentioned an entrepreneur of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The all-consuming ones of human souls always represented a danger," it affirmed.
Whereas in Burkina Faso the Government tries to calm the witch hunt, in Gambia the past year still participated in her the president.
"Gambian president Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, sent an ample hunting of the sorceresses whom, supposedly, been they had related to his death and they had tried to kill to the own president by means of the black magic."
"To help him it brought to shamans of near Guinea that, protected by police, the military and the personal escort of the president, took to the force to men and chosen women randomly enter the Gambian towns the property of the president Kanilai," indicates in her report the organization Amnesty International.
In the property, the arrested people had to drink a potion of grass with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, brought about intestinal and renal problems to them.
Two of the arrested ones did not survive the stay in the property.
After the international pressure, finally they released to around thousand lengthy people.
The renter of Bakala: he warms up themselves with coal stoves and he signs a higher rent
The man, elderly and strong, crossed the doors of the center of attention to the client of company RPG Byty of the "tycoon of the coal" Zdeňek Bakala, the deprived propietary major of floors in rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm it documented some with new contracts of rent of three floors: his, the one of its daughter and the one of its son, who is fulfilling sentence.
To the three it finishes to them pillaging the liberalization of the rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns to the month, the son will pay as of the next year 4,100 crowns by a floor of two stays with separated kitchen of second category.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid propellent boiler," shows with the finger the man in the new contract of his son, on whose signature he has plenary sessions powers.
"But I signed it," it explains average angry, average resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, that described the new "incorrect and indecent" conditions of rent like, recommends the renters who do not sign the new contracts and that hope until the 7 of December, date in which envelope will publish a guide having informed how to come in these cases.
But, before this, the man only makes a gesture.
"Everyone says a thing," it says with bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great research laboratory of the liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the great majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were until the moment under a regulated rent.
For that reason, Aktuálně.cz was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The mining waiting room of RPG is one of the four of Ostrava and, Tuesday to nine, already was full.
Just next to the doors they are the guards of security and to its side a machine to take number.
"Rent 2011," it can be read in a luminous button of his touch screen.
When pressing it, it leaves the machine a slip of paper with a number.
It almost does not give time nor to read "157" and or the number appears in the great screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the tail.
Shortly after, an elderly marriage gets to ask, but the crowd of the room is not in favor here of the new rents.
The majority of people comes to solve habitual problems, like formerly: requests of adjustments, similar questions of the insurance and subjects.
The letters with new contracts of rent will arrive in Ostrava at the mailboxes of the renters of the majority of the 44,000 floors pertaining to RPG around half-full from November.
RPG Byty proposes in letters an increase to them of the rent among the 15 and 38%.
The 18 of November in center open a special window of attention to the client for the new rents.
"It takes working one week, so it is beginning," they respond, after doubting briefly, the workers who are in her when the client appears like journalist.
The liberalization and the old floors for miners of Bakala are the most delicate subjects in the zone.
Before the elections, already stop treated them and clear the vice-president of the Parliament, original of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now appears continuously in newspapers of the zone.
"Twenty years later I want a new ground."
"Nor they changed the damn plate to me of the bath," is relieved the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than nothing rejoiced to verify if they receive a discount in the rent if they sign in time, as it promises the special supply of RPG.
The remaining renters will also receive half of the discount on the February rent who sign the new contract before the 15 of December.
However, the window of the "mining liberalization" without a doubt does not manage to dissipate the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 clients who were here yesterday, they only asked for the rent in 2011 around forty or fifty people," considers the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes in the Web and its planks to realize individual meetings on contracts when it is necessary.
If the two parts do not reach an agreement on the rent, it will have to solve the question an independent judge.
"One is not about a threat, but information on the only way of coming completely possible and according to the law," warns RPG in their pages.
"Here one is not going away to judge to anybody," thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is in the street against the center of attention the client gives him, at least partly, the reason.
"Receipt a pension of 13,000 and I have left 5,000 for the food\; I do not have means to go to the courts," it affirms.
But, immediately, the employee seeds the doubt.
"We will already see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns to them in means that they do not sign perhaps, so people hope," thinks.
The regulation of the rent will stop existing in the majority from the Czech Republic at beginnings of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The present rents still cover not even the necessary quantities for the maintenance with the bottom of the community," it remembers Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that adds that neglected the state of the bottom of the community that gets upset the renters is, for the proprietors, the main reason to increase the rent.
Whereas during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG it could with the rents invest in apartments four billions, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the number it will increase to 5,200 million.
The great screen that hangs of the ceiling, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase of the rent in 2011 in a 15% and less is applied to 31,200 apartments, that is to say, more of 90% of the RPG properties."
"In addition, always it will be at the most 7.50 monthly Czech crowns by squared meter," is indicated in the screen.
Only increase in a 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, one is an increase from some extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns by squared meter," indicates RPG.
In 2.600 floors, the rent will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect of blow to the rents, but it will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will again invest all the money of the ascent of the rent (it consults the graph) in the floors, mainly in saving in heating: new windows and heating.
The people will have priority who sign the agreement of rent ascent.
The architects have understood that the offices also need day-care center
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
Nobody would say that the own thing to such facilities also stashes in its interior a small day-care center yet: walls of colors, creative furniture and even a park in miniature in the outer terrace.
From October of the last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can go to her.
The company of architectonic projects Arch.Design, whose study they left numerous buildings known Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building about including a space for its miniday-care center.
In the company they work around 90 people, mainly in the age of baby boom and wanted to allow that the architects and draftsmen could return soon to the work after the maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the day-care center is one of the benefits that Arch.Design within the framework offers to its workers of its social program.
The constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The miniday-care center was an idea of the own employees of Arch.Designu and, with the support of the direction, they managed to obtain financing of the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The miniday-care center of the company within the framework funds through European Social Bottom of the operative Program of human resources and use, as well as of the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the granted financing (a grant of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they could buy the equipment and, after two years, engage to qualified personnel and services.
When it exhausts the financing (two years), the Arch.Design company has the obligation to maintain in operation the miniday-care center with its own bottoms during three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and in the presentation of the financing request it contributed the Economy company Rating.
The attention of the children is in the hands of qualified personnel\; in addition, a nurse and a professor of the Ministry of Education are present all the day for their cares. The day-care center at the moment welcomes in children without age limit, although the majority of them is less than three years old.
Since one is a "miniday-care center," it only can welcome at the same time as a maximum of five children, although with the turns they go more during the day.
The operation of the day-care center is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all the workers have the same right to use the day-care center, independent of the hierarchy within the company.
Although one is an education and individual cares, the contents of the program of the miniday-care center are comparable to the program of habitual pre-school education.
In her the children not only play, but they also receive a quality education: from the basic learning to the preparation for the school, they teach to English.
The class not only has of table toys and games, but also a computer to the children.
The presence of small children in the own company to create a friendly and positive atmosphere.
The parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid stress to behind schedule gather the children of the school when he is far from his place of work.
Thus, the parents are more productive while they work.
It is not surprising that this generates of natural form a relation of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is placed between the companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, really, this program reinforced the personnel marketing.
The house of the bones continues fascinating after 100 years. They observe the interiors of Gaudí
The tile roof seems the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remember to the column of a dinosaur and the balconies seem the mouth of an open fish.
Thus it is the Batlló House, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to their form similar to a skeleton, the premises nicknamed it "the house of the bones."
Its organic forms, its showy colors, the novel use of the stone, the tile fragments and mosaics, a facade that remembers to the grudges and the omnipresent smoothly curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with oníricas lines, delicate colors and textures removed from the nature and the fauna.
Paying more attention, it is observed a certain geometry, rate and a carefully thought order.
At night, all the facade of the house seems still more impressive, since she is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors improves.
It winds and the torsion of the forms continues to us also surprising in its interior.
The wavy wood copies the marks of the windows, the railings, the adornments of the doors, the peepholes and the signboards.
The Batlló House, that is in the district of Eixample in number 43 of the animated commercial street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of a house of year 1877 of architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and beginning of zero, but soon he accepted the idea of Gaudí to realize a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
Nevertheless, the Batlló House, formed by diverse apartments, did not only design it Antoni Gaudí.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their planes of the project adornments for the representative apartment arose from the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Milá House and the park Güell de Gaudí, in which are other pieces of the same.
Due to their organic form, the premises shortly after their conclusion nicknamed it "the house of the bones."
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening of the windows began to call it "the house of the yawns."
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, it appears the sword of San Jorge, landlord of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction stash religious reasons.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with vents of ventilation and the typical chimneys.
Its inclination can be strange from forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí absolutely did not respect the norms of construction of the moment and it was not let influence by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in him the data indicated on the predicted reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, to its conclusion, the city council remained hit so with the result that asked that it was corrected.
It bothered to him, for example, that the construction even included columns until the public sidewalk.
The adjustments never were realized, rather on the contrary: only fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló asked for (and he obtained) permission to both rent higher floors of the building.
In the floors inferiors the own proprietor settled.
In the gallery of the second floor was the hall and in the third floor the dormitories and the deprived part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry shop.
The house, of six floors, completely is crossed by stairs that take until the terrace of the tile roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and air lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection of the space.
The common part can be connected completely opening the doors of the halls and a greater group can be communicated in this way without problems, without it gives up to the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual tile roof and two additional floors.
It is impressive also how Gaudí with the light plays, white and blue tiles that cover the inner patio and skylights.
The game with both colors contributes the maximum of light in all the floors of the house.
One was based simply on the principle that the target reflects more light than the dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sun rays.
Any person can visit the Batlló House, that in year 2005 was added to the list of world-wide patrimony of the humanity of UNESCO.
In first stage of the house is more the most extensive apartment and recharged of the accessible ones the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of 150º anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or they discovered, that one is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common zone and the attic, including the terrace of the tile roof.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, reaches the 16.50 Euros, although the students, the pensioners and the holders of tourist cards obtain a 20% of discount.
The amount considerably surpasses the price of the entrance of other constructions of Gaudí in the city.
If he wants to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed his towers of lizard, friend would have to become quickly of some resident of the neighboring houses and to visit to him at home.
How one chooses the mattress and somier: the women and the men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed\; what it really confers his quality to a good bed is the surface to ease up, that is to say, the mattress and somier.
First of all they must be complemented perfectly so that they adapt the concrete users.
During the election elements enter game numerous, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
Also the type is important from interior in which he is placed the mattress and somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that usually does not have heating, latex mattresses do not have to be used because "they are warmed up more slowly."
In addition, usually they weigh considerably more than the habitual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to give the return more frequently them.
If the channels of the center do not air properly and, superficially, they are on a firm base, they maintain the humidity inside. It even can appear mould underneath.
At the time of choosing a bed, they also influence the customs.
Who has spent long time abroad, often she uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems to feel in a lower surface and lasts well.
"Almost all the players of hockey who returned from the NHL complained which here they did not sleep equal of good."
"For his crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer viscoelástica."
"This type of mattresses also recommends himself for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, reason why receive bad the information of the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, that specializes in the quilted furniture.
Many players of hockey, like other clients, take to time preferring the viscoelástica mattresses.
"Today no longer there is problem, because they have these suitable Italian Tempur and the Magniflex, but also the Tropical Czech brand."
No longer it is necessary to be a player of the NHL to be able to appreciate the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" works of a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and it forms based on the absorbed heat or one adapts to its corporal heat.
Nothing exerts pressure\; during the night, it will not give returns like after a divided duro.
Simply, one falls asleep better.
The viscoelástica also works as protection against the sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, adds to its height the length of its feet, that is to say, between 21 and 34 cm.
An O-Man woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed among 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person would have to be, in a double room, of 90 cm, altogether 180 cm.
In the case of the single rooms, for example of unmarried, it is recommended like minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit also is comfortable.
"If no, a simple norm can be applied to calculate the width: when easing up mouth arrives, must have the comfortably timid hands towards the elbows," it advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert of Cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, that already it has been many years taking care of the problematic one of the healthful dream and the ergonomics of the furniture, subject that teaches in the specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own one to somier and mattress, so during the purchase it is necessary to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
On the contrary, it will be necessary to mount somieres to different heights, which not always is possible in all the beds.
The foam mattresses must have a minimum altitude of 14 cm, the models with interior of wharves a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter are for the layer that adapts to the forms and smooths.
"When touching it with the hand or when complying in the mattress, without a doubt the wharves would not have to notice," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a type of somier certain.
The completely quilted dormitories, in which the mattress and the base are like Siameses, do not have sense in the dormitory.
The mattresses breathe bad and its cover cannot be washed, which today is made often.
And, since every night we transpire between 0.2 and 0.75 ls of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remember us to a great (and congested) sieve.
Therefore, the specialists reject the catchphrases that speak of a life of the mattress of up to 25 years or, even, of a guarantee of by life.
Nevertheless, everything has but.
For that reason, the salesmen give an advice: in the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care carefully of the cleaning and the washing of the cover, but better year a mattress protector that can be retired and be washed easily.
Although at the moment covers of mattresses with rack closing make in all their perimeter, reason why when opening they remain them in two parts (something very important for the washing and the size of the washing machine), its manipulation in the larger models (and by a single person) when rising the mattress can seem a fight between a weight fly and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of somier, it has a firm table?
Never!
At the most for the thought beds so that they pass one night the visits.
Nevertheless, it must make (if you do not have them already) airing holes in the table and must be used with a mattress with wharves in the interior and a minimum altitude of 15 cm with the wharves in bags (as the Taschenfederkern German) and a soft layer.
The polyurethane mattresses do not have to be used on such bases.
For somieres of nonarticulables laminae and that contains between 14 and 18 laminae, mattresses of latex or mattresses can be used sandwich (for example, a latex combination and fiber of the Coco), although always is better to somier with a greater number of laminae, 28 or more, in those than laminae of the lumbar zone they are reinforced and its rigidity can be regulated.
Somieres of articulables laminae does not have to be used with a mattress of wharves, since it does not react to the reclinación.
Besides the adjustment of the rigidity of laminae, the shoulder protection can also be used.
One is a special fixation of the laminae that allows to press or, even, to incline laminae in such a way that "they surround perfectly" to shoulders during the dream.
For the men who have some very wide shoulders, one is something very important.
The manufacturers of mattresses even remember them that, in the "masculine ones," they began to indeed use a softer zone around shoulders.
Also they remember the women, for who they put a softer zone around the hips.
For the most demanding clients, they exist somieres with structure in cross or of small boards with the call damping multitorsion.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension stoops.
It must also consider that, although uses the mattress and somier suitable, if it uses a bad pillow (great and "fluffy"), the majority of the advantages will disappear.
The basic norm is simple: the pillow must maintain the head and the corners only can arrive until shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is of 50 xs 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When easing up of side, the pillow must be at the same level (when reinforcement for shoulders or the softest zone of the mattress is combined with somier with) that the height of shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something to see, according to seems, with the stuffed original straw mattresses.
The manufacturers continue using, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, the biological mattresses are fashionable.
The raw materials with petroleum, with which the polyurethane foam makes, fill up with natural oils, for example of castor bean or soybean.
In fact, practically all the well-known manufacturers use soybean.
"Biological, in the case of the mattresses, it means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," Petr Vašíček of the Tropico company explains Extra.
Also, natural substances during the manufacture of the cover of the mattresses, one of the first aloe side are used.
But also it is possible to be decided on the microcapsules, that release to a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
Differences for men and women also exist.
Whereas the men "refresh" with vegetal breeze extracts, so that the cover of the mattress absorbs the heat and refreshes the body, the women prefer "to warm up" the cover.
The extract of red pepper improves the circulation of the blood, so that the women feel more warmth.
The favorites at the moment?
The made cold foam mattresses, that are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, which causes that they are more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of diverse cold and viscoelástica foam rigidities allows to make mattresses of diverse zones that know perfectly where it goes the head, shoulders and the heels.
A mattress of good quality will cost to him of seven thousand crowns for above.
Those that performs a therapeutic function usually have a IVA inferior, since they are considered like average toilets.
The first that it obtained this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It turns out complicated to save in the mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes the supplies of the manufacturers or salesmen can be approved, who sometimes offer two mattresses by the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a foam with Memory memory adhered to the cover by 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of the viscoelástica with an open cellular structure and a great density began with "the cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially it arose like material for the NASA, because during the takeoffs praises astronauts they were put under an enormous overload.
Tempur softens with the heat and it becomes hardened with the cold.
Therefore, the human, warm body, exerts a perfect effect and adapts its pressure optimally.
Therefore, he is ideal to avoid that sores take place, although also to improve the comfort during the dream.
The viscoelástica foam not only is used in the mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and they alleviate them, as well as its circulation.
The national manufacturers, for example, use the foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similars.
More and more parents use devices of pursuit of people to control their children
The fear by the children every time takes to more people to think about controlling to them by GPS.
The system, initially thought for the pursuit of vehicles, can also follow the movement of the people and thus contribute, for example, in case like the disappearance of the girl of nine years Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximated size of a box of matches, but soon it will be reduced to the size of a clock.
To much people it gave to fear the case him of the missing Anička and one began to inform on means available to protect better its children.
Even at the cost of invading its privacy.
"All we tried to say to us that one is not to spy, but of another means to diminish the possibilities that a tragedy takes place," considers Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of devices of pursuit in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, it is possible to be abused such devices, for example if they put in the purse of somebody without its knowledge, but not yet we have run into with such cases."
"The majority of the clients really buys it for reasons of security," adds Pilin.
In their opinion, the children always would have to know why he serves the "small box" and how he is used in case of emergency.
The infantile psychologist Dana Bočková notices on the fact that, if the boy does not want to take it, simply she will throw it.
"The smallest children Even show great creativity at the time of losing certain things deliberately if they want to avoid that they control to them."
"Before, the parents trusted the mobiles enormously, but these could be extinguished as easily as the pursuit device," affirms Bočková.
In his opinion, it is debatable if in case of attack such device is really useful.
"If preparation is a kidnapping, the author always will practically verify if the boy takes some type of electronics that can keep awake its location."
"Now it is the telephone."
"According to it is extended the use of the pursuit devices, also will look for them, since its sale without a doubt will be realized with much publicity."
"In such cases, the delinquents always go a passage in front of the police," says the psychologist.
Nevertheless, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, that as much offers services of pursuit for vehicles as for people, even in case, after an attack, is destroyed the pursuit device immediately, its presence can serve as aid.
"The device can be formed so that it regularly sends the position after a certain period."
"If it suffers damages, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person at issue."
"The most expensive devices take integrated an inclination measurer, reason why if the person simply slips and it remains immovable, the device will immediately emit a warning with the position at issue," affirms Čech.
In its opinion, a service of this type can even be obtained with the intelligent mobile phones with navigation, in which a special software only must settle.
The problem of the present units of pursuit is that at the moment it is devices with a size similar to a box of matches or the smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason tests at the moment with devices are being realized that seem a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage of which a possible aggressor perhaps does not identify the device."
"Or that identifies it after certain time, which can cause that the police gains time," adds.
Although the pursuit devices take in the wrist or hanging, they will continue using the same technology that is used for the pursuit of vehicles.
One is the verification of the position with a GPS system (that is used in habitual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the present position.
The army has sufficient wicks like surrounding all Czech Republic. But two years only last
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to catch explosives.
The past year the Ministry of Defense already added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of wick.
Therefore, they have existence for 225 years.
The problem is that the life utility of the wick is of two years, four at the most.
The army bought the wick for explosives to the STV Group, a. s. by forty million crowns.
The personnel of the General responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of a so enormous amount of wick saying that the soldiers need for the maneuvers formation 60 kilometers wick to the year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnicses of the army, with which one made contact MF DNES, it is decided nevertheless that, in such case, all the generals, officials of the High Command would have to also realize these maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not love exempt nor the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
Therefore it would only be possible to be justified that the army spends sixty kilometers of wick.
Such length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Although thus outside, the army would have sufficient existence for more than ten years.
Opposite S.A., as the experts say, for the initial formation of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would previously have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of special engineers or) indicated sufficient existence for the 225.
The soldiers of the brigade of fast intervention complained personally recently before Minister Vondra because they say that as soon as has the ammunition for diverse arms, reason why the practices of shot by money question are even limited.
And we do not speak on the lack of underwear.
"I either do not manage to understand that they buy such amounts to us of wick repeatedly."
"But it is its decision and, without a doubt, they will know why they act thus."
"For us, the army is a good client to whom, like company, we tried to satisfy," it admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defense Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick also saying that she will have existence of this "ammunition" like minimum for ten years.
Nevertheless, Jan Děcký, of STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a life utility of four years and, in the case of products pyrotechnicses for the army or the police, of two years.
"If it is stored in some perfect conditions, can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, by the possible critics of the army, do not want to give their name.
After the conclusion of its life utility, each ammunition must be verified carefully to see if it continues being trustworthy and it does not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not gratuitous and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, obtained a discount.
"A 60% cost to Us less than the order of the year last of 244 kilometers," indicates the Pejšek spokesman of the center of purchases of the Ministry of Defense.
To only compare: the annual consumption of wick of the pyrotechnicses of the police, that eliminate the ammunition of World War II or the left one by the Soviet army, already does not surpass for years the 1,500 meters.
In addition, the police always requests only the right amount like run out the ammunition before its life utility finishes.
They decided it for reasons of security for the pyrotechnicses and, in addition, meanwhile more modern and trustworthy types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already knows clearly difficulties to finish tens of thousands of tons of the ammunition of the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand people was prepared for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicses with which MF DNES spoke, after a pair of years the following problem with the present one will take place: it will be necessary to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, that is being bought now "cheap."
Until now itself living on the contacts that I obtained thanks to the contest
The fact to gain the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" helped to Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the tax exemptions of its hotel.
The last edition, gained the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" the entrepreneur of 28 years Lukáš Pytloun de Liberec.
Its history of success seems removed from a film.
To Lukáš Pytloun it enchanted to him to travel.
Abroad account occurred of which in Liberec it was necessary with effort quality lodging.
With the savings that reunited abroad with seasonal works and a credit of the bank it bought a house that half was demolished compound of five floors.
Considering that still studied his third year in the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the relation quality-price of the lodging in our zone impelled to me to do something on the matter," says Lukáš Pytloun.
It began to rent reconstructed first stage to foreign workers.
All the income that it obtained again invested them in the building, that gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it was little by little able to open in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all the categories of lodging.
Most comfortable of all it was, until recently, the hotel of design of four Pytloun stars.
Nevertheless, this year opened another one of the same quality.
"We finished signing a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our concept of tax exemption, and other people are showing interest by a tax exemption of Pytloun," she said to the entrepreneur number one of the past year.
"To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels the fact to a great extent helped to gain the contest of the "Entrepreneur of the year"," it adds thanked for Pytloun.
The victory as much increased to its fame and popularity in Liberec as in the environs.
"People recognized me by the street, still congratulated to me often and, I must say, that he was very pleasant," she remembers.
Without a doubt, it recommends to that wants to try some company that participates in the contest.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but the participation already is beneficial.
It affirms that, until the moment, it continues living on the known contacts and that, without the contest, it had perhaps not obtained.
"With some people who I knew thanks to the contest I have begun to collaborate habitually."
The fame associated to the success, in its opinion, also included in the employees,
altogether around seventy.
"I have seen that they show a greater loyalty and they are proud to participate in which obtained the general recognition."
"It is not, far from it, my own personal success, but it is the result of the duro work of all the equipment."
"Only that is my name the one that appears in first flat one," Lukáš Pytloun says today modestly.
successive him desire a calmer year del than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria by the victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the duro work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet already has passed the worse thing.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the contest of Vodafone "Company of the year," the year last in the "Slavic House" of the Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical factory into Česká Skalice in a signature with a volume of businesses of hundreds of million.
"I can say that the prize not only animated to me, but to all collaborators and it improved our confidence to fight against the competition," says the winner of the past year.
The history of the Farmet company begins with desire to do something useful.
For that reason, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žďárský the rent of a small factory as compensation by the embargo of properties during the Comunism, it did not doubt too much\; it resigned to his position in the company on which worked and, with a pair of companions, they founded the company with its father of plastic batteries.
Shortly after, they began to specialize in vegetal oil presses.
Eight years later became the manufacturing major of automatic presses of the center of Europe.
They also obtained a greater presence between the public nonspecialized after achieveing the success in the contest in mass media.
"Not only our clients began to consider to the Farmet brand like considerably better, but also the foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that achieved a greater success in its country," Karel Žďárský says.
Perhaps the past year was not in Farmet only a sample of the euphoria of the victory.
It also obtained recognition by the commercial results until year 2008 and, partially, from the 2009.
And exactly year 2009 was the year it last more for the machinery sale.
The worsening of the crisis, that had still not reached to so many citizens, caused that the companies stopped their projects of investment and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, evidently, did not get rid either of such situation."
"The income were reduced in a 40%, we had to limit the production and we even had some dismissals," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must, sometimes, adopt even little popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and they maintained the gains of the company, although it go at levels inferiors that before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not trim expenses was in the investigation and development.
"With the subsidys we have constructed a research center and formation, we reinforced the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent valuations in national fairs," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that already they have left the crisis behind.
The income return to increase and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new profit hopes that it contributes a victory feeling, but in a calmed atmosphere," indicates Karel Žďárský.
A survey that keeps awake the ridiculous norms
The survey of Absurdez of the year comprises by fourth time of the enterprise match.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous norms.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year went the obligation to document to the administration to which the civil servants can accede in line.
The decision adopted it more of a third of almost the four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of the social security requested an extract of the mercantile registry, although their civil servants can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of the social security no longer will request an extract of the mercantile registry when it carries out a control of the impositions of the insured," the spokeswoman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová declared.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year consists of consulting the norms and regulation that must respect the companies and entrepreneurs in Czech Republic and try that those are eliminated that are absurd.
This year forms by fourth time leaves from the enterprise match of the Hospodářské publication noviny and begins to also create liking between the general public.
Whereas the edition of the past year counted on the participation of three thousand voters, this year practically reached four the thousands.
And it is not surprising, since still we have legal obligations several very well that must be respected simply to deal.
"Perhaps in number of necessary papers for the declaration of taxes we are in the first place world-wide," comments Karel Havlíček of the Association of small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of the enterprise norms is a stated objective of all the governments.
Nevertheless, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, Czech Republic is placed in the position 74ª, that is to say, eight positions worse than the past year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was celebrated for the first time in 2006 and every year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdez every year between April and end of September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be realized in the www.firmaroku.cz webpage. Later, the organizer of the contest chooses to seven candidates for the "antiprize" and, during October, he allows that the public votes in Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It gains the absurdez that receives more votes.
For the survey of this year they appeared more than one hundred, in particular 105 norms and regulations that do not have sense.
The examples sent them as much entrepreneurs as professional associations and journalists.
Between the "finalists" of the contest it was placed, for example, the requirement of which the vehicles for the maintenance of the highways and freeways pay the toll or that the entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two baths paint every two years the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published in the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, that always is realized at beginnings of November in the place of Wenceslao of the Prague, comprises of an event in which usually they participate personalities of the political and social world.
This year, for example, they attended this act of the contest Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Camera of Commerce of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot stay if the State introduces ties to him to the entrepreneurs continuously, for that reason my objective consists of eliminating every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that at the moment complicate unnecessarily the commerce," Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek announced.
The efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not remain in water of borrajas.
In 2007, which more bothered people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with an advance from three days to the enterprise office of the zone of permanent operation, the intention to go with a position to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished secondly in number of votes in 2007, that is to say, the communication to the office of work on the part of its foreign workers of the business trips of up to 30 days, eliminated in the law of the call green card.
And to third the won one goes.
The Absurdez of year 2009 was the regulation for the physiotherapists to have in its consultation a great mirror, a refrigerator and two scales of ground.
For that reason, this year the Ministry of Health emitted a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes the responsible companies socially
The projects are valued ecological, humanitarian, educative or sport.
The newness in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodářské noviny is the called category Company responsible for year 2010.
The assignment of this contest consists of endorsing to the responsible and right companies.
"In this way we want to support to the companies that take care of the impact of their activity on the environment and which they endorse responsible activities socially," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the movable operator of the Vodafone company, sponsoring organizer and of the contest, as in the case of the contest of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special subcategory of the edition of this year of the main contest of Vodafone Company of year 2010 companies appeared for which the commercial success is not the only objective in the long term.
The history of each of them is inspiring and it would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between both, the common denominator is the support and the consideration that offer.
In a case, one is for example the disabled people, in others of the personal problems or of health of the employees.
Between the fourteen finalists of all the Republic it was placed, for example, the praguense company of software ET Netera, that endorses the formation of informal sport equipment between its workers, who later participate in matches of diverse sports.
Another example of company responsible for the zone of Pardubice is the Isolit-Brave company, that already has been seven years being the main aportador of bottoms to sponsor the disabled children.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery store that worries especially about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more of 70% of the group\; for that reason it received the title of Company responsible for the central zone of Czech Republic and in the Vodafone contest Company of the year it finished thirdly in the region.
In Olomouc it even gained the company of MiRyz accounting Soft, that reduced the labor schedule, below the average of 35 hours weekly, without reducing the wages.
The title also granted it because it primarily buys Czech manufacturers, it endorses the Community activities in the zone and respects the environment.
"We tried to recycle the possible maximum so that our activities of production and administration produce the smaller possible impact on the environment," the entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová explains.
The responsible company for YOU Enlogit of the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each portable one, it offered a chair and ergonomic keyboards to them\; in addition, it endorses the work from house and in his enterprise events it uses the services of catering of a protected company local.
"In addition, we endorsed the scholarship Person in hardships, who helps in particular the local romaní community," the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý comments.
Also they are placed in good place with a mention the company from Praní laundry to čištění of the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive advantages of a special way which they repel in its pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of the qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of the company of construction of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the region of Moravia-Silesian Voivodeship.
In the category of Company responsible for the year Company of the year was designated to all the regional finalists of the Vodafone contest automatically who responded to the questions of the inscription form and they sent it before the 15 of August to the organizers.
The organizers eliminated of the evaluation the forms that were not complete or erroneous.
"If the representatives of the companies offerers did not respond the questions, they could not participate in the contest of Company responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified of "the main" contest Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual candidacies for this contest are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the main contest of Company of the year," Karel Goldman of the consultant's office Bison &amp\; Rose explains.
The police realized arrests during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Bottom, in Pilsen
The police against the corruption in the last realized diverse arrests in the building of the Agricultural Bottom days.
The detectives handcuffed to a local entrepreneur of the sector of means and the real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
According to it seems, this one attempt to manipulate a public auction in course for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land received it precise interesting.
It had to pay for that reason to Luboš G. million crowns half.
"At the moment only I can say that the police looks for a person by bribe during a public auction and public licitation," the female leader of the general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená said to Právo, adding that at the moment cannot disclose more details on the investigation in course.
After twenty-four hours, the police loosen to the entrepreneur of 46 years.
On the way in which it could influence in the public auction, given little official information, can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman of the Agricultural Bottom Lubomíra Černá responded to the questions of Právo saying that the police really carried out the arrest in the headquarters of Pilsen and was during a public auction.
"One is a client, not of one of our workers," it needed.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for the presentation of proposals of land transference in accordance with the law on the Earth" and it is realized when they appear several stakeholders in relation to the offered land.
"These people, during the call, offer a value superior to the one of their restitution, that must be transferred before the value of the land announces."
"Based on the supplies, the order of the buyers is determined and, later, the Agricultural Bottom transfers the land to the person who offers the greater supply" explained the spokeswoman of the Bottom.
Luboš G. had information on whom went to present to call and, since simultaneously is interested person because she acquired diverse rights of restitution, proposed to the interested ones in the land that would not participate in the auction.
By such favor, it was acquiring a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, it had as much money above.
Luboš G. had special contacts of Pilsen at heart already for a long time.
It appeared in the cause of the old head of the PF Václav Sankot, that was accused to dispatch the land substitution for which already a construction decision had been emitted.
For example, Luboš G. finishes obtaining from the Bottom some lands anticipated for the construction of public infrastructures, in particular in the place where pole position would be due to construct to a great highway to the industrial zone of Borská.
Later, superior very changed them of very beneficial form with the magistrate by a house in the own historical center of the city with a value.
In this case, the city council had to take part because, on the contrary, the blocked lands would avoid the construction.
The families will have to pay some additional expenses of several hundreds of crowns to the month
The homes will have to pay from January not only by all the types of energy, but also by water and electricity, accessories by heating and, in some cases, rents majors.
Therefore, the families will have to remove from the portfolio, as of January, several hundreds of crowns to the month more than now.
The price of the electricity increases in a 4.6%, the gas around a 2%, in some cities they will have to pay more until a 10% by the water provision and many also increase the price of the central heating.
The ascent of the electricity for the families who live in apartments would have to promote to some 100 crowns more to the year than now.
Nevertheless, the main suppliers of electricity reduced the prices, because it is increasing the support to the production of energy of renewable sources, in particular the photovoltaic one.
Nevertheless, the gas get dearer moderately, especially at the moment at which the heating is used more and, therefore, major is the consumption.
In this case, they also must count with a pair of hundreds of crowns to the year more.
Whereas the electricity and the gas get dearer by all the country, the change of price of the central heating varies from a place to another one.
Price increase plans it mainly the greater municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January by the central heating some 50 crowns more to the month, whereas the families of Liberec pay more than 1,000 additional crowns to the year.
The residents in the Prague also will have to support to an increase of 9% of the price of the water and the heating, especially in case the city increases the rent of infrastructures.
If the rent does not vary, the praguenses will pay an additional 6.8%.
The prices in the Prague, nevertheless, will continue being between lowest of all the country.
In the north of Bohemianism, where the present prices are between highest, both rates will get dearer a 7.4%.
They can considerably increase the prices of the rent of 450,000 floors rented in the Prague, where the regulation will finalize in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, that it owns in Ústí nad Labem around 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January in to a 100%.
The company will take to the courts to those who are not in agreement with the new rent.
The regulated rents, that benefit to the residents from around 300,000 floors, could increase next year until a 10%.
The Czech young people drink with Fernet and rum. The beer no longer is of way, because it makes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys robbed its parents.
Those are the drinks that cause that young drinkers with an age finish in medical cares inferior to fifteen years.
The children who finish fallen down in the hospital continuously to surpass the undertow no longer are an exception.
This is derived from the experience of the doctors who are with such cases in the admissions of paediatrics of the hospital.
"To drink beer or it came no longer is fashionable, because they take much in boozing to them."
"Now the fashion is the strong spirits," indicates in center to Právo the head of paediatrics of the Hořovice Hospital of Bohemianism, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they manage to take a bottle to his father of the cupboard, it can be whiskey, but normally one is Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of which it is lightened with juice and of which it does not smell so much," explains.
The spokeswoman of the university Hospital Motol also confirms it, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, Fernet or rum usually is."
"Those are the modern spirits, in particular between the students."
"In some cases, they use brandy that took at home," it adds Jurinová.
According to the Pelikán head, they are thirteen drinkers and fourteen years those that are accustomed to appear in the hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where it works from this year, it worked during a decade in paediatrics in Motol, to where the ambulances took to the young people from the near zones.
"A girl had to perhaps enter four times."
"It began the twelve years, when they brought it with 3.5 of alcohol in blood, besides a mixture with ecstasy," indicates the doctor of the department on this case.
"One was in the fair of Holešovice in some celebration of dance."
"The interesting thing is that his mother nor it surprised to him that her daughter disappeared 48 hours," the head is surprised.
It is indeed the lack of interest of the parents or even its clear tolerance towards the drink on the part of its children the one that considers the main cause of the increase of the alcohol consumption between the young people.
The experts indicate that, in the case of the children, it is not possible to be spoken properly of dependancy.
"It is understood by alcoholic a person whom she has a chronic dependancy of the alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated to the same, which does not take place in children."
"In that they drink alcohol repeatedly, rather bankrupt is due systematically of social or familiar surroundings," explains the Pelikán head.
According to the Jurinová spokeswoman, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol they were hospitalized until half-full of November forty drunk children.
Nevertheless, the statistics only show those that go with a serious poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
The young drinkers who, after the traveling medical examination, go away to house with the parents or the police, do not count.
Besides the cases in that the children simply meet after the school and they drink brandy, for Pelikán three seasonal bumps exist that are possible to mention: the day of sorceresses, End Year and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstance, they drink by bad mark or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the vacations."
"In the day of the sorceresses I have gotten to see simultaneously in admissions up to seven drunk children," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who spend the night in chemical decontamination under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxicalally, they have the advantage of which on the following day do not undergo a terrible undertow at home.
The morning headache, brought about by the dehydration and the lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients that needs to the organism.
"These take it far better, because after the anxious night, they rise well and it does not hurt anything to them."
"They only are confused with respect to where they are," it indicates Pelikán, adding that, often, the patients lose the good humor at least when they see the expenses that they have generated.
The transfer in ambulance and the hospitalization in a room for serious patients gets to cost a ten of thousands of crowns.
"Often I have used the cost like means to educate to them, when in the visit I directly say them to the children how much its intoxication has cost and who they would have to spend all the summer in a work for young people so that you gained the sufficient thing to be pleased that night," it adds Pelikán.
Perhaps the health insurance, in its opinion like regressive measurement, that usually gives back to the people the expenses of the treatment, does not do it in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 airplanes are for the first time in other people's hands in Spain
Two L-159 airplanes of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the airplane House C-295M, divided Tuesday for Seville, where is the manufacturer of the airships House - EADS.
It is the first time that a device of this type is into the hands of whom it is not the Czech army.
At the moment, they only were abroad for realizing flights of practices or demonstration.
Two-seater L-159T1 is the version, that until the moment the Czech army used and that still was in state to fly.
The three remaining airplanes are the L-159 single-seater.
These still are conserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the Omnipol company, already was made position of them the past week.
Jan Peješk, of the department of defense press, indicates that still she does not know herself when the airplanes of Vodochody will physically retire.
"The single-seat airplanes L-159, however, were separated of the airplanes repaired a long time ago, without additional investments nor contributions on the part of the Ministry."
"Two-seater L-159T1 interchanged in their present state," it said to Právo Pejšek.
It added that the army does not remain without two-seater airplanes, since in May of 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract by a quantity of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for twos-seater.
One of the new airplanes already received it the army in July, the other will be given at the end of year.
According to Pejšek, EADS was committed to that the airplanes are added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"In the contract it is indicated clearly that the EADS company is the one that retires the L-159 airplanes and that will be used for the practices of pilots of countries of NATO."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how it is going to use them in this frame," it indicates Pejšek.
The Hospodářské newspaper noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The five interchange of L-159 by an airplane House and the purchase of other three airships by 3,500 million crowns was approved the year last through the government of Mirek Topolanek.
The Ministry of Defense did not summon a licitation for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The present direction of defense affirms that the interchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreigner.
The Czech army acquired to Aer 72 airships and it only uses 24, reason why it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of airplanes House possibly gets to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission already denounced to the Czech Ministry of Defense before the European Court of Justice because an European licitation would have to choose the airplanes realising and not putting themselves in contact with an only manufacturer.
The army already received three airplanes House and the last one would have to arrive at the praguense airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A forefinger longer than annulling indicates a risk under undergoing cancer more
The men who have the index longer than annulling are subject to a smaller risk of undergoing prostate cancer.
This one is the surprising conclusion of studied published Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could depend on the testosterone level, masculine hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can constitute a simple test of the risk of undergoing prostate cancer, in particular for the men with ages of up to 60 years," indicated the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for the investigation on the cancer in the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help to determine in particular what men would have to be put under a test of prostate cancer, if this characteristic goes associate to a genetic risk or other detrimental factors, like familiar problems of health, according to indicates Eeles.
During period 1994-2009, it realized the pursuit with a homologous Briton of more than 1,500 patients with cancer of prostate and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study it had the East Indian finger of the right hand shorter than annulling.
They presented the same probabilities of undergoing prostate cancer that 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of the men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced in a 33%\; after the men with ages inferiors to 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relation between the length of fingers both at issue, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones from which is exposed the fetus in the matrix.
A testosterone level inferior corresponds with a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that the testosterone influences in the development of the prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and old president of the Academy of Sciences, professor Václav Pačes, said to ČTK that knows the study, but that does not seem to him that the relation between the length of the fingers and the cancer can "be demonstrated completely."
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and the D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like the majority of Europe, dawned Thursday covered with snow.
The highways and sidewalks are main deck by compact snow and the machines snowplow circulated all night around numerous zones.
In the morning the D5 highway was closed between the kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, like the D1 in Brno in the direction of the Prague.
The news automotoklubu transmitted the operator of the Ústředního (ÚAMK).
In kilometer 91 a truck was damaged, in the 93 hit two industrial vehicles that caused wounded.
Also several tourism finished in the roadside ditch.
Problems in the D1 railcar also exist in kilometer 185 in the direction of the Prague.
There they hit two trucks.
The conductors must circulate slowly after Brno in kilometer 190 or cross Brno and get up themselves in kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
There cloggings of several kilometers have formed.
Also an accident in the D11 highway has taken place, just next to the Prague.
The Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 ºC.
Cloggings for example in Prosek are forming, although also it is congested Štěrboholská.
The means of transport more surely are the meter.
The street cars circulate late, for example in the line between náměstí Karlovo and Náměstí Míru.
To eight in the morning, another state of crisis in the Prague will take place.
The problems also affect to the railroads and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech company of railroads had to annul seven connections by three express.
The problems affect, for example, to the line between the Prague and Kralupy or the Prague and Beroun.
The travellers would have to verify which is the present situation.
The Ruzyně airport was closed at night from the eleven of Wednesday to the five in the morning.
At the moment, already it is possible to be circulated around the majority of the highways of the south of Moravia, but with extreme precaution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to the circulation, in Brněnska snow languages are forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to accede more to certain access roads to the elevated points.
One of the affected places more was Vyškovsko.
Until the moment the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
In order to clear milling machines will be required them.
At the moment it is not possible to be said when they will be opened to the circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution in the zone of the Bílé Karpaty is required (the Carpathians white).
The highways of the region that, since it is a natural zone protected, must simply be left in inert state, are accumulated up to five centimeters of snow, according to indicates ČTK.
In Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemianism, where the snow layer reaches the 18 centimeters.
In the region of Moravia-Silesian Voivodeship, they fell around 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowed ones send gradually in Czech Republic.
The American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, well-known at the moment only by the codified name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle influences in the local conflict with the talibans and that "it changes the progress of the game" made his victory.
The new arms are like a small pistol and with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets go off with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special-purpose ammunition of caliber of 25 mm created for this rifle and the elevated explosive charge that contain causes that in fact it works like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed so that they explode not only when they strike to the objective, but in any point that is in its ballistic trajectory.
They are possible to be used against the enemies who hide after an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Without a doubt, a normal protection cannot be used and, when it sends his killer metallic chip rain, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke on the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for infantry who uses "an intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the objective, they point at the same its ray laser, that determines the range, later obtains a precise front sight and, based on the same, he corrects the line of departure and he tightens the trigger."
"We say that 543 meters have been moderate."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon load and sends the projectile to a distance of 543 meters, more except one, two or three meters," indicates Audette.
400 jobs move
The Fujitsu partnership transfers its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work of their previous building of offices in the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park.
The Japanese partnership Fujitsu transfers its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant of the sector specialized in computers and their maintenance communicated Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year of their previous building of offices in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park, a great complex of offices in the street Lyoner Straße in the district of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman of Fujitsu explained that medium term other 100 employees more of the partnership, who previously were scattered by the region, will lodge there.
The supply is highly attractive, in addition the collective office in Star Park will favor the way to work of the employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only renter in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner affirmed, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The shining connection with the airport is very important at present for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region brought about yesterday joy between that they were to favor and deception between which they were against.
The platoon leader of economy of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU) affirmed that with that a "Global Player" has gained.
This is a "magnificent recognition to the location."
Fujitsu is based in the city, the establishment is a great impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (the green ones) laments himself of the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction informed before to the city on its intention.
"Naturally we have offered to the company our aid," declared Korwisi.
Nevertheless, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons producieron the fall.
Of such way, now there is a great empty place that to cover in the famous position.
"I hope that the proprietor and the landlord of the building are cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" comprised with the leftover buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controverted project of construction of the bath city.
As joint project of the city and a private enterprise of projects between the station and the city council forms a new entrance to the city, that is in charge of the critic as far as the massive construction that previously used the hollows like places of parking and as far as the level of the buildings.
In 2001 they have settled the council of investment and companies of appraisal, the manufacturer of Software for reservations systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then it united Siemens with the manufacturing house of Fujitsu computers.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu partnership, native of Tokyo, is clear like the third greater world-wide supplier of YOU.
It has companies, for example of computers and servants, and also serves precise.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the majors in Germany, of all Fujitsu ways counts on more businesses in Munich.
The branch Fujitsu Technology Solutions settles from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following branchs in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
For that reason 7,000 meters squared in the building of offices of Star Park have been rented.
The old complex of the Twenties, its name alludes to its plane with star form, among others lodges to the central association of electrotechnic and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the servant - Threats against Assange
The anguish seizes more and more of Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet service provider has eliminated the platform of revelations of its servant.
Possibly behind political pressure is after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, apparently is lengthy in England.
The platform of revelations of Wikileaks is always the target of the critics, always more forts in the United States.
The Internet activists lost the access to their previous American servant and at the moment they look for a mother country of Internet in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, call to other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, that is in the list of looked for people of INTERPOL, must remain lengthy in Great Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the servant of Amazon."
"To speak freely in the country of the freedom," communicated the activists of the revelations by means of the service of Twitter mail Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the company of Internet, Amazon, had eliminated documents of Wikileaks of its servant.
The Internet activists had resorted in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Web of Amazon services to be able to do against the high numbers of access to documents.
By means of Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following thing: "Perfect, we will destine our dollars to contract people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with the freedom of expression, "they would have to stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servant by means of Wikileaks, after an employee of senator Joe Lieberman had asked for investigations, informed chain Cnn according to a call to the office into Lieberman.
The presidency of the advice of the Senate for the security of the country had threatened to Amazon boycott, informed the Briton "Guardian."
"It had wished that Amazon took these measures before, before previous publications of information classified by means of Wikileaks," declared the senator.
Lieberman also solicitd that the platform also prohibited in other countries the use of the servant.
"The illegal, monstrous and thoughtless process of Wikileaks puts into play our national security and threatens the life in the world," affirmed in an official notice of the independent senator.
"No company responsible, or American or foreign, must help to Wikileaks with its service to extend robbed material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, that is looked for in Sweden by violation suspicion, is in the list of people looked for of INTERPOL.
According to an article of the London newspaper "The Independent," the Australian of 39 years is prisoner in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has constantly described the investigation in Sweden as a plot as his enemy.
The spokeswoman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, affirmed in London that has existed threats.
"It had even called on a murder of Julian Assange."
For that reason one is afraid for the security of Assange, affirmed Hrafnsson.
Therefore, it follows without revealing the location of the founder of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson reacted evidently before the declarations of North America.
In America, the previous republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, affirmed that the person in charge of the revelations of Wikileaks must be judged by treason and must be executed.
In Canada, he affirmed an adviser of the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in the television, Assange would have "to be assassinated" and Obama could "use drone."
Between the House Blanca and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of American president Barack Obama, described as "absurd ridiculous situation and" that Assange has requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she is responsible to order recently to diplomats who became jumbled in espionage tasks.
"I am not absolutely safe why the opinion of a type with a webpage must concern us," Gibbs declared.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this strong country are much more that their webpage."
The American government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of his data bases of general way.
Russell Travers, attached director of distribution of the National Center against the terrorism, was appointed the exceptional one in charge, announced the White House.
Reason why Travers is responsible to develop "the important structural reforms," that they are necessary in the light of the filtration of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to inspect the ways, as well as to change the total information on the government and to protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to be in charge of the security of the dissidents and activists, they must put in danger the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done all the possible one to put to us in contact with them," affirmed the spokesman of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are preparations to help to protect them if outside necessary."
The university of the ice cream
In the "Gelato University" in Bologna ices-cream dealer at the best times of the year prepare themselves.
The basic course of three days for future ices-cream dealer has the maximum affluence and visitors worldwide.
In fact from where come all the does ice cream?
Of gelatiere and gelataio.
Gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the ice cream elaboration.
Gelataio removes with a spatula the cream from the ice cream from the counter, it extends it on the rolled wafer and it sells it.
In order to know this, it is not necessary to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever to know more on ice creams, would not have to visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped to the university of the ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of its machines fulfills the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course of three days for future ices-cream dealer has the maximum affluence and visitors worldwide.
Also there are more special courses of more days on the chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice-cream shop of the own house.
In these times of crisis, some dream about a new professional race, others risk in the smooth ice cream their vague desires.
This time they are 40 participants of 19 countries of all the continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia happening through Hungary.
To Jacky, professor of this art of California, enchants the slow movement to him of the food and in the future she wants to offer an European product of quality in the Earth of the industrial ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is adviser of companies and wants to create something own in some years within an enervating work.
Two Egyptian young people dream about opening a ice-cream shop in Cairo.
A man of Malt and another one of Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice creams of their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because to their children the Italian ice creams enchant to them.
The masterful ice-cream dealer Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
He is not decisive only its good taste, but also its silky smoothness and its good consistency.
Luciano mainly does not forget its formation nor the cover cream of the house national superior and of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best one, and for that reason each ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems easiest.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: dust milk, cream, milk, sugar and stabilizers in a great beater, that warms up everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment it cools it up to four degrees.
Soon it opens the faucet of the machine and leaves a pasteurised white basic cream, the base for all the milk ice cream types.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can the ice cream cream only be elaborated with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How it is possible to be given vent some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they confuse of the tendencies of the time.
Perhaps the one that speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients," has used stabilizing, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of kidney bean to guar.
By all means that can be made ice cream without stabilizer, it is only necessary to buy it a day, to place it in a stock market and the client will bite a sonorous granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As far as the taste of the ice cream, the teacher Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients those that are bought in the section of fruit or the one of candies of the supermarket.
Furthermore, there are dusts and you graze.
"All the suppliers will try to strain ingredients perfumed in their merchandise."
"Nevertheless they must experiment sometimes."
Or with sherbets of fruit with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream cream of the white basic mass, that with eggs will become a yellow cream and with dust cacao as it bases for all the possible pleasures of the chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the ice cream makers.
Luciano lets to them every time make four types different from ice cream of vanilla, chocolate, moca and countersinks, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also realize the same experiment with fruit ice cream types.
That it knows better does not depend that necessarily it has more aroma of tofe or more puree of fruits.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of hazelnuts knows to fruits droughts, if contains more hazelnuts.
The work group makes the adored ice cream of kiwi, that uses more fruits, less water and rather less stabilizer.
A first well-balanced mixture emphasizes the flavor of the ice cream, affirms Luciano.
The ice cream elaboration is a artimética problem: The peach puree is used by far sugar, is necessary to reduce the proportion of sugar of the basic prescription.
For the lemon ice cream it is necessary an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano removes a utensil with which he determines the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the vinicultor for Oechsle in the grape must).
Luckyly the tables facilitate the account.
To make ice cream does not require more than the physical application, like before.
Not only the utensil for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass helps.
Also there is a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is fought simultaneously and it cools off below cero to temperature.
In spite of everything, all the automatization remains outside as far as the small one grazes.
The Brazilian Gustavo is stained from top to bottom to itself and its companions with puree of fruits, as if outside a minifirst giant without control.
"In all the courses," affirms the teacher Luciano, "it is only a time question that passes something thus."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European authority of security of the Efsa foods has infiltrated in the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
At the moment this subject formulates it the group of Testbiotech experts, who considers an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of the biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," it affirmed Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts of Efsa on plants genetically modified, and another expert of Efsa also is engaged for years in the Ilsi association.
The partnerships like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the norms of verification of Efsa of plants genetically modified, which locates to him in a clear conflict of interests, Then criticism.
The dispositions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, that in fact is controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticism a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a manager of high rank of Efsa was without the support nor the time of transition to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his side.
Recently, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the inspection of the EU and the industry, that realized the General Oficinal of the Environment as well as a far-sighted parliamentarian of the EU.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interests.
One resorts to all the formal data, also to some of the industry, whenever they are of a discharge and technical quality, are become ordained in a report.
One does not demand the experts who work in Efsa which they do not have any contact with the industry.
But they must exhibit these contacts.
Kuiper admits its work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in EE.UU.
One denominates to itself like a neutral forum for the experts and science, the industry and the policy, among others for the evaluation of the risk for the biotechnology without the order of Lobby.
In this subject, independent experts, like Then, criticize that at the moment transgenic plants without investigating the food for the animal are allowed and that the influence of the plants genetically modified on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically makes the modified maize in agriculture," it affirms Then.
The present practice consists of only verifying isolated proteins, but not it whole transgenic plant, which does not offer trustworthy results.
"If the risks do not look for, how they are going away to find? ," he asks, prosecutor, Then.
Los Angeles Hilbeck thinks in the same way.
The scientist investigates from 1994 the field of the genetic engeneering and at the moment she works in the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this scope, the industry tries more and more, in EE.UU and Europe, to influence or to discredit to the scientists critics.
For that reason, there are few scientists who are not influenced by partnerships.
For the companies, the studies critics are not published as a rule.
"The industry controls the investigation of the security," maintains Hilbeck.
The sign of stones
Uli Gsell has obtained some, altogether about 400 kilos.
Monday was before the station of Stuttgart, with the Tuba to the backs.
There were manifestations
It snowed.
History is well-known: In September the excavators arrived and began to demolish a great piece of the North wing.
The Earth de Stuttgart never returned to be the same: Thousands and thousands were pronounced against s21, the suspension of million in the station.
As it were sealed, most of the wing hizó rubbish.
Defeat in 6.000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, is 43 years old.
A pair has made sure pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They do not have to disappear."
One is excited: "Cheap and poor, simple and natural a stone."
As it said once, it has smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
Still it does not know what will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The sign of stones of Stuttgart takes to a forest in Tubingen in a previous ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The man of 44 years deals with old stones.
It has bought everything what is from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, would grind gravel or they would send it to the waste basket," it affirms in his office, a wood small house that once was a guard house.
They insulted to him and they threatened, explains, when, in September, it appeared in newspapers, that it had bought the rest of the North wing to the company of demolitions.
It spoke with the enemies of 21S during several days.
And it explained to them that it could not do absolutely nothing by the demolition.
And when it happened, then he was most reasonable, when the stones continued being used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took mazizo from 80 kilos cut, with a price by piece of 6.50 to 14 Euros.
Some also took it like memory but with the hope from being able to give back it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest a long time ago it was sold.
Owner of gardens, gardener landscaper, ordered of projects.
They arrived from all parts and they took what they could take in the trunk and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse for a long time it has been becoming "the wall" or in the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact this stone is not nothing special," affirms Rongen.
"If not outside by the political component."
It ascends to its four-wheel drive vehicle, makes a tour by its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
It studied right, it interrupted its studies, and later Biology, interests the computers to him and finally it works with stones.
And he is loving of stones.
Metheglin to 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures by all Germany.
It claims to be old stone the treating major of the country.
It restrains.
In the snow there are artistic stones of arenaceous perforated.
"Pertencieron to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," it explains.
White, yellow, warm limestone, is excited.
"My dear stone."
The way crosses the forest.
It indicates a pile: Arenaceous red, a previous piece of the station of Karlsruhe.
And it follows.
"Beautiful travertine."
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion de Stuttgart.
Throughout in the snow, stones and histories, yellow travertine of the headquarters of police of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, tufa of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about as it carved stones before and it moved them with a simple equipment and a cart, it feels very devotee.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
One has not become rich, absolutely immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave that to do to the treating one of stones, in addition stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassworker and a gardener have settled above in the forest.
"We worked hard, but he is satisfactory," affirms the man who is in charge to take advantage of the rest.
Soon it must go to Colony.
There also there are stones that to rescue.
Fight of talents around great potentials
One active affluence in the buffet reigns.
16 students crowd themselves around rolls, tomato soup and candies.
The Technical University of Brunswick and the manufacturer of Vokswagen cars has invited to a factory to the students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a species of contest of ideas, they must speak on the car of the future with the workers of BW and in addition learning everything on Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, like BW, meet in a hand-to-hand combat around the privileged minds more in collaborations with the universities.
Su mission: To contract the sooner the students with more talent of the universities, before they enter the work market and are contracted by others.
And as the universities do not facilitate publications on the abilities of their students, it is tried to watch to the exceptional talents in projects practical and to catch them.
The second day of project in the Technical University of Braunscheig, the partnership gains to the talents.
One young lady of the Personnel Department distributes ball-point pens, gomitas and folders with the logo of BW.
It explains to deluded the young talents the programs of practices and the works for students and it shows its ways to them in the partnership.
Nico Seals of the Technical University of Brunswick takes the project with BW.
It sees advantages for both parts: "The students make contact with the industry and acquire experience."
"As well, BW can know the students, observe more of near the interesting candidates and considering them like possible working futures."
Some collaborations, say Seals, are not little common.
The newness is in which the students are wished so directly.
"The main point previously was in the technical projects," it affirms Seals.
The fight by the fresh graduated ones is becoming harder.
In many branches, the companies no longer can choose to their employees between a great group of applicants.
If not that they must announce and, mainly, to obtain a highly qualified manpower.
All the students of the engineering disciplines are in an excellent situation of negotiation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI by its abbreviations in German), in October 40,000 positions of vacant engineers existed.
And, according to the prognósticos of the VDI, this emptiness of engineers it will grow still more.
In the company of audit and advising, KPMG, Roman Dykta are in charge of the hunting of talents.
It organizes expensive events of hiring, like the race KPMG, a type of modern yincana, in which the participants must find their way by means of the coordinated ones of GPS.
The company wants to send to eight very promising students to EE.UU the following year.
In addition the participants can observe the branchs of KPMG and learn on the company.
It is decided who must go in two rounds of election in the exit.
Crème of crème of many participants only goes to EE.UU.
The universities strive more and more in choosing and polishing to the high potentials of the universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to emphasize of the mass."
"The simple passage by itself we had left short."
For the Dykta scout the notes give results.
"Until today we are a similar action in the last year old with all the participants."
"Some are near their aim, and want to solicit to work with us," it affirms.
Besides the direct approach in the campus, they also are to the hunting, mainly, the companies small and medians, classic with its fairs of the work.
"We tried to obtain students in the specialized fairs."
"Something on Intersolar," affirms Sitha Stübe, in charge of personnel for the solar manufacturer of technology Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problematic one the new generation.
At the moment in the webpage of the company they appear 35 vacant positions.
"He is being very complicated to fill up the vacant positions."
"Hill long time and money," it affirms.
A shorter way is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several schools superiors, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The professors advise that their theses can be made practices with us or be realized.
Faces are not realized advertising campaigns for the solar specialists.
For that reason the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal atmosphere, level hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A great partnership normally cannot offer it," declares Stübe, the one in charge of personnel.
In the search of a use, the money no longer is most important.
The decisive factors are flexible attendance, schedules to children or good possibility of ascent.
According to a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld shows place 55 between the 100 better employers of Germany.
The institute makes an annual list of the best suppliers of use German.
So it asks the employee the satisfied thing that is with the work and the atmosphere in the same and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the one in charge of personnel also waits for points extra in its classification by its aspirings to work.
"I believe that the applicant pays attention especially to the external sorts of a potential employer," she affirms.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises to the companies that want a long term strategy that they gain good reputation like employers.
It advises to its clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mainly, measured internal.
"The best way to become attractive as employer passes through the own employees," assures.
In the slang of the sector Employer internal Branding is called, also promotion of corporative identity within the own group.
"Some used satisfied are the best ambassadors."
When one treats people well and they identify it with the company, then promotion for the employer on the part of known friendly is obtained directly and.
"It is like a game with gang," affirms Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil perforations
From the coast of the American state from Florida to the Gulf of Mexico it has not appeared in these years any new oil perforation.
The government of Washington emitted a forceful prohibition and in this way he annulled its previous plans of unquestionable way.
Also before the Atlantic coast they remain new perforations forbidden at the moment.
This announced the minister of the interior, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What brought about this strict prohibition, that will be effective at least the following five years, it is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that the life to eleven workers cost and caused the greater environmental catastrophe of the EE.UU., president Barack Obama it had admitted new perforations in the part the west of the gulf of Mexico under pressure of the opposition and the industry.
Those in favor thus wanted to diminish the dependancy of EE.UU of new petroleum provisions of the foreigner.
Until today it has not been clarified absolutely of whom it is the responsibility of the irreparable oil slick in the gulf.
In center of the critic is the British power partnership BP, that is faced million demands.
A commission of investigation ordered by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Later, different peteroleros partnerships presented requests for new attempts of perforation.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe using some harder controls and some stricter regulations of security.
At the moment the authority of control responsible, that after to be accused of corruption positions has fallen in disrepute, root reform.
Obama announces of parallel way that will close the lucrative fiscal lagoons for the partnerships of petroleum and the gas.
The industry announces publicly that the total extraction in the gulf will be smaller thanks to a stricter regulation, to date.
"The plans of the government are the greater brake for the growth of the industries of petroleum and the gas," says the result of the present sounding realised by the company advises BDO - before the prohibition extraction Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance complaint of the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what changes exactly with the regulation."
The investments in new projects of extraction extend so far, to the detriment of the growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is brown petroleum, smells like a powerboat: Million liters spilled of crude have destroyed the nature in the Ogonilandia Nigerian.
People live on the robbery, the corruption and the illegal commerce of petroleum.
To Celestine Akpobari it seems to him well.
"You do not get tired," tranquilizes the environmental activist to the journalists: "Today it will pass sufficient petroleum before your eyes."
The Nigerian of 37 years has been able to photograph to boys overcoming in the water until the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences in the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
One does not see that on the surface brown petroleum spots float.
Before it took prawns here to handfuls, explains Esther Badom in the border of the Bodo-Jetty river.
While, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of petroleum by a broken pipe was spilled in formidable moist soil.
The fish of the environs of the small city of Bodo had to swim six hours to arrive at waters full of fish: That, in the heart of the delta of Niger and located in Ogonilandia, it is considered like one of the infestedest regions of the world.
In the way of the route of the river that happens through mangrove swamps, extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the motor of the boat removes a brown broth, that submerges its hand in the water, will remove some full from petroleum.
The roots of the trees of the mangrove swamps rise from the ground like dark woods of liquorice, sadly they isolate the palms that hit and hang their palms.
In vain flocks of birds look for, as if they were in moist soil as always: As soon as the barrier of the outside is shut up, expands in her a species of ghostly calm of a paradise previous with scent to powerboat.
"What here it happens is an ecological fight," affirms, shy, Celestine Akpobari. "We lived in constant danger for the health."
The warlike comparison comes.
The zone of the establishment of ogoni is a bitter battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers burst in more ago than 60 years, organized the first resistance in years 80 with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa here, later executed, had here to place his first factory the Shell partnership in 1993, because he would be too dangerous for the employees of petroleum.
Still nowadays the return of the companies to Ogonilandia is prohibited: While they pumped daily more than two million black gold barrels of all the region of the delta, a size three times greater than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipes, the petroliferous fields in Ogonilandia were calm, the location is too unstable for the partnership.
Each two hundred meters excelled steel platforms like eccentric sculptures of the water: "Little trees of Christmas" called affectionately to the heads of the drills.
They have up to 50 years, the majority present a total corrosion.
Constantly it fails a mall pillow, it thinks Akpobari, then manna a constant petroleum spurt in the water.
According to the valuations of the experts, two billions of liters in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta have been spilled more than: Year after year, the amount of oil has been penetrating, as in the failure of the ship "Exxon Valdez" for 21 years in the sea of Alaska, one of the ecological majors catastrophes of the history of the humanity.
Who is responsible for the lasting environmental region, she will fight in this way.
Whereas the partnership of Shell and the organized petroleum robberies is responsible for more of the 90 percent of the contamination, the ecologists see the mall pillows on the verge of breaking itself and the pipes with flights like the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell normally applies to mainly low standards of security in the world the conventional ones, reproached the scientist Richard Steiner to the partnership in 2008: The indices of defects of the pipes only are "on a multiple greater than in another place."
In a place, that from far seems forgotten, it appears a full factory of petroleum under the free sky, arise figures among the mangrove swamps: They are naked and petroleum places setting.
Between one of the many barrels, that sometimes are united to the perforations, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the land, a fire flames: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, petroleum warms up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First of all, the gasoline penetrates by means of the pipes in the container, later the petroleum pipe drips and finally it leaves diesel engine.
This way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel engine of 300 liters: "Naira contributes 34,000 to Us," around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage fuel in one of the majors petroliferous states of black Africa.
Nigeria only counts on an only refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of the 40 diesel engine of Euro-penny by liter the illegal heaters hardly can offer still less: Thus they reduce the value of his raw material.
It comes from "those of búnkers," that pocketed a ball the network of pipes that crosses Ogonilandia: According to the experts, to this step at least 16 million liters of petroleum to the day in all the delta of Niger are lost.
Only one insignificant part of the material stored provisional premium is refined clearly illegally: The organized criminal networks, to which also political and high military posts belong, keep the best part in rain tanks and they sell it cheap in the world-wide market.
The Akpobari activist considers the debate purely academic on if the environmental catastrophe is due to the handling of the population or to the loose way of production rather.
"If the oil ones did not behave as invading and they had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be sabotage, neither illegal robberies, nor refineries."
Whereas the conditions of ogoni are destroyed mainly by Shell until the point that only appears a deduction of the partnership: "Perhaps he is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese."
Michael puts himself nervous.
"It already goes being hour of which you disappear," the muscular Ölmann says.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes to the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to them arresting them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers coming from the north also want, like all the Nigerians, to remove benefit from the raw material.
"This condemned invention has made pieces completely to our country," affirms Akpobari.
The investigators detect dangerous defects of factory in the motors of the A380
Apparently, the A380 has a great problem of security.
In an investigation of a machine that realized a forced landing, the investigators found a possible defect of factory, that he can produce "a catastrophic failure in the motor."
The Qantas airline wants to demand the manufacturer of the motor.
The passengers of the Airbus de Qantas that realized a landing at the beginning of November in emergency had much more luck than the one than can be imagined: The Australian authorities of aerial security perceived thanks to their investigations a great problem of security in the motors of some A380, and alert of a possible defect of factory.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a connection of sleeves, fissures by fatigue can be caused or cracks, announced the authorities of the ATSB in a published report Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the motor."
This affected to the motors made by Rolls-Royce pertaining to 20 airplanes of the A380 series.
Between that is the Qantas-Airbus that it had to realize a forced landing the 4 of November in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal stockings against the British manufacturer of turbines.
It presented one demands in the federal court of Sidney who made possible more legal measuring against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, declared that its airline will demand an indemnification by the incident of November principles.
In the brand of the motor there are lost pieces and its wing is aggravated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of the gasoline like the cause of the damages.
After the incident, up to 40 motors worldwide they must be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they will carry out more tests of security to the superJumbos equipped with the affected motors.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, affirmed Martin Dolan, spokesman of ATSB.
The security problem has become sufficiently important like informing to all the affected.
After the landing in emergency of equipment of Qantas, the airline maintained to its earth A380 fleet during many weeks.
Its eleven Singapore Airlines maintained approximately to three of A380 temporarily in earth.
Lufthansa replaced the motor of a A380 like precaution measurement.
This airplane with double covered is the greater passenger airplane of the world.
Nevada in all the country brings about the chaos in the traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed in almost all the country.
In many streets the chaos reigns, fail the trains and the airplanes.
At least three people are lost the life in traffic accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: In almost all the country frozen temperatures were reached during the night of Thursday, which has triggered the chaos in the traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and the east, there is a snow layer of 15 centimeters of thickness.
The traffic is very limited in the majority of freeways and many streets.
In the A7 around Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, clearing the new snow time and time again, but it is not prepared.
In addition, forts wind gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Marine and Hydrographic Federal Agency of Germany (BSH) waits for tides cheers with the level of the water 1.2 meters over its habitual level in the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the snow accumulation caused considerable problems in the freeways and the state highways.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert in Sächsischen Schweiz is summoned, in fact the highest alert.
There there are partially 30 centimeters of snow just fallen and cold and strong winds are in charge to crowd around it.
There they remained catched during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities notified important disorders in the streets.
In the A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed the traffic and created cloggings.
In Thuringia the snowed ones affected to the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, great upheavals in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt are expected, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
The snow in the highway, the trees fallen on the tracks or the destroyed catenary and the holes is the main problems.
In Saxony the interurban service of Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia a train HOISTS had to stop its trip to Munich.
The firemen and the service of rescue took care of the 165 passengers in the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
In the greater German airport, the winds with snow brought about numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokeswoman of the power station of flight information, in Munich already some cancellations have announced.
In Frankfurt a.m. Main, according to a spokeswoman of Fraport already there are 40 cancelled flights.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
Nevertheless, there are few passengers beached in the airport, in spite of that are 400 prepared camp beds for them.
In many streets, Wednesday in the evening already were many accidents.
In the evening a truck driver passed away in a collision with a train in a crossing of via in Ostholstein.
The machinist underwent minor wounds.
Near Nuremberg a similar accident because of the snow-covered streets took place: Also a truck was reached here in a crossing of routes because the vehicle remained bared.
The conductor was killed.
In the train four passengers were wounded, the route of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition a woman of 30 years passed away, after giving an upset with her car near Aschaffenburg in a slippery highway.
The meteorologists have the good news: The snow will be more and more smooth and type dust and therefore will crowd around himself in smooth gusts of wind.
But the wind will fall.
The Baltic Sea will only be affected by strong and fast winds.
Without a doubt it will continue doing much cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deusche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate of its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution looks for buyer for its towers of offices in its headquarters of Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million Euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank fixed its headquarters: The twin towers in the district of the banks of Frankfurt were modernized\; while the bankers returned to their place of old work.
But now the financial partnership seemingly wants to remove to benefit the costs from the reonvación, and looks for a buyer for both skyscraper, as it affirms "Financial Times Deutschland" being based on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the reasons for the sale in project.
"We always verified if it agrees to own the properties or to sell them and next to return to rent them," it affirmed.
For that reason the greater credit institution of Germany returns to resign to the headquarters of its company after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in the middle of 2007 by 272 million Euros of the investor of a fund of the house and next it realized the pertinent adjustments to him.
The reforms energetics reached some numbers of approximately 200 million Euros.
A sale would suppose much money for the bank.
The experts of this scope calculate the value of the famous towers of the newspaper like "Greentowers" in around 500 million Euros.
If the buildings renewed in a fund of the bank are sold or to an independent investor it has not been developing at the moment, it affirmed the spokesman.
Thousands of people of mourning by the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people they thought about the buried miners, who occurred by deceased after many explosions in a mine.
Still they have not been possible to find corpses, because the safety measures continue being precarious in the place of the misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion in the mine Pike River near the city of Greymouth took place.
29 miners of ages between 17 and 62 years were buried in the mine.
A sounding in the place of the misfortune was introduced, but it did not discover any signal of survival.
Due to the high toxic gas concentration and successive explosions, no rescue team could lower by reasons for security.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there were no possibilities that the miners had survived.
They have not been possible to reclaim the bodies to date.
At the moment the relatives and friendly remember to the deceaseds with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining brightness of the sun in Greymouth in the New Zealand island of the south.
They keep silence during two minutes.
In tribute of the buried miners, 29 tables with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners were placed.
Also there were personal photographies and objects, underneath articles to dress and tables surf.
The flags waved to average spear before the governmental buildings of the country.
New Zealand hoped that the miners returned to the surface "of the depths of the Earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government said, to the participants of the commemorative act.
"But never they returned to house."
It cannot assume the death of his son until it has not seen its body, affirmed Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Next to the president of the government and to the relatives of the victims many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
In the first explosion the 19 of November also were buried miners of British and South African origin.
The rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coalmine in the island of the south of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the burning temperatures of the interior of the mine will begin to descend, declared Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, to the journalists.
To the devil, soldier!
Does Gore fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicholas Winding Refn returns to explore the borders of the sort with his epic of battles "Walhalla Rising."
About public what Nicholas Winding Refn when rolling "Walhalla Rising" will have thought the Danish director?
A soldier imprisoned Viking with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees of his torturers and assassin to his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young spectators who look for bloody action, indeed because to our hero it likes to use brutal methods to kill and to take to his enemies the guts of his bodies with life when he is of the bad humor.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is called in fact, does not say almost any word during all the film and the other characters let themselves at the most take by one or two phrases or a pair of laborious mortal shouts.
Otherwise tuna and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland are shut up and enjoyed, that the frames offer to the world Viking of approximately thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for film directors grown and interested in the existentialism and movements of camera very calmed.
When a film has several groups of adressees are a pain who cannot be discarded mutually.
Director Winding Refn considers to his savages and the trilogy on the dealing drug hairdo "Pusher" like a species of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to cause that their works are for all the public with a little more humor in the mainstream or rather less brutality of the artistic house.
A cerebral mass and some guts that appear cannot dissuade to the majority of the followers of the artistic cinema.
The majority of fans of the action dies of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with troops of violent cristioneros missionaries by interpretable reasons and it remains clogged an eternity in the calm and the fog before its equipment arrives at America and returns to shut up itself there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found distributing cinematographic in Germany and it is only published in DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of sometimes exciting cinema hides, that deserves something of attention.
This film does not deal with about dialogs nor a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into film.
And for that reason there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn condede just a little while of relaxation and its images glaciers and the dismal sound track of critical moment are made a knot him in their throat, mainly, the incredible hatred, that from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
A small blond young person, who supports faithfully to Unojo, only conserves something like innocence, all the others are owned by the wrath.
Mainly, the hero of a single eye, whose reasons are never explained, at any time becomes a soldier left hell for provisional enemies and allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents the undoing, but for which they are perhaps only lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and be admired, to get upset, to alter themselves and to be surprised.
A experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The nuclear energy organization IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country rejects to think on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the average night from the 5 to the 6 of September of 2007, at least four Israeli airplanes battle F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubical building in Syria.
One is in the border of the Euphrates\; the greater and nearer city, to 30 kilometers is Dair ace-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the Organism the International of Atomic Energy (IAEA), tries on a reactor that apparently the Syrians constructed with the help of North Korea in the bucket, stashed in a valley that leaves the river.
According to information of the international intelligence service of EE.UU of the company of end of April of 2008, design a current reactor under the name of the proximities of el-Kibar very appropriate for the plutonium production, with which the nuclear weapons are constructed.
However, the technical one as soon as it serves for other aims that stop those of the Fifties.
The company it showed a presentation in video with blurred satellite imageries.
They showed with an animation by computer where they were the components of the reactor before the destruction, that was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear power station of Yongbyon.
In addition they taught photographies that showed the building from the proximities or the interior.
It did just a short time that the reactor was in operation, says, but it was still not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later than the bombing, it is hardly more well-known than at that time, the enigmas were made majors with time.
The previous president of the EE.UU., George W. Bush kept awake recently in his memories that before the attack the company were totally safe that the Syrians had constructed a reactor in el-Kibar, but that as soon as he saw indications that in the country a program of nuclear weapons existed "."
In Europe, several intelligence agents still more prefer to be prudent and they only speak of a "supposed reactor," although they consider the presentation of the company "reasonable"
They need solid tests, as well as to the IAEA.
When he asked himself to him certainly was to have a reactor ahead, a high diplomat of responded in summer of lapidary way that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians undid with much rapidity of the rubbish of the presumed "unutilised military building" and smoothed the land conscientiously.
However, in June of 2008 an equipment of the IAEA under the command of the previous inspector head Olli Heinonen found rastos of uranium in el-Kibar, that had been made by people.
In addition the IAEA obtained images by satellite on a Member State, of commercial salesmen at the moments right after the attack, that must have a greater informative value of those than it presented the company
However, these photographies did not arrive at the market because a unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought them of exclusive way.
For that reason the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always it gave to understand that it had never had a nuclear program secret nor constructed no reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli arms, explained Damascus.
The IAEA rejected it like improbable after the analyses of particles.
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss on the matter, in the same way that with respect to the images by satellite.
In addition, to the controllers one second inspection in el-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building is prohibited them.
Also Israel keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in functions at the time of the attack, confirmed the official position recently.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not given results from June of 2008 and "it is transformed progressively into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as a western diplomat of high position corresponds with a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally is pending one serious infraction against the treaty of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, by which it guards the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three equipment more like the key for the progress in the elucidation, that must be "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor, and others as these still exist.
The inspectors have not presented publicly until the moment what equipment is, nor what functions have, nor if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated like intern to Marj ace-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again from the proximities of the located cities.
The independent for Institute Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with the images by satellite, that more likely is one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly one is in or immediately next to a military base, Syria it prohibits with this reason the entrance to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna one says that the Syrians fear a registry that the EE.UU have solicitd to the IAEA to spy on the military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert on the equipment thanks to the warnings of the secret service of the EE.UU.
By means of photographies by satellite, the IAEA has indications that it moves material between the three places and the bucket to the border of the Euphrates.
A western diplomat with a high position in Vienna affirmed that at least one of the equipment can be "related to the fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensible activities," neither of restructuring nor uranium enrichment\; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor drives himself with uranium that is not enriched.
From where the uranium Y must come where the plutonium for the pumps must separate later, for these central questions has, in the best one of the cases, reasonable suppositions.
There are no doubts on if the ruins, the valuable tracks either that can recover, they are in the three places.
As the hundreds of load of the trucks of the ground disappeared, nobody has information exceeds where they remain the rubbish.
The OIAE considers the salt mine improbable al-Tibni, located in the few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, that the Syrians recognized in 1998 by their aptitude like zone for radioactive residues.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in an analysis of the images by satellite for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographies from the orbit show that the Syrians carried out earthworks in the three supposed suspicious places and eliminated great containers after the IAEA asked for the entrance.
It can be chance but as soon as it contributes to dissipate the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector the unfolding is said that the IAEA has used some months to develop an inspection plan, that the Syrians allowed, to keep the possible military secret there, only shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, critical Damascus also this proposal.
The western diplomats in Vienna a year ago tranquilized themselves with which the reactor already was destroyed, for that reason the subject does not have much urgency, for a pair of months, Glyn Davies, a type of ambassador of the EE.UU uses the exceptional calls inspection, one of average the most rigorous ones than the Viennese nuclear authorities must to establish the controls.
Yukiya Skill, the director of the IAEA, that must propose these inspection, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future," but still vacillates.
This way is very dangerous: For it the majority is needed the government advice of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not in favor indeed anxious of a scaling.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected: "And what happens final S.A. does not find anything"
The love in the times of the war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie still began in summer with the direction of its debut without name.
She herself has written the script, a history of love between Bosnia and a Serb.
It is not known much more on the matter, but this is sufficient for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with its Serbian rapist during the war of Yugoslavia.
The associations of Bosnian women have protested quickly, consequently in the last minute they transferred some planned days of running in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been rolled in Hungary and the post-production, but still there are protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the feminine organization of victims of the war wrote to High the Commissariats of the UN, ACNUR, by Jolie and asked for an encounter with the actress, informed to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of High the Commissariats of the UN for the refugees.
She has not been diplomatic, for weeks the women offered an encounter to him in Hungary that it rejected.
The encounter took place in Bosnia, affirms Hasecic.
Histories of love in the fields of violations do not occur, and the position of Jolie on the matter exposes to the victims the sufficient thing on the script.
Her organization in agreement with High the Commissariats of the UN for the refugees has recommended to dismiss to Jolie like ambassador, informs the Guardian.
But what has written Jolie for the scenes exactly?
The Bosnian ministry of culture that read the script, granted after a strip and relaxes a permission of recording in Sarajevo, is not absolutely clear because Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not persecute political intentions with her film, introduces by far effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and to give voice to all the implied parts.
Its content continues being imprecise.
In the network one second synopsis of the film circulates that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and return to be when she, Muslim Bosnia, is deportee to a Serbian field in which he works like guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of violation falls in love with torturer."
It is certainly the film of Jolie really begins before the war.
The pressure exceeds she, affirms Jolie, is "unjust and cradle in erroneous information."
At the moment they can obtain La Paz with the hackers of Hollywood: Whereas the script follows illegally in the network, like many others previously.
Nothing like far from here
This behind schedule finally it returns to be good for the Irish.
No sign of affliction
However, the house equipment dominates on its clients of Sweden, Finland and EE.UU.
Fans shouts of joy while high music resounds, strike the ground with the feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in sudirlandés Cork, because the players send themselves, and find, balls of pingpong to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange spectacle is called "Beerpong," and the prize for the winner tickets from airplane to Las Vegas for the world-wide championship of beerpong in January are 500 Euros plus some.
They back water Tanner is a calm type, this eccentric drink game and discreet the computer science one in fact they do not make good crumbs.
And the boy of 26 years tries to amuse himself with that, to relax of the sudden question, what will provide to him the future.
The diversion in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January will realize a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad premonition," it affirms.
"It is very far from house and not yet I have work there."
At least: Perhaps her bride hopes to him in Auckland, "of threw found the job of her dreams like manager of events, is a good signal," says the young person and smiles.
Because of the bad perspective at home, two of the three brothers of Tanners already have looked for luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin works at present like adviser of YOU in London.
The young people go away: In the island there are many families like the one of the Tanners.
100.000 Irish will leave the near country in the future, foretell the experts in economy and the institute of social investigation ESRI of Dublin.
Up to 2015 200,000 emigrants count themselves.
A great loss for this small country just by 4.5 million inhabitants.
The prognoses are confirmed, comes a comparable migratory wave to which it underwent the island in the Eighties.
After one decade of progression that trajó a great well-being to the Irish, at present extends the melancholy.
The economic crisis mainly confuses to the young people, Irish good formed, for which until now, everything is uphill.
The deprivation of rank and privileges and the social reduction seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
All need that there is money in abundance.
But three of each ten men and smaller women of thirty years they are in unemployment.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director in mass of young emigrants, who complain which: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"It must have a rise against the politicians and the bankers, but who can, one goes away and it loses our country and to a whole generation in this way."
"The last one that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, student of right and president of the union of Irish students see appear a shady future because the government is only dedicated to assemblies and no longer he offers perspective de futuro to young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have strategies to obtain new jobs," affirms the girl of 20 years.
He observes as their companions go of some practical nonreumneradas to the following.
Its greater preoccupation, explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People as Stephen McLarnon tries to see this subject of positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that offers a service about to work abroad.
"For that they begin to work, to do it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your race," affirms the manager.
In its webpage they appear photos of a boy practicing surf in Australia and of another one practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, if not that entail freedom and diversion.
For half year, Seán O'Donovan knows how it is to construct something elsewhere.
Since no longer there was nothing to do for the engineer of 29 years, at the moment it works with 15 Irish companions in the construction in Germany.
Now they take down a tent of fashions in Gelsenkirchen.
In January one goes away to Hannover or Berlin, to the following project.
O'Donovan sees its mother country only not very often because it works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," affirms long ago, since of the first time that stepped on the threshold of its house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which never I am so well."
Something ashamed is laughed and it goes away by frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential zone with well-taken care of gardens before the houses, in the entrance great and expensive cars are parked.
O'Donovan bought the house along with its sister four years ago by 380,000 Euros, 100 percents funded by a credit.
"They were crazy times, was easy money without many questions," it says.
It is scared to fail with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks awhile, serves more hot tea and says: "I do not have children whom he must feed and am young\; if everything leaves bad, I can begin from zero."
To the civil engineer it does not like the complaints that often listen at the moment.
"Nobody must pass hunger, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here in the island," it affirms.
"To work one season abroad it is not the worse thing perhaps than it can happen, in this way we felt for the first time like Irish."
One laughs and it tells on his father, that in last the great economic crisis one went to England.
"After seven years it returned and the life continued in Ireland, very simple."
To she Backs water Tanner like these ideas.
To let slope the future and simply see as it is the life elsewhere.
A pair of years in London already worked and why it wasn't going to them to go well to him and his bride in New Zealand?
But in these days there is a thing that troubles to him of excessively: the celebration of its 27 birthdays Friday in Dublin.
It fears that it can degenerate in a goodbye celebration.
"Only, not too many emotions," says and gives a great drink to its beer.
"Dismissed, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we called it a celebration to march, very relaxed, with a pair of friendly, a pair of drinks, a pair of games."
The democratic routine
It continues increasing the support the democracy in Latin America, as well as the endorsement to private enterprises.
The delinquency generates major preoccupation that unemployment.
In addition, to a large extent of the region, it is seen Brazil like a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last survey of the Latinobarómetro realised in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been celebrated regularly from 1995, it allows to realize a pursuit of the changes of attitude in the region.
In the results of the survey of this year, realised in September and principles of October, they emphasize two related questions.
First it is ruling relatively animated humor in Latin America.
Second it is the increasing stability of the attitudes towards the democracy and its main institutions.
The support to the democracy has increased considerably in diverse countries of the coast of the Pacific of South America (it consults table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economic growth has reached an average of annual 6% from 2002, the support to the democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after undergoing a great reduction of the production the past year.
However, only half of the survey ones of Mexico and Brazil, both countries more colonising with the zone, democratic are convinced, which lowers the regional average (it consults graph 2).
Around 44% of the survey ones in the region they were declared satisfied with the way in which the democracy in its country works actually, the same number that the last year, but considerably superior to registered 25% in 2001 (graphical 3).
Around 34% it affirmed that they trusted the Congress of his country and 45% in his Government, the same amount that the year last in both cases, but considerably superior in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
One decade ago, the economic turbulences in Latin America affected seriously to the support to the democracy.
The fact that one has stayed during world-wide the financial crisis probably is due that numerous Latin American countries were affected by a brief recession and only enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a social network of security more hard has contributed to protect to poorest.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America informed this week into which the proportion of Latin American that marginally lives in conditions of poverty only increase in 2009 and which this year has been reduced again, until 32%.)
Nevertheless, the mood varies considerably from a country to another one (it consults graph 4).
The good economic yields of Brazil and the popularity of their outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and have increased the violent crimes.
For the second time since the surveys began, more survey in Latin America they mention the delinquency, instead of unemployment, like the most serious problem to the one than its country faces (it consults graph 5).
Around 31% it affirms that, she is they or a close relative, has been victim of the delinquency in the last year, a number that has been reduced from 38% of the past year and that is the smaller percentage registered from 1995.
The economic yields more positives are reflected in a greater support to private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of the survey ones in the region they affirm that private enterprises are indispensable for the development, whereas in 2007 he was only 56% (it consults graph 6).
Around 58% it agrees in which the market economy is the only system that will allow that its country is developed, against 47% the past year.
He is interesting that 62% of the survey ones in Venezuela thinks the same (and 80% endorse to private enterprises), although his leftist president, Hugo Chávez, are expropriating numerous private enterprises.
Brazil is the country that exerts a greater leadership in the region, as it indicates 19% of the survey ones (against 18% the past year), followed by the United States (9%, same number that the past year) and Venezuela (9% against 11% for a year).
Nevertheless, the United States is the country considered more influential by survey in Mexico and the great part of Central America, whereas Venezuela shows such title in Ecuador, the Republic Dominicana and Nicaragua.
Elections to the sweepings
Nobody hoped that the general elections celebrated the 28 of November in Haiti would be perfect.
Nevertheless, they passed of a way much worse than the foreigners were afraid who try to help to the country to overcome after their problems.
Votes in the ballot boxes were introduced, some people voted several times, problems thrown in the culverts, electoral schools destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, inclusively displaced groups by the January earthquake, wandered by the zone trying to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, occurred by won.
A dozen of candidates to the presidential ones, including several of most popular, denounced fraud and requested the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of violent them, extended by all the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the civil servant of the United Nations of greater rank in Haiti, declared that relatively good elections in many senses were "some."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Community of the Caribbean affirmed, with caution, that "we did not think that these irregularities, by serious that are, invalidate the process necessarily."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, that according to its opponents is it jeopardize with René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, would have to announce the preliminary results the 7 of December.
It is anticipated that the tiebrake will be realized in January.
Still all the hopes in relation to the elections are not had lost.
Both main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, one old first lady, has retired their initial request in which they asked for the annulment of the voting.
But still problems can arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who as soon as he has support, if has some, has happened to the second round.
Considering that the epidemic of the rage devastates the country and more of a million of the survivors of the earthquake continues living in stores, is expected a great abstention.
Arrived the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they did not manage to do it due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, they had still not been distributed shortly before the elections.
There is much in game.
The aid donors consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, according to it has been clear, also think it the own Haitians.
Advancing of finishing nails towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since it lost her husband, Cristina Fernandez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great affection between the public who has increased his index of popularity in 20 points, until more of 50%, the greater level than he has registered from his election in 2007.
In spite of everything, that can turn it into a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of next year will depend on if clearly affected Mrs. Fernandez it leaves of side the intransigence of its late husband, its predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, that continued becoming position of the economic policy after her wife happened to him like president, even had the custom to elaborate budgets that undervalued the tax revenues, the economic growth and the inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income to its discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs. Fernandez lost his majority in the Congress the past year.
Nevertheless, the opposition is divided, a situation that has made worse after the death of Kirchner because of a cardiac attack the 27 of October.
Some discrepant members of the Peronist movement in being able have faced Mrs. Fernandez.
Nevertheless, after some chaotic sessions in which a deputy gave to a punch to another one in the face and other deputies him blamed the bribe government, the Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to discuss," said the president.
The 2010 budget, consequently, will be applied to the next year, which will offer to the president a margin of still greater action at the time of spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: probably this year grows until a 9%.
The rate of official inflation is at the moment in 11.1%, but numerous deprived calculations, besides the wage exigencies of the unions, locate it near 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, that assumed the power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of madness the economic collapse, caused that the growth and the reduction of the poverty were their priorities, instead of the control of the inflation.
One refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed to the private sector and it caused that the INDEC, the institute of statistic, adapted the official statistics of inflation.
Moderate the Fernandez president now these will policies?
It has summoned meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
In addition, their civil servants affirm that they want to limit wage increases the year next to 18%.
The economy has been impelled by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
Nevertheless, the inflation has limited the impulse the growth secured with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Mrs. Fernandez is therefore signaling to want to recover the financial bonds of Argentina with the rest of the world.
At beginnings of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders that had refused to previous an unavoidable reconstruction of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs. Fernandez is on the verge of signing an agreement with the grouped deserving governments in the Club of Paris, to which must around 6,700 million dollars.
The Kirchner always insisted on which this would not imply the supervision of the IMF, as usually he is habitual.
Nevertheless, the past month Loved Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Bottom will offer "technical attendance" to make a new national Consumer Price Index, which seems the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear if the Fernandez President wants to follow in the policy when its mandate finishes, considering that no longer it has to its husband to its side.
If it does, the support of the middle-class will need to gain, great part of which it has gotten tired of the kirchnerism.
When the Argentineans return of their summer vacations in March, the wave of affection by her will have decayed.
If it wants to gain other elections, it will have to decide if it repudiates or no, with tranquility, many of the policies of its husband.
Half hurra by China
The voters of Taiwan are approaching a species of nearer union with the continent slowly.
What thinks Taiwan on their great brother to the other side of the Straits?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible ones, they went the 27 of November to choose to the mayors and councilmen of five urban districts in which it seems an ample evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Own Mr. Ma has become a defender from the feelings by the continent, forging innovating enterprise bonds, including a pact of partial free trade, greater the changes in the relations with China from 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but nearly.
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up gaining three of the five elections to mayorship, did not manage to obtain the majority of the votes.
In its place, the democratic progressive Party (PPD), that has inclined by a total independence of Taiwan, obtained practically 50% of all the votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the presidential ones, Mr. Ma would be in problems.
From its election for two years, the proportion of votes of its party has been being handicapped in around a 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the city councils.
In the elections the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections could be seen, including noisy trucks of campaign and great agglomerations with little flags and light girls of clothes dancing.
It did not lack the mysterious attempt of murder either strictly speaking.
They are Roll, the son of Roll Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning by the one of the candidates of the KMT night before the elections.
A man of the multitude shot to the young person to the face directly, hurting to him and killing a passer-by.
The peculiar thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man tried to do damage to Roll to him or to take revenge himself of the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing., the leader of the PPD says, the shooting affected to the elections, seeding suspicions on the PPD and causing that the voters inclined by the KMT.
Perhaps only the great winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that was not the subject the continent in himself.
In their place, the candidates spoke of plans of public lodging and creation of use.
Taiwan normally enjoys its independence de facto and detests the military threat of China.
Therefore, the KMT usually avoids to give publicity to its bonds with the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided to encourage the feeling against China.
It responds the new one brings back to consciousness of which the Chinese commerce is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
On the other hand, Mr. Ma affirmed that he had confirmed myself that its policy with respect to China was acceptable for the majority of the Taiwanese.
It is anticipated that the Government of Beijing continues bribing to them with the commerce, in accordance with his strategy to obtain that Taiwan returns to the fold.
China did not lose the time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of the investments and the medical cooperation.
Without a doubt, it would like to also secure political integration, but first it is first.
The best thing will be to hope to than they pass the presidential elections of 2012 for it.
In any case, the PPD has been re-invented.
Two years ago one was in a bad situation: his old leader, Chen Shui-bian, were jailed accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, incited explicit independence openly.
Nevertheless, under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has arisen from moderate and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai has been welcomed pleasingly like candidate of the PPD for the presidency, like Su Tseng-chang, that complied with mandate under Chen.
Now its party is doing all the possible one to demonstrate that also it can have relations with Beijing.
Mrs. Tsai announced the plans of creation of a group of experts who acts like meeting point between the PPD and China, whenever the negotiations without previous conditions can be carried out.
Mrs. Tsai says to the Taiwanese public that its party represents a "trustworthy alternative" the precipitate focuses of Mr. Ma with respect to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious by the change.
In a declaration issued from his cell, it affirmed that the candidates of the PPD had left better unemployed if they had insisted on which Taiwan is an independent country.
It even ordered to Mr. Su, a pragmatic one, who did not present to the presidential ones.
Without Mr. Chen even intercedes, the PPD will have difficulties to choose between its possible candidates.
The KMT also must make an examination of brings back to consciousness.
The valuations of Mr. Ma have been poor, in spite of the impressive economic growth\; the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be due mainly to unemployment and the rich and poor increasing differences between.
A spokesman of the KMT affirms that she will reconstruct his cabinet, as well as the local equipment.
The great samples of the PPD suggest the support from Taiwan to an approach is limited.
At the same time, the majority of the Taiwanese considers that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "already has crossed the point of no return."
Nominations to the Grammy: the jazz singer Spalding Hope is the election surprise in the category of Artist revelation.
She acts at the request of a president and possibly people will pay attention to you.
Hope Spalding, the bear and singer of jazz of 26 years selected personally by President Obama to act in its ceremony of the Nobel prize of La Paz in 2009, supposed one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination of high level in the category of Better Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been one acclaimed figure of the jazz from its album of 2008, "Hope," the nomination gives what to think, but respects the norms of the Grammys according to which it must be an artist who has not removed to the market more than three albums before recording the one that "she determines the public identity of this artist."
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," without a doubt supposed a breakthrough and, considering its slight and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with influences of MGP, Latin funk and rates, can be at least established a distinction between Spalding and the way towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the voters of the Grammys, who lately are concentrate in the scope of the jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy made honor with reason to "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent disc that was the one of the favorites year past.
Between the competitors of Iyer is the veteran James Moody saxophonist with "Moody 4B" and the teclista John Beasley by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favorite in New Orleans and habitual guest in "Treme," of HBO, was honest in the category of contemporary jazz, that by the rest inclines considerably towards the fusion like in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society obtained a deserved recognition in the category of great groups, competing against the great jazz of camera of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always dangerous Dave Holland, whose live album with its octet, "Pathways," it was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bear in his band.

The propose mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the ordering commission
The project of mosque for Temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the commission of local ordering after more than five hours of testimonies public, often heated.
The critics attacked the project saying that he foments the terrorism and the cloggings.
Nevertheless, the members of the commission decided Wednesday at night that the new religious center respected the local legislation and would be impressive from the esthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, Christian as as much Jewish or bahaíes, of all the religions," she said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the valley of Temecula, Thursday in the morning.
"The truth is that, like American citizen, it is proud to me."
"It demonstrates that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimum," it adds.
"Only that speaks very high."
"In this valley there is wonderful people."
The meeting began six of afternoon and lasted practically until average night\; most of the time it was dedicated to people who interceded to favor or against the center, practically the same amount in each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued in the website of the newspaper.
"The United States no longer exists," is read in one of the commentaries.
"One is another Planet of the apes with Mrs. died Libertad in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans of construction of Islamic centers have brought about protests also in other parts of the country, including near zone zero, the zone of New York where the attacks of the 11 of September of 2011 took place.

It would occupy a surface of 4.32 acres in Nicholas Road, to around two miles to the east of the Chaparral institute.
The opponents still can resort the project before the municipal Council.
A resistant microbe to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life in the Earth... or other places
The discovery of one surprises bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility of finding new forms of Earth life and, possibly, in other planets.
Although the investigators discovered the peculiar Earth bacterium here, say that he demonstrates that it is possible that there are forms of life without the main elements that considered essential.
"This organism has one double capacity."
"It can grow is with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That turns it into something very peculiar, although little it needs for being a type of form of "really foreign" life," commented Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University, coauthor of the report that appears in line in the edition of Thursday of the Science publication.
For a long time, it is considered that there are six great essential elements for the life: the carbon, the hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, the phosphorus and sulfur.
Nevertheless, the investigators are shortage that the bacterium, found in Monkey Lake, California, can continue growing after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes You raise to you what is possible more," it affirmed Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, coauthor of the report.
According to it indicated Anbar, the finding is important for the search of life in planets different from the Earth, since the investigators need to be able to recognize the life, to know the aspect that it has.
The study concentrates in a microbe Earth shortage.
However, the call of a press conference to debate it, in that details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great speculation in Internet on the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not do it.
What discovery "yes shows is that in another surroundings planetary, organisms could to have that use another elements to impel his biochemistry and that "the standard" set of elements that we considered indispensable for the life is not perhaps so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, university professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, University Open, in Milton the Keyneses, the United Kingdom.
Cockell did not comprise of the investigation equipment.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates to the substitution of an element by another one in the biochemistry and basic the biochemical structure," it added Cockell.
The discovery was not realized by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the institute of astrobiology of the NASA, that directed the study, concentrated in the Lake Monkey because it presents high arsenic levels.
The arsenic and the phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, reason why it speculated that a microbe exhibited to both could replace one by another one.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to the one of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it can turn out to him complicated to the organisms to differentiate them."
"Nevertheless, the arsenic is sufficiently different like so that it does not work as well as phosphorus, reason why enters and, to say it of some way, compresses the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The investigators gathered the known bacteria as GFAJ-1 and every time exposed them to concentrations arsenic majors, to which they managed to adapt and they used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact to demonstrate that it can live with arsenic in his place raises the possibility that a life form can exist of natural form that uses arsenic, or in other zones of the Earth or another planet or moon where the arsenic is the more common.
Jamie S. Foster, junior instructor of microbiology in the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that the arsenic by phosphorus can be replaced is not new, but never had been an example that demonstrated that it works.
The arsenic one was more common in the first eras of the Earth, indicated, reason why the investigators speculated that the first forms of life can it have used.
"Yes that it suggests could exist other means to generate life, not only the way in which the life formed in the Earth formerly," indicated Foster, that she did not comprise of the equipment of investigation of Wolfe-Simon.
The investigation counted on the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Have been the robbed dogs that they lacked in Compton
Dogs have been both that lacked of the four robbed in front of the Bellflower motel, according to affirmed to the officials of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles Thursday.
The four dogs of competition, two Akitas and two Corgi Wales Pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when somebody robbed Chevrolet the Express light truck of 2006 in which they were spending the night, against the Bellflower Motel 6, according to indicated the authorities.
Two of the canine ones recovered Wednesday in the evening and both remaining Wednesday was, behind schedule at night, according to informed Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," it affirmed Whitmore.
"They are in good state."
"They have returned with its legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where were the dogs, in what district, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is taking to end."
"We do not mean nothing," affirmed Whitmore.
"We are following some tracks."
It was not possible to be found the owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, so that they did some commentary Thursday.
Wednesday met in the evening with their two Akitas in an animal refuge of the county in Downey.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van both and dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (It draws up, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog of 10 months) had not suffered damages.
Pero Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek tried to exhibit in the competitions of the zone this week in the name of the Japanese proprietors of the dogs, followed at night disappearing until Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, that live in Redding, were in the city for the national championship AKC/Eukanuba in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention to exhibit to Draws up.
The other dogs were going them to exhibit in other competitions anticipated for the previous days to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to indicated Peek to The Times Wednesday.
The south of California is one of the shutdowns in the tour of practically two months that it realizes the pair participating in canine competitions.
Monday at night, Peek and Rickard did check-in the motel.
Normally they remain in motels and they park the right van in front of the window of its room.
They took to other three dogs (a young of boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, that slept with them in the room of the motel.
But they left to the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very heavy coat and would be fresher.
They left the open windows slightly so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard in the morning denounced the robbery of the van Tuesday to six.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to whatever it could lead until the Corgis, equipped to them of microchips identifying them.
Thursday was not clear if a reward or no. would occur.
The lion is ready roar again, while the reconstruction of MGM secures the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has secured green light finally to begin again.
Thursday, a federal judge of bankruptcies of New York officially approved the plan "prearmed" by the creditors to erase approximately 5 billions of dollars of debt, levelling off the way so that the repair company of 86 years focuses its efforts in the production and opening of films and programs of television.
The failure of Thursday confirms that the plan fulfills the exigencies of the code of American bankruptcy, reason why do not exist other legal obstacles so that MGM is relaunched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that will become the main executives than it will be a reduced study.
The personnel will be reduced of 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes an instrument of planned credit of 500 million dollars, to fund the operations and productions of new MGM.
The investment bank is at the moment syndicating the credit, that by its account is contributing with 75 million dollars, and it hopes that it is funded in the middle of December.
The process of reconstruction of the study began in May of 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. it was contracted to give advising on the management necessary to order his finances, while it fought for being able to realize payments of interests by 300 million dollars to the year.
In the month of August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex- President of Enron and expert in recovery of companies in bankruptcy, known by his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial tribulations of MGM and to satisfy to more than 140 creditors of the study, required time of the awaited one much more.
After several months of discussions, by the end of 2009 the parts decided to put the company on sale.
Nevertheless, the auction attracted few bidders and no ready to pay more than 2 billions of dollars that the creditors looked for.
Before the spring of this year, it returned to the design table while the MGM equipment began to work in a reconstruction plan that, after months of debate and internal discords, finally was endorsed by the creditors by the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the bankruptcy in the next weeks, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive multimillionaire advantages by their work.
Moelis and Co., that already has received 1.2 million dollars, will obtain a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
The companies of Cooper, that are been collecting 375,000 dollars per month by their services of administration of the company, will receive some "honorary of success" of 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum glide to resume the production in MGM, that wore for the first time only one film this year, and reunited an annual slate of seven or eight films that will leave in 2012.
Also they glide to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to arrange a separated loan among 265 and 275 million dollars to fund its part of those two films, that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who approximately owns 18% of the MGM debt, had been trying to fix a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the greatest shareholder.
Nevertheless, the recent conversations between the two companies were not in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for gifts
Whereas iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed by, perhaps, the system of video-games Microsoft Kinect, both can mean a significant notch in their budget for gifts.
It considers that by the price of iPad five bicycles BMX of 99 dollars can be bought each, and a Kinect game costs just like 10 adorned classic cords of jump with accounts, or approximately 48 tins of Play.
But there are ways to maintain its budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three salesmen of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" U.S. and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy less than by 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the Law of Moore has been working\; the technological toy of this year probably will have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared with the one of the past year.
In addition, while generally there are less new toys with associated websites, two to the most known this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club, have more supplies.
And the toys driven by button batteries are increasing, as well as the toys with reloadable batteries.
Here there are some recommendations.
(All the prices are of Toys "R" U.S., unless it is indicated of another way).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are plush toys as large as a guinea pig than they sing a note when their bellies are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaution: Once it begins to tighten, it cannot stop.
For song combined with dance, Mickey Star Dances (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from the technology of Elmo Live of the last year, the animatrónico doll of 14 inches plays games of change of turn like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovating feet articulated with wheels with caging device.
The children who proved the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of a gain control.
If you are a boy of years 80, she can remember to Alphie, one of the first computerized educative toys.
It has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a full letter knapsack of designed questions to turn a stroll into car in a session with a notebook of exercises of ocurrente autocorrection.
If you are distrustful to give to his boy his intelligent telephone, here she will econtrará three independent alternatives.
MobiGo de VTech (60 dollars, of 3 to 8 years) is cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard\; although the games do not teach with as much effectiveness as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, of 3 to 12 years), is the first completion important of the Leapster line, with a newer screen and shining.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
iXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, of 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the iTunes type to present electronic games and books, and has a groove for cards SD that allows to visualize family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just greater than a box of matches, each with its own screen LED.
The objective is to arm to words placing the blocks in row before the time finishes\; he is formidable for a competition improvised of armed of words.
They are more and more the toys that have some class of connection in line.
Based only on its presence in toy stores, both greater they are Webkinz and Penguin Club.
In order to in line buy to its son a mascot to him in the Penguin Club, for example, Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N can be able to a Disney Match Appears Pack, (5 dollars, of 6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with an hidden code.
When you exchange the code in line, his son obtains sufficient credits in the store of the Penguin Club for two articles.
These could include skates on wheels or a toy Puffle mascot.
Slightly greater than the bristle of its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of microrobots driven by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
He is funny to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find the exit.
Also he is lasting.
Ours he was able to let the table of the kitchen and even pass awhile within the mouth of our dog.
A more moderate side of the maintenance of order in China is promoted
Like an urban instructional sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked to the passage in a place of the city, inspecting with severity to the nervous people to its position, emitting orders in low voice with military administration.
It wanted that the feminine members of chengguan, the burly police of the urban order of China, feared and despised by his capricious energetic measures and their inclination to the violence, they would communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firm"
"Attention"
Show to them, whispered, "how they are the beautiful girls"
Four girls who as soon as they passed the adolescence with white gloves and identical jackets green olive and fit pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four placed elegant hats perfectly upon the hair tied with blue and white buns stripped.
"Personally, fodder that has a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, very disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More a government it has dealed with to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city ordered that all the new recruits have a degree title.
The Province of Guangdong changed the grayish green color of the uniforms blue to the supposedly attractiveness.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of the force by intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials surrounded to díscolo cart by snacks, and they constantly observed it with the gathered frown during half an hour, until the traveling salesman picked up his things and he left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a change of radical image.
From 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, specifically chosen by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give to the coarse police a smoother, feminine side.
Lamentably, until Scarlett Johansson it would have to fight to increase the very small respect of China towards these swarms of the city.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officials are authorized to only make comply with decrees of the city, imposing administrative fines and other pains.
But the Chinese means of the news portray a different reality routinely.
In January of 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed to blows a passer-by after to have used their cellular one to film them while they dissolved a protest against a garbage dump of remainders.
The year last, a formation manual for inspectors of Beijing was stolen and published in Internet, in which it was described like whipping with effectiveness to delinquents without making bleed them.
This year, a traveling salesman of watermelons of Shanghai suffered cerebral damage after a fight with five officials.
A game of full video of violence, available to unload in line, presents to inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street salesmen.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, the year last after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
The skeptics say that the present approach is very far from this.
After the district asked for through a warning eight new feminine recruits in October, an editorial in The Peking Evening News was wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little both things.
The warning of the district requested feminine candidates of 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and the five harmonious face characteristics."
They must have a height over the average, superior to 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement at the age of 26 years is obligatory.
The civil servants said that the work was physically too arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"Its image is the important thing," said an anonymous civil servant to him from district to Rednet.com, a nearly governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they fulfill the requirements, like height, weight, face characteristics, etc."
Later it comes the inner temperament "and qualities."
They chengguan them feminine are like flower pots, it said, and it added, "besides being flower pots, will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, assistant director of the office of administration of the city of the district, is not in favor anxious of endorsing that description.
But it observed that the height exigencies were standard in many Chinese warnings of work for both sexes.
Soon the exigency comes from harmonious face characteristics.
If this means to be good looking, it is a matter of debate between the Chinese.
Surely, the disfigured handicapped person or does not have to appear.
"We cannot allow that a person takes or a hunchbacked one comes to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Its image would not be well."
Liu Yi, who patrol Plaza Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its red cheeks and a mouth subtly curves.
She does not think that the accent in their aspect is sexist, said.
"You think that I seem sexy with this uniform" he asked with a sardonic glance.
His fellow worker dimpled, Xu Yang, of 21 years, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They are not against either to their in time certain work, said, because they shelter race ambitions majors that simply to drive away to salesmen in the alleys where she assumes that they circumscribe his business.
Every morning, the swarm faces a dozen of traveling salesmen more or less who on foot send themselves or in bicycle, trying to sell so many rolls or bowls of tofú as it is possible before being thrown.
"Mr. Wang, must leave."
"We have often said to him" the Xu young lady said while a salesman escaped on foot, leaving temporarily her car thrown by bicycle with vermicelli trimmings.
The officials describe their duties like monotonousser than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, of 20 years, who studies marketing in its free hours.
"Very routine."
A reason is that homologous the feminine officials lack the power of their masculine ones to confiscate the merchandise of the salesmen.
They only can threaten denouncing to the violators to his supervisors men.
This trends to protect them of the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, that are common everywhere of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rebelled after which the false rumor that was scattered some officials chengguan had assassinated a salesman.
More than a dozen of police or officials they chengguan were wounded in the episode nocturne\; 14 vehicles of the government were overturned or set fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm as soon as it is guaranteed.
Only to two streets of calm Plaza Baoguang, where the feminine officials patrolled that morning, more than 50 people they met in a corner.
The officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the sidewalk instead of in a factory, as demands the regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted crudely.
The situation stagnated during 15 minutes before the officials, with bad face, they broke through to the elbowing until his vehicles and would quickly go with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, of 40 years, a coordinator assigned to the masculine swarm, remained behind, with its white standard given return to hide its name.
Like the feminine officials, the coordinators, men of 40 years or more, play a support role purely.
Unlike them, it is not taught to maintain an elegant image to them.
"Sometimes we fought verbally."
"Sometimes we fought physically," said Mr. Li with total naturalness.
"Most of the time the one is the public that begins the fight."
The public prosecutors will not raise positions against Ensign Senator
The lawyers of the senator announced Wednesday that the public prosecutors of the Department of Justice have exculpated Senator John Ensign of the criminal imputations that arose from their affair with an ex- assistant of campaign and his efforts to assure work by means of lobby for the husband the woman.
The decision finishes with the legal threat more serious than it faces Ensign, the Republican of Nevada that was considered like possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on its affair had national holders the past year and would damage its race.
The office of Ensign said that it felt surely "contented" by the decision, that arrived after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator still could face a disciplinary measurement of the committee of ethics of the Senate.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice us "had informed who Ensign Senator no longer is an objective of his investigation and that does not have any plan to raise positions against him by this subject."
The Department of Justice did not want to make commentaries on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many lawyers of ethics outside the Department of Justice, who said that it seemed to have tests significant to indicate that Ensign could have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobby.
The interviews, the e-mail and other documents that were disclosed in the first place in October of 2009 in New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of its assistants, to obtain lucrative work by means of lobby, to obtain the silence of Hampton and its wife, Cynthia, on the affair of the senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked like treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign made contact with several sponsoring politicians to find a job him to Mr. Hampton and pleaded in the name of them after they had contracted Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Since Hampton had been recently an assistant of Ensign, it was excluded according to the law to lobby for its ex- employer or the Senate during a year.
The experts in ethics said that the unusual adjustment between Ensign and Hampton, who were friendly intimate before the affair, appeared in discord with the door call "revolving lobbying go," that looks for to restrict that ex- state employees use their connections to make personal businesses.
Of the evidence that has become public, "it seemed to be a case prima facie of a conspiracy to violate substantially the door statute revolving," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington that specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the civil servants of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other lawyers of ethics said that the department seemed cautious at the time of accepting political processings after several important reverses for its section of public integrity, including the decision of the last year to leave the processing against ex- Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of positions by bad conduct of procedure.
The federal public prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," he said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for the Responsibility and the Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that the civil servants of the government of high rank now can suppose that the laws are not applied them," it added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that more on the following day received a telephone call of a public prosecutor of the Department of Justice Monday and another call, saying to him that the department did not want to raise positions against its client.
The equipment of defense of Ensign had been cooperating with the public prosecutors in the attempt to persuade them that the senator, as its office reiterated in a declaration Wednesday, "acted in agreement with the law."
Coggins refused to in detail explain the legal arguments that it gave to the public prosecutors.
"I do not feel in detail comfortable entering on my discussions with the Department of Justice, I only can say that we thought that they made the right decision," it said.
The last month, the Federal Commission of Elections decided to change an investigation in a separated complaint by the ethics group, that alleges that a payment of 96,000 dollars of the parents of Ensign to the Hampton broke the electoral federal law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have sufficient tests to demonstrate that the money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important company of Nevada that had supported during long time the senator, which found a job by means of lobby thanks to the aid that Ensign gave Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December of 2008 demonstrated that after the company accepted to Hampton like lobbista, the head of cabinet of Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and she said to him that was "crushing" the Department of the Interior on a question in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called to the transport secretary to establish a meeting in the name of the air line after it had contracted Hampton to lobby.
When by first they appeared the news of the affair the last year, Ensign asked pardon to him its voters and resigned to its position like fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile during many months, two Ensign weeks ago it said to him to the journalists who glided to postulate themselves to a third mandate in the Senate.
When spokesman of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign no longer was object of a criminal investigation, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee quickly followed the example of the Department of Justice and would conclude its investigation.
"Ensign Senator has desires to continue with his difficult work in the name of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of Cheshire will aim at Twitter
There was average twelfth of them "chateando" in the rows of the room of the court.
Minute by minute, they sent information of the frightful testimony via Twitter.
In the end, it says the defense, it had more than 140,000 messages of Twitter on the process that the violation approached and the children tied to his beds in a house that was set fire.
Thursday, the process widely followed of Steven J. Hayes, who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the capital punishment voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have presented writings in the court that delineate the arguments of the appeals that probably will occupy to the courts during years.
One of most provocative affirms that the intense information on the process, including the ample use of Twitter on the part of the means journalists of massive information, created "a circus atmosphere," and such saturation generalized and immediate with exaltadores details caused that the public passions exerted an unsuitable influence on the jury.
The reclamation could force the appeal judges to fight with the question of if the new technology requires new rules in the room of the court.
"According to what I experimented during this process, fodder that is a true danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the room of the court is affecting the rights of the individual to have a right process," said to Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel of the defense of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of first instance Blue Jon C., of the Court State Superior, very laconically rejected the demands in a failure the last week, saying that the means of the news "were carefully controlled" and that there was no test that the jury has been taken by the passion.
But probably it will not be the last word on the subject.
During decades, the appeal courts have recognized that the cover of cases you celebrate can generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In an historical failure of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States revoked the sentence of an osteopath of Cleveland, doctor Sam Sheppard, by the murder of its wife, saying in its decision, in the Sheppard case versus. Maxwell, who was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to mass media.
One thinks that the crime had been inspired by the program of television and the film "the fugitive one."
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals that later examined the sentence of Mr. Hayes half a century, could feel intrigued by the argument of which new rules could be necessary to control the communication form from the rooms of the court, something unimaginedable at the time of the case of doctor Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for preoccupation on the impact of new mass media" in processes of high profile, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of the School of Laws of Stanford, that studied the capital punishment of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it said that this one was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal could feel intrigued by the idea that limiting the immediate communication from the rooms of the court she could cause that the judgments were righter.
The question of Twitter is an only one of many of the subjects delineated by the lawyers of Hayes, who probably will be discussed during years, delaying execution.
The lawyers of the defense also affirm, for example, that Hayes could be harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them that the reactions of the potential juries would testearan, showing horrifying photographies to them of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that they were horrified by the photographies of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, of 48 years, and its daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
The lawyers of the defense say that they will also question the consitutionality of the capital punishment and will maintain that the judge incorrectly removed a jury who had criticized the public prosecutors, and whom incorrectly he had pressed for a verdict by his strange decision to order to him to the jury to deliberate during a weekend.
The juries were not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense cover of the process can attract the interest most of.
They observed in a rejection the filed verdict the past month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the mass media continuously threw firewood to the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of tweets of means, the cameras and the reporters outside the court," wrote the lawyers, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all the state."
Its attention in the cover of Tweeter is controverted.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news they were more important that more the slowly given information, were a vision ludita that would do that the policy of the court on the control of the cover was weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appeal courts often felt attracted by the arguments on the adaptation that was required in the courts due to the technological social changes and.
The lawyers of Hayes are pressing by that reclamation.
In its writing, they talked about to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, that revokes the sentence of doctor Sheppard due to the cover of the process, and left in clear that they would demand that the new means would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard case versus. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can the civic-mindedness trend a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign by the invective and the negatividad, this week a little civic-mindedness in Washington has been triggered.
It is an omen of a genuine two-party or a little while false future cooperation before a fast return to the partisan combat in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between president Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any advance in the great subjects that must be treated during the salient session.
But reason why they say all, was at least one courteous discussion on the differences of the two parts, as well as a recognition of his shared responsibilities to govern, instead of being another empty episode to gain partisan points.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the commission of deficit of the president also was civilized, in spite of the political differences that subsist between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction during a period of months generated a mutual respect that extends the ideological breach that still separates to the members.
That is hardly sufficient to declare that a new era has arrived from cooperation.
Now both parts are in a period of test, drilling themselves mutually to identify signs of cooperatism and commitment, while they try to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for one renewed partisan war.
Reason by which the meeting of Tuesday and the later evaluations of the same on the part of the participants took control of an accusation or exigencies minimum of.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and are very deeply ingrained like suggesting any fast change of the climate that existed during last the two years.
Or that is taxes, expenses, medical assistance or social aid, the two parts are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the election of November has smoothed out humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that the things have changed with respect to the way to say the things," said Pete Wehner, a civil servant of the administration of Bush now in center of Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections wake up in favor passions, that soon are extinguished.
That is good."
In some questions, in particular in which they appear in the daily routine of the salient session, the Republicans and Democrats do not have another option that to find a solution.
The reductions of taxes of Bush expire at the end of year, and nobody is in favor of this.
Both parts want to find a way to preserve some or all the reductions, permanently or weather.
In the same way, it is probable that there is a commitment to extend the unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot make think that they are in favor of the reductions of taxes for the rich ones, denying the subsidy of unemployment for the unemployed workers.
After the meeting of Tuesday in the White House, there is major optimism by a possible treatment on these subjects during the salient session, along with the ratification of the new pact of nuclear disarmament START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
Pero William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, notices that the successful cooperation in the urgent questions of the salient session will not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartisanism when new 112do. Congress meets in January.
It affirmed, on the contrary, that it is very probable and until inevitable, that a period of discord begins.
"After the things that are due to do are taken to end, short term psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation" affirmed.
Also Wehner expressed skepticism (which widely is shared) on the fact that the civic-mindedness it can lead to a true cooperation.
"I see most than it will happen now between and 2012 like a test for the main event of 2012," it affirmed.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to their creation.
By more it brings back to consciousness that they have the Republican leaders on the dangers to exaggerate its position, know that they must try to fulfill his promises to trim the expenses of the state and to annul the new law of health.
Those in favor lines already are observed clearly in the initial reactions against the recommendations of the commission of deficits, that include the reform of the tributary code and the increase of some taxes and of the age of retirement, and the cut of expenses.
The co-chairmans Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been in charge of one of the most difficult works in Washington and, according to its own valuation, they have introduced to the force the question of the deficit in the public daily routine of a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission 18 members to publish their plan like an official recommendation, and have been fighting to arrive near that number.
The greater resistance is between the civil servants chosen in the panel, suggesting in fiscal questions has, at least at the moment, few bases or desire for the commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of the Congress.
First the next year in the form of in favor shocks will happen, when the Republicans defy to Obama on the budget, the taxes and the medical care, followed soon by a period of greater two-party cooperation.
What would bring about the change?
The public opinion.
There are considerable tests that, in spite of the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see started off working together both.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will observe with attention the reaction of people.
Whoever they consider that it is probably losing will change course and it will look for commitment.
Nevertheless, this can be an optimistic vision.
The partisanship and the polarization at the moment are majors than they were in the middle of years 1990, and seems to have a greater ideological hollow between Obama and Republicanos of the Congress del that were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 like the mere prelude a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo that is this week can be welcome by many Americans.
But this will require effort from both sides much more to find points common in the questions that still divide them.
A filtered American document portrays to Moscow like the paradise of the corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," and leaves to a part of the bribes and money of protection that it directly collects to the Kremlin, according to informed in February the American Embassy in Russia.
One inquired that as much the police as the Service of Federal Security handles enormous systems of blackmail, which aid to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow.
They collect money not only of legitimate businesses, but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy, which Prime minister Vladimir Putin has denominated the "vertical authority," takes its part as the money raises in the scale.
The note, that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks in its website Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censured.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov still was mayor of Moscow, and he blames it by great part of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed it to October, but there has been little evidence of a cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and its wife, Yelena Baturina, that owns an important company of construction, have systematically denied the accusations of corruption throughout the years, and he has gained several demands by libel on such accusations.
In September, when in a Russian television channel they asked to him on a documentary one that it suggested was corrupt, affirmed: "It is a madness, a lie, an annoyance."
According to the surveys, the Russians create of overwhelming way that its society is corrupt.
But he is unusual to find the explained details in detail, since they were in the report of the embassy, and is incredible that are the diplomats of a foreign country those whom they do that.
"The direct links of the government of the city of Moscow with the criminality have taken some to call it "dysfunctional," and to affirm that the government works more like a kleptocracy than like a government," he affirms the note.
"Elements criminal enjoy "krysha" (a term of the criminal world and the Mafia that literally mean "ceiling" or protection) that transfers the police, the Federal Service of Seguridad (SFS), the Ministry of Internal affairs (mbd), and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as all the sectors of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is in highest."
"the SFS, the mbd and the militia are in the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are in the lowest level."
"This it is an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fill an emptiness in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report affirms that the SFS collects the money of the greatest companies, and than the police it aims at the retail stores.
A source, affirmed the report, "it explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understand that the best thing is to secure the protection of the mbd and SFS (instead of the groups of the organized crime) since they not only have more arms, resources and power that the criminal groups, but are also protected by the law."
"Therefore, the protection against the criminal gangs is not plus a priority."
The note observes that, whereas the money collection is complete, the protection can be irregular\; those that pay are even subject to the arrest.
Those that does not pay quickly find their businesses closed by a pretext or another one.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against the corruption, but it has confessed that has obtained little progress.
The note of the embassy informs on men taking suitcases, probably full of money in cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against the corruption, Medvedev must trust the bureaucrats," it affirmed Georgy Satarov, director of the group of experts of Indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But it is a part of this bureaucracy."
"It does not belong to a political class, because no longer a political class in Russia exists."
Without the policy, without an opposition, a separation of powers, it affirmed, the corruption is inevitable.
On national scale, Indem esteem that the corruption costs to him to Russia more than 300 billions of dollars per year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the Transparency International NGO, the country was classified in position 154 (the countries are classified of less to most corrupt).
The revelation of the note of the American Embassy, that did not happen behind schedule until at night hour of Moscow, surely will cause misfortune within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed by the weaknesses of Moscow, it could be an opportunity so that the Kremlin argues that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed person for the Cnn by Larry King, Putin suggested them WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that affirmed that the American diplomats called it Batman and to Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the subject is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country," affirmed.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would have taken control of such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, that outside done of a so immoral way."
The veterans of the forced Red Khmers to face the past
In a classroom it makes specific weakly illuminated, with stained walls and descascaradas, the director of the Secondary School Anlong Veng remembered the man who had constructed it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Khmers.
"Here all love Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader and he worried about its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, of 42 years.
Known like "the Butcher" by his brutality during the government the Red Khmers, the commander continues being popular in this remote ex- strength of the Red Khmers in the northwest of Cambodia, where she constructed hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where still thousands live on ex- soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers surrendered before the government, loyalty maintained for a long time is finally being defied in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and the reconciliation allowed the victims who faced the people publicly who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a text book of secondary school that teaches the history to him of the Red Khmers for the first time to the children of its ex- soldiers.
And in July, a mixed tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia emitted the first sentence of an ex- member of the Red Khmers, sentencing to the ex- head of the well-known center of torture Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better well-known like Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of those events, the anxiety has grown between the veterans of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng, having complicated the efforts for the reconciliation and its attempts to return to the Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear between the ex- Red Khmers, but they cannot do nothing," it affirmed Chhang Youk, director of the Center of Documentation of Cambodia, an independent organization whom it investigates to the regime.
"For them, the life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of the evil."
"This is generating divisions within the families."
During the government of the Red Khmers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or they died of hunger, disease or excess of work, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnameses invaded and overthrew to the government led by Pol Pot, the rest of the regime and their military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they sent an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December of 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary they directed the war of guerillas from his bases in mountains and the forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok worked followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of years 90, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN lead to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, great groups of soldiers of the Red Khmers began to desert towards the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was caught by forces of the government in 1999 in the near Dangrek Mountains.
It died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while it waited for the process.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest combatants of the Red Khmers fell in the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia by the movement.
Although a few civil servants of elite of the Red Khmers conserved their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their arms, the privates continue being poor and nonqualified farmers.
"This people have obtained few benefits after the surrender," she affirmed to Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and the Reconciliation, that offers forums public by all Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have built-in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were bred without no concept to make businesses."
Sister Lim, of 55 years, who was united to the Red Khmers when she was an adolescent in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before dedicating itself to the life like farmer of poor rice in 1998.
"The life with the Red Khmers was well," it affirmed.
"Ta Mok gave him to eat to all."
"But now the life is difficult because we have autoabastecernos."
The present court of the Red Khmers also has caused preoccupations here.
Earlier next year, it is hoped that the court begins to process to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and its wife, Ieng Thirith, another ex- minister of the Red Khmers.
The mandate of the court is the one to process to the main leaders and those of greater responsibility by the crimes, but it has not said if it will persecute cases besides those four.
This not served as calming the fears in Anlong Veng much.
The recent speculation of means has concentrated in Im Chaem, of 64 years, who was a head of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Khmers at the end of years 1970.
In 2007, she said to him to the investigators of the Center of Documentation of Cambodia that had supervised the construction of the prey of Trapeang Thma, a project about which she thinks that they have died thousand of workers forced.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields to its house on wood piles in a dirt road in the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shades on I graze parched, Im Chaem refused to speak of its past in the Red Khmers.
She affirmed that if the court summoned it would not appear.
"Cambodia is peacefully and stable," it affirmed.
"If there are more processings, there will be war."
Prime minister Hun Sen, who deserted of the Red Khmers in 1978, also has noticed repeatedly that there will be instability if the court persecutes more suspects, although the experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and to bury the past" affirmed.
But to face the past is exactly what Cambodia must make to advance, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to return to unite the broken pieces" affirmed.
"It is our obligation to reunite these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Khmers, call "To History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as I supplement to the text book of history of secondary school of the Ministry of Education, that less than contains four pages on the Red Khmers.
Like in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details on the Red Khmers, in spite of the bond of the city with the regime.
Valeak touch, of 19 years, a student in the Secondary School of Anlong Veng, said that the new text book helped the students to understand an important part of its history.
But their parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book to house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the court and text book," she affirmed.
"They have suspicions because they are not safe on the amount of people whom the court will process."
Such resistance has caused that the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, affirmed Sok Leang.
But the forums public, the text book and the court are beginning to produce an impact, affirmed.
Anyway, the Red Khmers conserve a powerful enchantment here.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a way with too many bad grass and place setting of rejected plastic bags lead to a rectangle of the black soot covered by an oxidized tin plate ceiling.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tires after its death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a salesman of cellular on the brink of madness the way, said that it did not know much on the man who was cremated there.
"But it has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to say," she affirmed to him.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day it decided to walk until the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where it would let a mature banana handful with the hope have good luck.
Belarus accepts to resign to its uranium reserve described for armament
In a surprise victory for the campaign of president Obama to protect the nuclear material anywhere in the world, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that will resign to their reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of the nuclear weapons.
The treatment was developing in a joint statement published after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Byelorussian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov, besides a security summit.
For years, the American government had been trying to persuade to Belarus that he resigned to his highly enriched uranium and seemed that they had arrived at a point without return the past spring.
But the American civil servants said to him to Washington Post who both carried out a pair of operations classified with Belarus in last months, to retire 84.82 kg of uranium described for armament of a Byelorussian installation of investigations.
This prepared the land for the agreement of Wednesday to retire the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a civil servant, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear safety of 47 nations presided by Obama in April, that excluded Belarus.
And by the sight it was a good manage to assure the invitation the ex- Soviet republic to the following summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated because they wanted a place in the Summit of Nuclear safety of 2012."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," it affirmed Ken Luongo, president of the Society for the Global security, a group that promotes the nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" dice by Belarus.
In April of 2009 Obama promised in the Prague anywhere in the world to protect all the vulnerable nuclear material in next the four years.
Since then, the American government has helped to six countries to undo of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit of Nuclear safety of Obama, the Byelorussian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared who the nation never would resign to its uranium.
"We have conserved the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms than basically Uranian it is described for armament) and uranium of low enrichment," affirmed then Lukashenko.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to be sold them to anybody."
"We used It with investigation aims, is everything."
Nevertheless, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The civil servants affirmed that the first task of retiring uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, since the material slightly had been radiated.
The civil servants said that he was loaded in a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
According to the civil servants, the second operation finalized Monday and was conducted in airplane.
The American government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide to Belarus the installation to him of investigations with uranium of low enrichment, that is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a civil servant of the Department of Energy that works in the Reduction of Global Threat, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated by far taken care of to fortify the confidence" that it lead to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin for Center Nonproliferation Studies considered this year that Belarus owned at least 40 kilograms of uranium described for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve towards 2012, according to the joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense per years, mainly due to the rough repression of Lukashenko of the human rights.
But the declaration of Wednesday suggested a potential distension.
It was declared that "while the progress in these questions of global security take refuges with affability, the United States and Bielorrusia recognized that a greater respect by the democracy and the human rights in Belarus continues being a central subject to improve the bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not put repairs to the flights of the company
The Spanish Government did not put repairs to the flights of the company with prisoners talibans and Al-Qaeda in the direction of Guantánamo by Spanish territory, according to expressed in a telegram the ambassador of the USA in Madrid.
Thus the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the El País newspaper reflect it, where it is added that then the vice-president first of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive was informed for "being able to demonstrate that they exerted an appropriate monitoring on the foreign airplanes that cross Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in opposite practices to the human rights to a dozen of countries, among them Spain, took place a meeting between the ex- North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez of the Fertile valley.
The vice-president recognized that the report of the Council "had taken to the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted on which Spain did not have anything to hide in this subject.
"Of the Fertile valley it emphasized that Spain does not have repairs to the flights of intelligence through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid "to be pillaged off guard," relates Aguirre in a cable.
Also then to title of Exteriors, Miguel Moratinos Angel, he indicated to the ambassador who the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this subject the profile more under possible, although, when being in the hands of the judges, the Government had one limited influence capacity."
On the other hand, in January of 2007, public prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that would not try to block the initiative of the judge to request the declassification of documents of the National Center of Inteligencia (CNI) and of the ministry of Defense on the flights of the company
"These information do not contain any incriminatory element nor any sensible information," explained the Embassy after speaking with the public prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the USA reflected their preoccupation by the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the public prosecutors German," more than by the declassified information of the CNI or the ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case between Governments discreetly," is sorry Aguirre.
In March of 2007 in a lunch between the ambassador of the USA and minister of the Interior, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, this one commented to him that "although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider suitable," he had given instructions to their collaborators "so that they avoided commentaries of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to reduce the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his preoccupation by the action of the PARTIDO POPULAR in this subject.
"In spite of its proAmerican general direction, our experience suggests the PARTIDO POPULAR will not doubt in capitalizing any indication of which the Government of Zapatero tolerated deliberately or ignored actions of the USA that could be interpreted like possible violations of the human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the USA," indicate.

The messages belong to 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know its sentimental life, that ABC reconstructs through testimonies of relatives his.

When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to drill the labor market, the small one remained with its pair, that even got to accompany it one week to Palm.
But by the content of the communications, one sees that its romance fractured, that broke.
In March of 2008 it is in Menorca, single, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and annoyed, because I have come to work."

The last man who coexisted with her, armed security guard, declares his grief to feel guilty.
It does not want to think that everything has happened through not having counted him to him that she was single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday in penitentiary the provincial one of Palm, coming from the center of judicial prisoners of Menorca.
The Carlos, appointed counsel Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "nor to have had intention to cause some badly to the minor."
Before, yes it confessed that it had drowned to Caesar in the bathtub and deposited its corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the public prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
The popular ones would gain 4 benches in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PARTIDO POPULAR could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase of delegated votes and experienced in the recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PARTIDO POPULAR or it has the view put in the generals then, is advance or no, the perspective are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles to that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, popular the Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, whereas in the autonomic ones of 2006, the number ascended to 316.222.
The past Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
to stay this tendency to the rise, that has been nourished of a transfer of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PARTIDO POPULAR, analysts of this formation have calculated who, if general elections were celebrated, the PPC could happen of 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, whereas CiU would also gain four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would state that the Catalan place is fundamental for PARTIDO POPULAR and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular ones, ERC would lose a deputy - now it has three - whereas ICV would remain with a deputy or would gain one.
But, to stay the electoral calendar, the immediate appointment will take place in May of 2011 with the local elections, where the popular ones can also be decisive in the aim of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of province and their relief to the front of the Delegation of Barcelona, one of the administrations that more estimating handles - 661 million Euros for 2011 -.
Nationalistic as as much popular they agree in the possibility that the PSC loses the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain majority nor possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican fiasco, he would not be preposterous that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelonian Town hall - it is needed to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PARTIDO POPULAR has increased their number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of being able to carry out the upset in the tarraconense capital, where they governed with the PARTIDO POPULAR before the present socialist mayor, Josep Felix Crossbowmen.
In Lérida, the PARTIDO POPULAR has been placed only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintain very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were in several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At the moment, the PARTIDO POPULAR is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
Besides the seven stopped in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven pakistanis and the Nigerian stopped by agents of the General Police station of Information of the Police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups from Al Qaida, among them "the Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author this last one of the attacks of Bombay that caused the death to 106 people in 2008.
The Department of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, until the point to assure that with the "Kampai operation" it has been "debilitated" equipment of falsification of Al Qaida at international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in both years that are been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands from passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and soon distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that their "combatants" can cross the European borders and of other western countries with total impunity.
The destamantelada cell is not the unique one that the jihadist network had operative in Europe, for that reason in the investigations they have participated, besides the Thailander services, other European police units, reason why it does not discard that in territory of the EU blows similar to the developed one at night of Tuesday in Barcelona are the past carried out in the next days.
In coordination with this operation (the pakistanis Junaid Humayun were stopped, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand it was developed to another one with the capture of the pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thailander Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were those that directed from Bangkok the cell seated in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of her was struck in 2009 - mainly robbed to tourists passports that fulfilled the requirements marked by "In front World-wide" the Islamic call.
That is to say, the documents had to be in the name of men among 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In means of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, has not been any data that ties to the arrested ones in Catalonia with the attack of Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba," he has been one of the receiving groups of the passports robbed in Spain and soon falsified in Thailand.
However, it is possible to remember that days before outside committed this attack, from Catalonia were sent through an agency of transferences about thousand dollars that "were invested" in the card purchase of mobiles that soon were used by the members of the "commando" who it ended the life of 106 people.
The Police has seized itself of abundant documentation.
The PARTIDO POPULAR demands to But that it parks the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sanchez-Camacho, had occasion yesterday to personally set out to Artur Mas his conditions to him to support his investiture like president of the Catalan Autonomous Government, identical to already raised during the campaign and that summary in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and doing without adventures edge-pro-sovereignty partisans, like is the economic agreement that the nationalistic leader wants to raise in the Equator of his mandate.
The president of popular the Catalans went to the encounter of Artur Mas with the security that it the past gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections of Sunday, number more than sufficient to be made want, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formation that will exert the opposition abstains in the investiture voting.
On the possible restrictive practice with the PARTIDO POPULAR the future alliances depend that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are celebrated, but, at the moment, the conversations that these days maintain But with the rest of political leaders become in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PARTIDO POPULAR, to support an investiture "it will be necessary to park all the pro-sovereignty and pro-independence speeches," as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even tries to put under referendum.
Both leaders yes have common their bet to thin political equipment of an autonomic administration very inflated and the elimination of the tax of successions and donations.
Of the details of the negotiation on the investiture of But they will take care, on the part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But that has met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - promised an opposition lasts -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Creek (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Catalan Solidaritat).
The geriatrical one affirms that the deaths were not by "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not discard that his watchman killed to more than 11 old ones
The people in charge of geriatrical the Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to put of relief the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct to him of Joan I saw it Dilmé, the nurse who while there he was used killed at least to eleven old ones that he had to his position.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied of the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Gorge, and announced that "the desire of the Caritat would be to be able to exert the accusation against the person in charge" of the deaths but "the legality and the responsibility force to us to assume the procedural situation of civil people in charge."
And it is that besides the social loss of prestige that can undergo the organization by not to have detected in time the criminal activities of the watchman, the great threat for the Caritat receives now forms of substantial indemnification that already is calculating the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Saw it Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August of 2009 and that since then has not stopped killing.
The judge already aimed in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the geriatrical one - whom that suspected in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceaseds but, taking care of the age and the pathologies of the patients, dispatched the proceeding by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, denied fully this end yesterday and aimed that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any moment the cause than has happened."
The lawyer of the Caritat added that "in the cause there is no a single indication that has been an imprudent action on the part of any other person who is not the own one imputed."
Already baptized as "Angel of the Death" confessed 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed it the 29 of August of 2009 for, a month and a half later, to kill one second grandmother.
In this case an insulin overdose brought about the death puncturing to him, unlike the first crime that committed it helping itself of a mixture of sedative tablets.
The director of the Caritat aims that he is complicated to control that the personnel of the center has access to medecines.
The punctures of insulin and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the interns, used to give death them.
But they will be the analyses that are becoming in the laboratory those that they will have to clarify if Saw it does not lie and it looked for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, it burnt giving them on the inside them lye like already has confessed that did with the three women who killed between the 12 and the 17 of October.
In the Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the watchman, nor so at least to the number of confessed murders, that do not discard that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that it has given I saw it in its visits the court and in little felt which it has changes its way of coming after to have committed, successfully, eight murders.
It is why they say that they are put at the disposal of justice to clarify the reach of this event.
The BCE threatens
The investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the threat yesterday of Trichet that noticed "the markets do not have to underestimate our capacity of reaction."
The differentials of peripheral have closed with force and the actions of the European banks have raised more of 5%.
However, we do not have either to underestimate the capacity of the BCE to be mistaken and the Euro as soon as it has begun to appear which is a worrisome signal.
What one has taken place yesterday is own of an unliquidated market that just as collapses recovers but motivated by closing of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take in losing the fear.
A month ago the BCE mentioned to us today to retire liquidity measures and it will have to tomorrow retract by fourth time in two years and those that are.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalize the plan of purchase of ineffective national debt by and eliminating all the extraordinary measures of liquidity on credit and leaving only limitless access to week.
After the Irish crisis we hoped that they prorogue the present measures of liquidity "until March" and at least maintain the quarterly auction with limitless access at the end of the trimester to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
Also we hoped that they even continue with its program of bond purchase and that signals to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the generated expectations they will revert the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they follow blinded in retiring liquidity measures, that God attends to us!
Like in its meeting of May in that they affirmed that neither they had not contemplated the bond purchase and they collapsed the markets, tomorrow history could be repeated.
The BCE must be credible and persistent.
In May it announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday it said that already it had bought much, bringing about a new collapse of the market.
The auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor yesterday.
The Treasure only emitted 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points in all the curve, reflecting clearly a change of market feeling after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, one has become public the numbers of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The considered numbers are about 10,000 short term million and other 15,000 potentials and must until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are feasible within the Plan of Aid and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government will have to secure the parliamentary approval of his new budget and not yet he has sufficient support, reason why Ireland continues being an uncertainty center.
Angela Merkel is moderate the tone of its speech to relax the tension facing the next Summit of Government and Chiefs of State the 14 of December in that a political commitment is necessary that it demonstrates that we are a union and that all we touched the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch to Wagner and the rest the hymn of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity when presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will approve Friday the Cabinet.
The Reformation of pensions, financial transparency in autonomous regions and organizations, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate the use sounds in ears of the investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explain that stock-market Spanish has raised 4.5%, the double that the rest of European Bags.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and forceful and we are benefitting from the effect surprise.
Today there is a key auction of a bond to three years that will see beneficiary by the Trichet effect reason why we hoped that it is solved with fort it demands and it helps to dissipate the doubts on our capacity of refinancing.

The president of Eulen will oppose meeting Sicily the Fertile valley requested by his children
The weather does not lessen in the conflict opened in the family Alvarez, proprietors of Eulen and the Juniper.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will oppose, when null considering it "ipso jure," the judicial meeting of the Juniper of next day 16, solicitd by five of his seven children and in whom they will try to make merit his majority and to take control of the management organs of the signature to title of Warehouses Vega Sicily.
David Alvarez and his children Jesus David and Maria Jose are sharpening the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation by the control from the group.
The founder of the greater holding company of enterprise services to the company does not seem arranged to yield in his litigation to be present in the control systems of the Juniper.
Of its advice of administration it was dismounted by five of its seven children who appointed administrators in the assembly of shareholders of 18 of January of this year and whose opposition is written down in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial meeting of the Juniper for next day 16, summoned by the magistrate of Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the thunderclaps in the family Alvarez.
The resource to the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is solved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the call of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez like a "desperate resource as the applicants its five children for, by means of procedural hair-splitting, in clear fraud of Law and abuse right, to try to confirm and to adjust the radically null meeting of the 18 of January," according to its official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the base so that, once held the meeting, it comes to his opposition when considering that she is "null ipso jure."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, already tried without success that the magistrate summoned in June a meeting.
In the Juniper, patrimonial and titular society of Warehouses Vega Sicily, among others active, the seven children of David Alvarez control the 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group protests, nevertheless, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This subject is the basic question that must decide the judge once is celebrated the view on the demand of opposition, for that still is no indicated date.
Red Bull prevails in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in the cars in real time.
Ever since Red Bull burst in into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of the speed been has marked by the surprise and the success.
Initially nobody considered the options from a motor-racing team just arrival and, in spite of the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the final straight line of the championship all bet by the triumph of the Ferrari of the Fernando Alonso.
Without finally being inferior the ability like pilot of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor either of the capacity of the Renault motor that drives its car, the world of Formula 1 the "secret weapon" has not become a legend that the Siemens multinational has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning equipment.
One is in fact a powerful software of simulation of processes that the German put in the market in 2007 with aims very moved away of the high automobile competition.
Denominated plm, this powerful computer science instrument it has been used anywhere in the world to design production lines of manufacturing factories, plants of energy, instruments of high precision.
The objective is to reproduce, to simulate of faithful form the product or the process before constructing it of real mode, avoiding this way avoidable failures and expenses.
Plm has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi or the more famous utilitarian cars of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer science instrument in its factory of Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull to design and to take to effect "in a few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the motor-racing teams in year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their equipment who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during every season.
In the equipment of Red Bull 180 professional young people of high qualification work today who, equipped with powerful computer science equipment, analyze and project all luck of modifications in bolides.
The manager of Siemens explained that to software plm he is able to analyze and to improve all the elements of bolides of Red Bull except the motor, that is of the whole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the elements of security modify.
The changes can be taken less than of the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems by means of laser and sterilizers of high tech.
As only limitation of this madness of the technological improvement is the number of 40 million dollars that each equipment of Formula 1 can spend at the most in every season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high tech factory to design and to produce its bolides in a locality to about 50 kilometers of London.
One is two buildings in which is restricted the visits, especially for journalists.
Everything what occurs there is considered "high secret."
The group for this assignment promotes 580 people, including its two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of drinks energetics has put to the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists hide whose contest is inestimable and their null notoriety.
The head of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, affirms that five years ago it was possible to be affirmed that the advances of R+D in the cars of carts contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentage have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber never will be replaced by computer science since "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributers
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive store in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This it will be first of the network of 20 commerces among 80 and 100 meters square that the multinational anticipates to install in Spain during next the two years.
The company will make compatible this initiative with the 16 already present areas in centers marking like PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and the English Cut.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Greek Blacksmith, put as example the remodeled store located in the Great Barcelonan Route, property of Pont Reyes, with that collaborates for 30 years.
The North American group is preparation a plan to locate 200 points of sale name brand in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
First in opening they were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the last week, being the one of Barcelona the third party.
Blacksmith did not want to keep awake the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the following destiny.
Also the director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will be always the same, leaning in a local distributer with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group adviser and is in charge of exclusive the moving design of the stores (with products that can be touched of interactive form), that in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the formation with the personnel to the establishments.
Greek Blacksmith denied that he was a system of franchise and emphasized that the exclusive network of commerces tries "to improve the service to the client and the SMEs in the purchase, the attention, posventa and even the packing."
The store of Barcelona includes a space with a pioneering pilot program at world-wide level that is in charge to solve the possible problems of the computer science equipment of HP in guarantee.
A service online connects with a located technical center in the Maastricht (Holland).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can resolve problems that sometimes can take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since the great companies already have contracted services of technical attendance," Greek Blacksmith observed yesterday.
Sabadell bets "to rob" a million clients to its rivals in three years
More optimist than other managers, the delegated adviser of Sabadell Bank, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but discards initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the aim of the war of the liabilities.
In spite of it, it anticipates a collapse of the margins of interests, that will be tried to compensate partly with ascents of commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell hopes to catch in three years a million particular clients, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a route to operate the three next years and power thus to survive in very complicated economic surroundings.
The bank will start up in 2011 a new plan director who will have a use of three years.
The objective, besides surviving without needing resorting to the public aid of the FROB, is to gain market share with the pick up of a million new particular clients -700,000 if those discount that can leave the bank, their great pending subject, since until now it had pampered more to the SMEs and companies that to the retail client.
This year has caught 250,000 particular clients and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is of 3.5%, whereas in companies surpasses 10%.
Another one of the bases of plan 2011-2013 is the bet by the productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduction of costs like objective, and whose challenges will exhibit the present bank when the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to pay attention some objectives and to make them public since the financial crisis has switch over all the plans of the world-wide bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its plan Optimum director, fixed for four years, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets did that an exercise will extend it more.
The clients who let save the savings banks will be their main objective.
On a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola it insisted on which 2011 are going to be "a difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create job," something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although it thinks that the war of the liabilities - that penalize the margins is being reduced, the price of the risk cousins who are paying banks and boxes by their emissions to obtain liquidity are moving already at the cost of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The subject of the liquidity and the financing is structural, and is going to be a pressure factor on the credit."
"We have not closed the faucet, but the differentials are higher," recognized Guardiola.
Banesto already issued to Thursday orders to its network so that they limit the long-term credit and they raise the price of the differentials - to see CincoDías of 22 and 27 of November.
Also it recognized that the tendency of the bank now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive frame."
The plan director of Sabadell is based on the organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporative operations.
Not in vain, it assures that in Spain "they are going away to require sizes majors."
"Next year one is going away to move everything," it assured.
It affirms that the capital needs "are raised very many" and it does not discard that some Spanish financial organization enters red numbers.
And it aims that the FROB can replace to the market in the pick up of bottoms before new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closing of the markets, it reduced importance to which some bankers predict already like a new crisis of liquidity.
It indicates that it is not possible to be emitted, but unlike which it happened in June, is possible to be obtained short term financing through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The MINT discards one second big wave of fusions in the boxes
The general director of the MINT, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that a big wave of fusions of savings banks is going to take place and returned to insist on the speed with which the reconstruction of the sector is being executed.
When it took the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, the organizations were several that assured that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would be reserved for the second round.
Nevertheless, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings banks (MINT), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that this new big wave of operations is going to take place.
"I believe that the greatest part of the fusions has become, the incorporation of Cajasol to the group of Civic Bank cannot be said that it is one second round, which is are adjustments."
"Most completely is done\; perhaps instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have become or and had the charge of by the Bank of Spain, that in that has collaborated very many also," it pointed the manager.
In declarations during a breakfast of the Manager Association and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the concentration process is being undertaken "at the greater possible speed, and we must be very satisfied with how it is taken place in the terms which at the time, not now, they were marked in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain," emphasized.
"To happen of 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million it is a process that does not have comparison in history, reducing the number of organizations in a 62% so that they are much more great to fulfill Basel," it stood out.
Olavarrieta recognized that "a series of opinions rather little lucky exists on the slowness of the process" that they demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense," because "what makes the Bank of Spain is to remember that we must be within the term before the end of year."
The general director of the MINT, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the more rigorous financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world, and attributed to those who puts it in judgment fabric a "lack of knowledge."
The manager pointed that, within the present economic conjuncture, "we can be very calm" with the situation of the financial organizations and the savings banks, a system that has undertaken "a most important" process of the concentration and that "it goes to the greater possible speed."
Also it remembered that the Spanish bank came out shutdown very well the stress tests that the BCE realized in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the Euro, but it has established the conditions for all the Union.
The tensions in the markets have brought about one double governmental answer.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new measures of adjustment, from tax cuts to the SMEs, regulation of private agencies of positioning or suppression of the 426 Euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and the Prat and of 30% of Lotteries of the State.
On the other, vice-president Elena Salgado, with the support of ex-president Felipe González, has added herself to the critics to the cancillera Angela Merkel by her responsibility in untying the present crisis.
How it is necessary to interpret those movements?
It goes ahead that the position of Merkel is not an error in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another return of nut in the difficult process of redefinition of the Euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision than it must be his future, that hits the one to maintain the old traditions of good part of its partners.
Against the European resistance, in Germany it begins to speculate on itself on the three possible exits to the crisis.
First, a strong Euro, integrated by she herself, Austria and Holland, among others countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
Second, the recovery of the frame, although now seems science fiction, with a current of opinion very favorable, near 50% of the population.
Third, a redesign of the Euro, in line with the Germanic proposals from greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the countries transgressors, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and comes for a long time defining itself, so now excuses do not fit.
First, in the 2009, when as much the IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government removed from the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them as of the 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between which Germany thought that it had to become (plans strictly speaking fiscal and stability in public finances), and what their European partners were practicing, including France.
Second in the forehead the Central European country gave it when Merkel laboriously extended the decision of rescue of Greece.
Then it was already object of ferocious critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one was very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel it emerges again with a clear position, demanding the reform of treaties of the Union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force the deprived moneylenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted like anti-European, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and all the others.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the next months, we would have to attend the process of reform of the Union that makes possible those measures as of the 2013.
Germany has drawn up a red line that does not think to cross.
And it is saying to us to all which, although now there are to take measures with which it perhaps does not agree very, as of that one date the old operation of the Euro, will have been finished.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries violators severely will be sanctioned, can be forced to declare itself in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector also will run with part of the cost.
Germany is indicating to us that we must follow a severe way of growth with lifted rates of saving and investment, outer moderation in the consumption, improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and positive balances.
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction, with enormous holes in the balance of payments, like which it has presided over the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply is not going it to tolerate.
The push is clearly.
And we would do bad in not understanding it.
It is not only tried to lead back the public deficit to 3% in the 2013.
What they demand to us is much more hard.
And the worse thing than in these circumstances we could do is to deceive to us same.
I hope that the present turbulences open the way to a greater tranquility.
And that we take advantage of the window opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of the 2013.
It seems that president Zapatero also has understood it thus and its manifest double (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the great companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures) suggests, in spite of the critics to Merkel, has laid way the thesis of which is to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn up there is, and it does not seem that they are going it to move.
And, between the possibilities that are contemplated, the one to leave a too much stuffed monetary zone of little serious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany always will be able to say to us that it had already warned to us.
Sport and fraud of law
Tricks as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate I devise but will not to escape to a sanction.
The expulsion presumably plotted by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the disputed party the 23 of November against the Ajax in the League of Champions has caused who are written red rivers about if such behavior he is or nonunsportsmanlike and if, possibly, both players had to be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As well he is known, for want of some minutes to finish the party (that his team already knew clearly cattle), both players wasted deliberately time at the time of removing to footpaths lack to cause that the referee showed the second yellow card to them.
Of that way, and since already Real Madrid will finish like leader of its group, both players they will fulfill the prescribed sanction the next party of the minor league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to happen clean of cards to the following phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two parties the trainer of the team, Jose Mourinho, and with different economic amounts from the implied players.
The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this or is not a new practice, but rather frequents in the world of soccer.
So it is extended that it comprises of the ethos, of the rules written, but nonfollowed, of this sport.
Part of the debate arisen in the related case is due to that it has been carried out by an equipment of the organization of the Real Madrid (that in its hymn presumes of nobility and honor, and that sometimes happened has fined to its players by analogous acts) and to the orchestrated dramatisation, apparently, by Mourinho, that adds an episode more his expanded history of theatric and provoking technician.
In any case, the debate turns around if that type of behavior prohibited specifically by the regulation does not contradict the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions law fraud is committed\; then, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sport regulation, but they seem to elude its sense.
The question happens to examine the type of damage that brings about the sport spirit.
One of the goods that understand the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions did not put in danger, that is to say, there was no violent game.
Another one of these goods to which it is alluded to with the fare-play is to avoid that the team of the players violators takes advantage unjust way of the opposite equipment, something that did not happen either.
However, the paradoxical thing of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to which normally we characterized like trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not made secretly to try to avoid the sanction, but indeed its action tried to be most evident thus to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited for and they accepted the sanction with pleasure.
Another question is what type of advantage obtains the violators in the examined deliberate lack.
Here it seems necessary to state that it is not placed in disadvantageous situation the rival nor obtains benefit in the same party, because evidently the result of the action supposes to leave to the own team with the less players.
And it is not either a useful strategy for the next party, because the club will not be able to have those players.
The advantage, obvious, consists of which the players will begin the following phase of the League of Champions without cards that can threaten their participation in the future divided.
But one is a long term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated first of change, and in addition this action the players fulfill a sanction party and happen to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle.
So that, to be passing rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
, Those actions really do not go against the sport spirit, del that yes comprises to make strategic decisions that they favor to remove the maximum benefit than they allow the rules.
Supposing that he occupies to us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this yes would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to be put under her.
They made a strategic decision without drawing for the punishment nor fleeing from the same.
Although the border between I devise and the law fraud is diffuse, in this occasion I believe that it was a clear case of I devise.
The controversy, seems to me, arises by two factors: because one was two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which the transmission of the directive took to end to cause them.
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as esthetic.
Offensive of supplies to catch Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for days 16 and 17.
The celebrations autosufragadas by the employees proliferate, who want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros.
Like nougat and the lottery, with the December arrival they also return previous group dinners to Christmas, that continue exerting of oxygen ball for the restoration and the leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis has ended at an offensive of fit prices to be able to catch the majority client: all almost want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros in dinners or meals, agree the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
In order to finish complicating the accounting, the calendar of this year (when falling the New Year's Eve in Friday) is concentrate the requests in the week of the 13 of December, with the result to date of an avalanche of reserves of dinners for days end (16 and 17) and hardly movement for the previous week.
As it already comes happening from the 2008, when the stage of skinny cows began, are many the companies that have eliminated collective dinners by budgetary question.
Not to do without the tradition, many workers maintain it paying of their own pocket.
Whatever conjuncture, everyone demand prices of battle, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer's association, to day of today, does not dare to predict how they will be the celebrations of this month.
"People think it long before reserving."
"It wants to go out but it has the alert ignited in the subject of the prices," it aims.
The business will go well "to which gives expensive quality and with good service," adds, and remembers that the clients trend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the strip around the 25 Euros has become majority the demand.
In a sounding in diverse centric establishments the request collapse is stated for the night of the 17.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretension to spend 30 Euros less than, to which they have responded adapting its menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 Euros.
In another one of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Inn of the Rita, Market, the Boardinghouse and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has entailed more anticipated reserve, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible thing to maintain same the prices of the year last, with menus for all the tastes from 19.95 to 30 Euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, that register the Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and until a total of the 23 premises, optimists stay after detecting a height of the invoicing from the second semester and some good, although concentrated, perspective of business for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18 also will be a hyperactive day concerning friendly groups that precelebrate the celebrations.
To his six menus of group they have added one Christmas one, with the 30 Euros or more as estimated star and the perception of which there is predisposition to spend a 10% more than the year last in exchange for demanding more details, as it digs.
Also they see green buds in some companies that return to invite their employees and sensation of which the volume of the groups is something greater.
On the part of the Fecasarm employer's association (that includes organizations like the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts beginning to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that altogether the reserves "are animated," although the clients "negotiate to the maximum."
That yes, the illusion by the celebrations has not descended, pays that pays, indicates.
The pakistani nuclear program generates great restlessness in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons to "a rate faster than any other country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the bonds between the talibans and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of the USA leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous restlessness that the pakistani nuclear program brings about in Washington.
Besides the enlightening and substantial details that offer on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the credited North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in the matter of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a rate faster than any other country of the world."
The particularitity of the pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but they remain stored by components to make difficult his destruction in case of attack-- it constitutes one of the main reasons of sleeplessness in Washington.
Thus the ambassador in Pakistan enumerates it, Anne W. Patterson, in a previous report to the visit of then the adviser of National Security, James Jones: "The proximity from some nuclear facilities to territory under attack taliban, the rumored dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and the programs of missiles is contemplated, not only by the USA, but also by Russia, like proliferante and reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has had to engage personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities\; given the fall of the educative and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear programs or of missiles," the expert Yuri Korolev said, of the Russian Ministry of Exteriors, in a meeting with his homologous Americans.
Most novel of the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange it is the decreasing cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high pakistani rate of production of nuclear weapons.
An office of the embassy in May, that describes as "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, maintains: "The transparency is frequently nonexistent\; the supplies of aid are without answer or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of National Intelligence for the south of Asia, state that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a rate faster than any other country of the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks to Washington, during a visit of the head of the Army, general Ashfaq Kayani, that leaves "very clearly" the person in charge who "the Army of Pakistan must end the tacit support to the terrorist groups."
To the hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high person in charge of the antiterrorist fight to avoid new filtrations.
INTERPOL emits a red alert with the purpose of to follow the movements and to locate to Assange where it is.
All that with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
INTERPOL yesterday emitted a "red alert" for "locating and following the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, one is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, she is not new, but it dates from the 20 of November.
And it does not have to do with the last filtration of more of a quarter of million diplomatic documents of the USA but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian confronts in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police knows where and how to put itself in contact with Mr. Assange."
It was day 20 when international the police body with headquarters in Lyons (France) issued the order to request of Sweden, but it did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus the things, the 188 countries of INTERPOL have indications to identify or to locate to Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition."
Although the INTERPOL cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, according to has explained the organization, yes consider the call network notice free route to come to an arrest --that it must undertake the national body of police, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where one thinks that it is Assange.
The movement are indignant the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, has been arranged to be responsible for videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange solicitd and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the public prosecutor of its case, to which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This seems a hunting, not a legal persecution," denounces the letter.
While the world looks for it - and from Australia her mother defends the innocence of her son-- Assange follows in whereabouts unknown, but not shut up.
Monday granted from an indetermine place an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which it requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to be shown that he was responsible to order to American diplomats who spied in the UN violating tried international that the USA has signed, it would have to resign," said.
Its opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
"I am not absolutely safe why the opinion of a type with a webpage must concern us," it declared to chain Cnn.
Own Obama has ordered to a high person in charge of the antiterrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document flights.
The attempt of the spokesman of president Barack Obama to reduce importance to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days conservative politicians and commentators proclaim.
Peter King, the congressman who as of January will preside over the Committee of National Security in the House of Representatives, has asked to the Department of State that studies the possibility of including to Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to take part and its bottoms and to persecute to which of any contribution or it helps them."
More far still Tom Flanagan, an adviser of Canadian president Stephen Harper has gone, whom she has had to retract after saying that Assange would have "to be assassinated."
"Obama would have to turn it into objective and to use an airplane nonmanned or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, minister baptist, exgobernador of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Who he is in the Government the one who leaked the information is guilty of treason and any thing that is not the execution would be a too amiable punishment," it declared in the Fox chain.

Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the prescription to draw for the nth internal revolt in the ERC rows, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is conscious that its threat of resignation is insufficient for the relatives by marriage when exlíder Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of that sector today is so diluted as its own mentor and who absolutely can cause the worries to him that he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to gain to the new critics with winks that allow him to armor themselves until the local elections.
In order to begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC they will be able to be pronounced privily on his continuity.
By means of problems, and not by hand raised.
If the carodistas want to carry certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do it without fear to retaliation.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the division image as much as the one of submission to his person.
In several interviews, it affirmed that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without needing percentage, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The next ones to Carod demand to the president something more than to put their position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But when not having the majority sufficient to force resignations, they are going to try to decide with the executive a trip ticket from now until May.
For it, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the document of strategic reorientation that the direction will put under voting of the national advice day 18.
Its intention is to guarantee to Puigcercós in exchange for which this it promises to advance the congress to autumn of the 2011, something that the dome already gives by fact.
The ERC leader recognized that the "polyphony" harms the stability and that its objective is to do that, once and for all, the organization is able to wash the dirty rags of doors towards inside.
In this line, is symptomatic the article that the minister in functions Josep Huguet signed in its blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació gave by fact that the leader will be authenticated "in exchange for diverse objectives."
And it enumerated five, of that they emphasize two.
First, "to recompose" the executive so that it represents 90% of the militancy at least, that is to say, to include new faces that come from the compatible sector to Carod.
The second can be the great newness.
Huguet proposes that ERC in one go eliminates the asambleísmo like operation mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows to celebrate the congresses through delegates chosen by suffrage.
To end the asambleario model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, that already battled in this sense in both last congresses.
In fact, the convulsed conclave of the 2008 let the order to the direction review the asambleísmo in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment follows slope, because the internal tide of the last years advised against to confront the subject.
Now, without sectors critics on the lookout, it can be a good moment to retake it and to try to close it for always.

"One is an independent decision of the Commission of Order of Sonant."
"Mr. Espino has his right to go, where appropriate, via claim to the Commission of Order of the National Council, of way like is a decision taken in the scope of a competent organ," he wrote down.

Nava Vázquez was said convinced that National Action will leave fortified the internal election of next 4 and 5 of December, in that will be to choose itself to its successor.
"That (an alliance in the 2012) is a subject that never was in the negotiation table, at least not so far, it was an exposition for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective," it referred.

It promotes Obama in Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree that to approve the law Dream Act he is the appropriate thing, it calls to your senators and urges them to approve is legislation," tweeteó the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama added himself today to the national mobilization in support to the law Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree that to approve the law Dream Act he is the appropriate thing, it calls to your senators and urges them to approve is legislation," tweeteó Obama.
Its brief message maintains open a cybernetic liaison with a document ampler than it asks the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that delay is happened soon, now it is the moment for causing that your voice is listened to," indicates.
The message was disclosed after the 42 republican senators threatened blocking the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of cuts of taxes of the era Bush and the funding of the government is approved.
Such blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the law Dream Act and other projects like the ratification of new treaty START with Russia against proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the blockade republican to the law Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once resolute the fiscal subject, will be able to be determined a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe that there is long time..."
"All we agreed in that we must solve the fiscal subject before year end..."
"I believe that we can obtain an agreement in that at some time and later we can plan the sequence of the rest," said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that would request a "vote of closing of debate" for the law Dream Act, thus the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted as of the next Thursday in the Senate, although the next week is more probable.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or law of American Sueño would legalize to about 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the 16 years, they have remained in the country last the five years and entered to an institution of education superior or the army.
But those in favor require 60 votes to approve the initiative, thus require the contest of a handful of republicans, at moments that in favor organizations of the project carry out an intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the law.
The democrats, most of which the Dream Act supports, count on 58 benches.
Nevertheless at least one of them, senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, has said that it will vote against, and only a republican has expressed his support to the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
For this reason, those in favor of the Dream Act require to add several republicans in case other democrats decide to give the back to the initiative.
Between the courted republicans more they are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the salient senator George Lemieux, of Florida, that completed the mandate of senator Mel Martinez.
Other republicans who supported the past in the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they have declared that will not endorse it in another occasion.
Another republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this moment.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the majors obstacles in the Senate.
With Literature they put the finger in the sore
The second round of the pleasures of the language was a stroll where the participants displayed the narration
"That of sex in the language I understand it but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me? ," inquired the writer Luisa invited Valenzuela to open the second round of the pleasures of the language, cycle that celebrates to Literature in Spanish and who this occasion used the subtitle of its question (in another fair the round table she was dedicated to sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the sore... "it puts to us in jams," fired sweetly the Argentine writer to the public, mainly of young people, who occurred to appointment in the Fair the International of Libro de Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and who Shultz would define later as a great story, with Luisa in first person like the protagonist who in search of the knowledge which is the "sore," it goes of doctor in doctor, from whom it does not obtain answers yes although tracks in the same narrative thread.
The infectólogo it leaves convinced: perhaps "the patience is not my fort, is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist that has robbed him the breath in half of the corridor, but that clarifies to him that it injures it is not a scientific term\; she is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real thing opened, the symbolic thing is the scar."
The protagonist sighed alleviated and concluded "of the sore I only managed to know that the real thing is opened and that does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the language must go very mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exhibited a delightful narration that titled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the sore does not name but in a while it is discovered.
On brush-strokes of magical realism, it counts of a famous witch, who the same touched clouds, brought of return to men who had gone away far or repaired the virtues that a maid were lost, narration that turned to speak America soon, the great novel to which it from the beginning did not need their own chroniclers that counted it and mentioned Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticism the excesses of the counted thing by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes that invented us to all (the writers) made ridicule of the false witnesses who appeared in histories presented like real, but otherwise never she would have been gotten to count the history of America with imagination to which it needed until the modesty."
Nevertheless, it emphasized "are the crazy people and the fakers those that better imagine" and is where it converges reality and lie, where no longer it knows that of the narrated thing it belongs to a side or another one, where the fiction Literature reaches its apogee.
The flame in fact the "tradition cervantina'.
"By inheritance hers we are what it is counted."
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero limited and applauded the variety of interpretations to that the finger in the sore gave rise the invitation of the FIL with its round table.
The cuban-Puerto Rican pointed his towards the great sore of the social violence that crosses its country - and shares Latin America product of the disputes of the traffic and drug sale.
"I believe that good Literature, the good poetry, the good songs lock up a tacit commitment that by all means is not premeditaded," it indicated, after mentioning that the reality of Literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that settles down between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this last one.
The night Luis Garcia Montero closed the Spanish poet whose intervention also made emphasis "of that finger in the sore of the writer it jeopardize of the writer."
It considered that in a world that lives to haste, also in the intellectual customs and control of you bring back to consciousness them that it results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small one not and behind each negation is a small one yes."
"For being owners of our thought and to be owners of the reality we must clarify: and to clarify often means to put the finger in the sore and to bother those people who are much more comfortable thinking about cartoon, black and white, settled down ideas and without shade and also bothering to the powers that prefer a world in black and white," said, inviting to recover the sense to write.
Roman goes by his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts on three defeats in the end, has had bumps in its race, but it has known to already reach in three occasions the decisive series.
The duel of Saints Laguna and Monterrey in the end, in addition two different styles marked by their technicians face, who find to each other with a resistance marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts on three defeats in the end, has had bumps in its race, but it has known to already reach in three occasions the decisive series, although until now it has gone away in target and it is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinean has ended up being consoled with the medal of the runner-up, it has remained an one step back of the winners and peculiarly with a same equipment he has played final consecutive.
The Santista strategist arrived at his first end like trainer in the Match Opening 2002, when he took the reins of the Morelia with which he fell by global of 4-2 before Toluca\; later, in Closing 2003 also he arrived at the decisive duel and also he lost it with global of 3-1 and indeed before Was bordered.
Already with Saints Lagoon, in the Match Bicentennial 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén returned to undergo a reverse, since its equipment finished tied 2-2 before the choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the turn of penalties it was put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal to the title for finally three players his failed from the 11 steps and underwent the somersault 4-3.
Rubén already lost two end with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, its rival in turn, therefore does not want to suffer the same fate, looks for to come off the curse and power to celebrate a title for the first time, although it affirms that for most important him it is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I do not want to break no statistic, this is by a club, a liking to which I am due and by consequence the title for my will come, but the previous thing is most important," commented the helmsman when was questioned it about the numbers that it has against playing final.
Very effective it has the previous end, of which, it assures, it has learned much, "only education that we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we cannot celebrate, we we are preparations in the ray, the players also, because the previous time, with two penitentiaries to throw already we were preparations to leave running and I believe that is an education, until the party is not finished we can celebrate."
Knowledge that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that do not trouble to him, because it trusts his players: "One never looks for to arrive at the turn of penitentiaries, one looks for to finish in regular time, but sometimes it does not have of another one and it is necessary to be preparations, in the previous match we were preparations, unfortunately did a bad play to us the destiny, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety to have the title in the hands, but it was to us, that left something us for this end that we hope does not arrive at that instance."
Roman must in his hands stop being a technical runner-up and to prove for the first time the glory that the titles give.

It will announce NASA finding of extraterrestrial life
The American space agency mentioned to the press to tomorrow present a finding that will cause impact in the search of living beings in the space.

When mentioning to the press, the NASA assured that it will present "a finding that will cause impact in the search of extraterrestrial life," which provoked speculations of experts of other countries.

Apparently one is a microbe that was found at heart of the Lake Monkey in the Park Nacional Yosemite, California, where it lives in an atmosphere that thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist in other planets, that do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiólogos, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "yes there is another form of life, one second form of life, different from which we know."
The space agency will present the true reach the findings in the press conference morning Thursday.
In the conference the geobióloga Pamela Conrad will participate, that studies the possibility of life in Mars\; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the greater Saturn moon), under the perspective of which its chemistry is similar to the one of the Earth.

There are other sites that also shine neglecting and incomplete, said, like the Shield and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Nowadays, so that the tourist comes does not only depend on the promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has cleaning in its beaches, in its avenues, permanent maintenance in which is attractive the tourist ones," it said.
"The attention due has not occurred and this type of facts puts in evidence something that is well-known by all, the maintenance it is necessary."
Raul Llera Martinez, undersecretary of Tourist Promotion, expressed that the rescue of tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not been useful correctly and they project a bad image.
It spoke of a series of places that are due to in line put altogether with the municipality and to be priority to have the city to the day, clean, ordinate and that is attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Luckyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will be to order first, to clean and to put to us in line to make them attractive to be able to add them in the inventory which we must to promote to the destiny."
It requests IP results to the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example to see by a better Sinaloa by the diverse challenges that faces.
A Legislature of worthy and free work in agreements between parties and the state Executive demands the enterprise sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problematic.
From legislature, integrated by seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Party New Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM was installed the 60 yesterday, that a total of 40 popular representatives adds.
Between the listing of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the S-state of which they come to realize a clean management and of commitment with the society and with the different sectors that they require of a responsible work legislative and which the same landlords of the partisanship or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Enterprise Coordinating Council, proposed that just worn for the first time 40 deputies of the Congress of the State they assume the great responsibility of being an example to see by a better Sinaloa by the diverse challenges that faces.
"We hoped that the deputies really exert their right, free in agreements between the parties because it is custom that make adjustments to guard by the self-interests and they become carnavaleras puppets of the governors and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
For that reason it spoke of which they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that they remove to the Governor in turn ahead.
"We occupied that they come to do a worthy work and mainly it jeopardize with the society and the sectors because they were the sinaloenses that gave the vote them of confidence in the past elections."
Jose Ramon Manguart Sanchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islas, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is the one to push and to add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated.
"Most important it is than they push the economic growth, that generates incentives for the investment and infrastructure and that somehow will foment the generation of uses."
As far as the tourist activity, it demanded that the new legislators give the weight him that has within the state budget to fortify the Secretary of state Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the second Secretariat in the state with estimated minor and is incongruous as important and generating economic activity of currencies and investment and which of direct form competes with the land trains."
Apart from which it is required to label resources to detonating tourist projects and that they help in giving security to the state and in the update to the Alcohol Law that has not been able to solve in previous legislatures.
A magical king looks for
Wrists, cars and bicycles, among others toys, are the yearning of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.

Fourteen presumed lengthy drug dealers
Wednesday, in Flutes, a ten of persecutions within the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis has been realized.
Fourteen people have been stopped who will face diverse accusations.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was realized.
"They have been seized around 750 plants of Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined to the production," it indicates Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Security of Quebec.
Altogether, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including both supposed leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The prisoners had to appear in the palace of justice of Sherbrooke in the hours following to their halting.
They could face the accusations of production of Cannabis, possession with the intention of dealing, conspiracy and robbery of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after one long investigation that has lasted near a year.
"The one has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to realize the haltings," it needs Mr. Ruel.
In this police operation they participated around seventy agents of the module of investigation of Flutes of the Security of the Quebec, the Service of police of Sherbrooke and of the Department of Memphrémagog police.
It will be able to be fought against the clandestine migration without problems
The project of law of the conservatives that, according to the Government, would have to solve the problem of the migrant patera loaded of clandestine, surely will face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced Wednesday that could not support it.
"I am based mainly on the Letter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that you are above," Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies declared the liberal leader after the celebration of the weekly meeting of caucus.
Liberal they defend that project of law in his form present, that would allow to stop until a year any person who comes from a ship identified like transport of clandestine immigrants, infringes the Canadian Letter of rights and liberties.
The leader of the Block of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not endorse the law project because aims at the mistaken target.
"We are against and, according to it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will already see what the Government does," Mr. Duceppe declared.
The critic of the NPD in the matter of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected with a stroke of the pen the critics that indicate that its party is not sufficiently firm with the clandestine immigrants.
"The neodemocrats agree in which they are adopted measures against the ones in charge of the patera of clandestine and that is what we try with another project of law, the C-35," indicates Mrs. Chow.
"We did not support the project of law of the conservatives because she attacks the refugees and she jails to the children during a minimum of a year," Mrs. Chow explains.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has blamed the parties of the position to play politicians and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The great majority of the Canadians says to the deputies whom do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and which they try to the country as if outside a mat."
"They hope that Canada adopts some measured firm," Minister Kenney thinks.
The Government has not announced a confidence voting on his project of law, which could take to the country to some elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has communicated the Agency QMI that the Government was going to ask for the celebration of a voting so that each deputy who is going to be against explains himself later before his voters.
The new unit does not secure the unamimity
Although the possible creation of a permanent unit of fight against the corruption and collusion by Jean Charest had announced, numerous observers continue requesting the establishment of a commission of public consultation on the question.
The Minister of the public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been considering for two days: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York is question from January of the past year.
The metropolis own a permanent unit against the corruption from 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of Tuesday has pillaged by surprise to more than one.
It is possible to say that, during a meeting of the permanent Council on the police services of Quebec celebrated the past 29 of October, never this measurement in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil struggled.
That was sufficient so that the critic of the Quebecker party that tackles the question about the public security, Stéphane Bergeron, would describe this announcement like "a rabbit removed from the top hat" and like "a slapdash solution of last hour."
The Minister Dutil, on the other hand, he has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the results when we announce it," it indicates simply.
"We are conscious of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, is nothing can replace the launching of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest is obstinate in avoiding the creation of this commission of investigation, the more people shares our opinion, that is to say, that has something to stash," he explains.
"The only way to have an investigation commission is with the resignation of Jean Charest," it explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the national School of public administration.
In order to leave this deadlock, it suggests to Quebec that grants a special mandate to the general inspector so that it realizes a survey on collusion and the corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general inspector," it concludes.
Also, it considers that Quebec could grant to the inspector the same competitions that to a commissioner, allowing him thus to force the people to testify.
The creation of one quadrilles permanent is not the only budding project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also solicits to Ottawa that modifies the penal Code so that it adapts better this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the public prosecutor of the Marteau operation, that has informed to the Minister of Jean-Marc Fournier Justice of which the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigations.
The federal Minister of the public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed on the other hand that its homologous one of Justice, Rob Nicholson, at the moment inclines to realize certain amendments in relation to this subject.
During the operation Primavera 2001 related to the groups of moteros, although the penal Code would not have adapted, were stopped 131 people.
Later, Ottawa impelled the adoption of the Law on the gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme monitoring
Diverse water obstacles are being watched close by due to the strong precipitations that have been registered in several regions of the province from Tuesday.
Wednesday in the evening a landslide in Shawinigan took place, in Mauricie.
Like preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière took place.
A highway sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday at night, diverse regions registered some strong precipitations, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, they are expected at night between 20 and 40 millimeters additional from now until Thursday, based on the region.
The sectors located to the north of the river and in the valley of the Outaouais were affected.
They could receive until a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the defrosting of the snow that already was had accumulated in certain sectors, it is afraid that diverse rivers are overflowed.
Wednesday at night, the unit of civil Security of Quebec emitted alert for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, already have brought about floods in the past and are under monitoring.
In the region of Lanaudière, the strong precipitations have caused that overflowed some Lagos in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-of-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, strong rains have dragged an emergency bridge.
Like prevention measurement, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the certain overflow of Lagos has caused the closing of several routes, in particular in the Mansfield-ET-Pontefract municipality.
The unit of civil Security follows in alert and watches the fence situation, according to has indicated Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Center of forecast of the swellings of Quebec, on the other hand, emitted Wednesday announcements communicating the strong swellings of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They blame partially to Dupont
The presenter of radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has undergone a certain reverse before the Canadian Council of the norms of the broadcast television (CCNR) by some controverted declarations in relation to the social attendance and on the Haitians, as well as by their crude language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his equipment of 98.1 CHOI FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain declarations contained "inexact information on the social attendance, an illegally negative representation of the Haitians and crude language that would not have to be used in the emissions spread during the day."
The Council has indicated also that the debates on the suicide, including the spreading of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe the codes on the broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to the commentaries made in emissions spread between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was emitted after a complaint of the common Front of people who receive social attendance of Quebec.
The group complained which the quantities mentioned in the emission were not correct.
The presenters must communicate trustworthy data and not that leads to deceit.
In relation to the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had showed that the suicide was a cowardice act.
The majority of the members of the Committee has reached the conclusion that the transmitted message was that the suicide like a solution to the problems of the life would not have to be considered.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes put in prohibition of "Dupont him midi" have dealed with a delicate subject an equitable and suitable way."
Therefore, in this respect any fault has been rejected.
The last litigation talked about to the declarations realised after the earthquake of Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had carried out a mediatic confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter declared that he had not realized any donation to help the Haitians because could not know surely if the needed ones were going to really receive the money.
The Committee considers that these commentaries are not abusive, but that its cumulative effect illegally constitutes a negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already fulfilled my suspension of three days there above."
"My file is clean for a year and a half," declared the presenter.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the emission of crude language.
In any case, the chain of radio CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more of the required thing."
The consequences will be minimum for the transmitter, that will have, among other things, to announce the decisions once in the hours of greater hearing within three days.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
Montrealés of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, who emphasizes in "sanda" (kung fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, raises tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts as the kung fu and kickboxing for 12 years, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, that lives in the metropolis from 2008 to advance in the professional level.
"In my case, I everywhere look for combats because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground which they imply the mixed martial arts, few competitions in North America exist."
The athlete, who works like agent of security and employee of the UPS company, has recently given to the bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals in the Championship of the World amateur of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), celebrated from the 23 to the 30 of October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have gained in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," it explained.
"At the moment I prepare myself to participate in the Glass of the World of san shou in China."
"They will invite the sportsmen who have finished between the four first positions in the last championship of the world in each category."
"In 2009, I gained the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finalized the match in fifth position, but I reached the third position in Toronto in 2009," it added.
"The interesting thing is that I have been progressing in each competition."
"To this step, I will be the first this time or next year"
"San shou" or "sanda" is an original discipline of China in which he allows himself to strike with the fists and the feet, as well as to send to the adversaries to the ground.
The confrontations originally are celebrated on a platform and, less frequently, in Ring.
The most famous boxer in this type battle is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Him, widely recognized in the world of the martial arts.
Although To be born Zemmal only must maintain a competition in its race, without a doubt of Sanda will go to the great match "King," the Super Bowl of the kung fu.
"This competition is most well-known and prestigious of China," explains the likeable boy.
"It is like the equivalent to the Lumpinee stage (the greater stage of Thailand) ."
"It has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won its first combat, in the semifinals of its category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
"The one that has won to me is a true professional," it thinks.
"There are four competitors by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face in the end of their category."
"Next, the champions of each category face to crown an only champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without licitations
Hydro-Quebec has granted direct contracts for 450 million dollars to companies of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In center of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a partnership formed by companies VPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, that the most important contract has obtained without a previous licitation, the one of management of the project, by a sum of 295 million.
The partnership, Énergie call gérance, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision of Hydro-Quebec to trust to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5,000 million dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie partnership gérance obtained the lucrative contract without previously one public licitation was realized.
For the Quebecker Party, the resource to partnerships of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens eliminating the competition and bringing about an ascent of the prices.
"One is a new method of collusion and to eliminate the competition."
"That is to say, people, instead of doing it privily, now do it openly," declared yesterday the deputy of the Quebecker Party Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
More early, in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question in the national Assembly because, according to he affirms, he does not understand how it is possible to be benefitted in this way to the public interest.
The Minister of natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the evening, denying firmly who has taken place a collusion with this contract.
"I begin to get tired," it protested, defending that the PQ had acted of "dishonest" way and "with lack strictly speaking."
It indicated that "the minimum" would be that the PQ apologized.
The formula of the partnerships is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, one is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or several companies to group his knowledge to respond to a licitation for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, considering the magnitude of works.
The works already have begun and will last until 2012.
In all the case, the contract has granted without the competition entered game\; one has been a negotiation.
In addition, the formula of the partnerships has stopped being the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Devoir published the week past Him, the formula of the partnerships in the sector of the technical advising is being put under an investigation in the Government.
A fast look to the mercantile registry of Quebec allows to identify more than 200 partnerships, of which some seem permanent.
In this way, the Dessau company works in association with the majority of its main competitors, like CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche ET Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and exists tens of them, leads an only legal person, that is to say, Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie partnership gérance, Minister Normandeau is outstanding that "the territory of the James Bay responds to a dynamics of particular manpower and Hydro-Quebec responds specifically to her from years 1970."
The great head of the project Eastmain, Real Laporte, of the Société d'énergie of Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that is outstanding the fact that the contract of management of the project has been granted of direct form.
"If you respond to a licitation and are few participants, your prices are going more to be lifted."
"You have two options: you can make contact with the actors of the sector and say to them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"Despite, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," indicated Mr. Laporte.
The contract granted to the Énergie partnership gérance comprises of one long contract list of more than 50,000 dollars obtained by the Quebecker Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Him Devoir has identified 109 contracts of technical advising granted between the year 2002 and March of 2010 to companies or to their branchs, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, 14 Tecsult and Dessau 10, without considering its participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
Altogether, they ascend to 449.783.344 dollars, including the contract of Énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has given to understand that the four companies that form the partnership (VPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) "good are known the liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau has left to fall that the PQ also is tie to these companies, that "fund it," before needing that is rather its leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption. "The green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebecker consumer as soon as he trusts the actors of the sustainable development, as well as in the brands of right commerce nor in ecological certificates to guide its elections.
According to the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is still worse. The consumer is submerged in a mediatic universe by where messages teem that defend a more responsible consumption, but lament the lack of trustworthy information and consider that this one even restrains its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the Quebecker ones seem to give very little credit on those who tries to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies nor the publicity ecological of the same, it reveals the tool of measurement elaborated by the Observatory of the consumption responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of the consumers puts in doubt the reliability of the official certificates that carry called products right, as well as the credibility of products and brands that takes labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsables," indicates the Barometer.
In the same way, only a 14.6% of the Quebecker ones are taken in serious the speeches from the political ones on this question.
In any case, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential at the moment to stimulate this sector of the consumption, sustained by near a third of the Quebecker consumers.
In fact, the lagoons and the doubtful character of the information cause that a 46% of the consumers reject this option.
One is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the lifted price more of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecker ones says to also distrust of the supposed yields of products or ecological services that are tried to them to sell.
On the other hand, practically half of the consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, they changed the brand of one or several products to respect his convictions.
A 61% have given priority to the purchases in the stores of their district and have preferred to buy worked nourishing products in their region, indicates the Barometer.
Greener and responsible (the index of the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec adores to occupy the position of the king of the recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of the fauna.
Nevertheless, according to the Barometer, that it brings back to consciousness social outside seems to be of doors (of its car): in 2010, only 28% of the Quebecker ones indicated that it has used the public transport or have shared car to defend its ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants of this ample survey of behavior, that finishes completing his first edition, on foot support the use of the bicycle and the displacements.
A loan so that the State recovers eXcentris
Government of Quebec, to that they have asked that eXcentris is committed financially in the recovery of the complex of pos cinemas the Société Angus and the Parallèle, accepts to collaborate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société of développement Angus and the Parallèle, that hoped a donation of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Culture to return to buy to Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris in the Saint-Laurent boulevard and to give back their true cinephile vocation to him, has not obtained what they asked.
The Government has accepted to imply himself in the subject, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the waited for donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose quantity would be, in fact, inferior to the initial expectations\; this one could constitute a viable solution in advantageous conditions, according to at least determined employees public.
Quebec already had rejected the past spring a first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the requests have been reviewed to the loss.
The president of the Société of développement DES entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran1cois Macerola, that leads the file of eXcentris, sent to a proposal and a plan of action to Minister St-Pierre.
It has sent a last report to him makes a ten of days.
However, the SODEC received a counterproposal of the cabinet Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus must of term until the 31 of December to respond the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation of the State must be rejected completely.
We remember that the proprietor Association of rooms of cinema and cinematographic complexes of Quebec was against to a direct investment of the State to endorse the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to fund real estate projects, since it has not done it with other rooms of cinema.
On the other hand, diverse representatives of the sector yes demand a considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has taken during ten years the load of the cinema of author in his premises of the complex, after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Council of the Treasure.
The lack of rooms for independent films is clear in Montreal and eXcentris had known fidelizar to its customer.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, impels on the other hand a deprived campaign of financing in, hoping to reunite 700,000 dollars to lay way towards the acquisition.
From spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues projecting films in eXcentris.
The objective of the buying futures is to reopen the three rooms next the 27 of February, being projected the precious film of Xavier Beauvois "DES hommes ET DES dieux."
Nevertheless, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to put himself in contact with Him Devoir and we do not know what he thinks and his group of the proposals to the loss that have received.
The veil of Canada with a complex rises...
The new American diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks keep awake what the United States considers like the complex of the Canadians with respect to the Americans, but simultaneously reflect the feeling of superiority of these last ones towards Canada.
The American diplomats are surprised of which the Canadian voters do not think about United the Canada-State relations when they are going to vote and they think that the visit of president Obama has helped to the conservative government to obtain that its budget in 2009 was approved!
The four new communications between the American embassy of Ottawa and the Washingtons that have become public yesterday, rather offer substantial details that contained really substantial.
A cable of the 22 of September of 2008, that is to say, during total federal electoral campaign, relates to what extent the United States does not enter the questions debated by the political leaders.
This brought about great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders are themselves conditional by a practically inherent inferiority complex the Canadians at the time of tackling the daily domestic questions, instead of leaving such election to the United States (like during the campaign on the 1988 free trade) ," he writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak of him."
The ambassador has problems in understanding this "deafening silence still more" because both countries maintain some intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, it thinks, the capacity of a candidate, a party and, still more, of the head of a party to manage these essential relations it would have to be a key factor about which the voters at the time of voting would have to think."
This feeling of importance can be observed also the sent cable the 22 of January of 2009 by Terry Is annoyed, in charge of businesses in Ottawa, to prepare to president Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Its trip will contribute to guarantee the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by means of which Canada will register for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a plan of recovery among 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars," the gentleman writes Annoys himself.
In no side mention of which becomes the government had to prorogue the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that he replaced to him the coalition nor that the opposition parties conditioned his survival to the quality of the proposed plan of recovery.
Another communication of January of 2008 signed by ambassador alert Wilkins to the Washingtons on the more and more negative image that transmit the spread dramatic series in the CBC of the United States.
To the ambassador the emission worries to him about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings are realized little so that the company it realizes energetic interrogations.
Another cable tells that, during its first bilateral encounter, Hillary Clinton asked its homologous French Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be prepared to welcome in some prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner responded that yes, but who depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has given a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary accepted to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits in relation to the WikiLeaks site have been warmed up.
Tom Flanagan, old adviser very near Stephen Harper, declared in the CBC radio that the person in charge of this massive flight would have "to be assassinated."
In the United States they become echo of Mike Huckabee.
A world-wide plan to renew the illumination
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan of renovation of the domestic, commercial and industrial illumination in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in an amount that practically corresponds to a third of the additional diminution that must be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is framed in the set of great projects concrete that the UN hopes that it is adopted in Cancún to compensate the lack of binding commitments of reduction in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs, that still monopolize between the 50 and 70% of the market, would replace by light bulbs fluocompactas or, still more good, by light bulbs of light-emittent diodes (OF or "the LED" in English), great part of the 1,800 million tons (Gt) of GEI emitted in the planet would be avoided to illuminate the humans.
The illumination is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary automobile park.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the great emitting countries, like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed with some voluntary plans of reduction that had to diminish the global emissions of 53 GEI of 49 Gt to Gt.
Nevertheless, 5 would have to be diminished still Gt of this amount to stabilize, before 2020, the increase of the temperatures in two degrees Celsius to avoid that it is uncontrolled.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipate in the form of heat and the rest, that is to say, a 5%, produces light.
In the case of the light bulbs fluocompactas, the cost of energy is reduced in a 75% and with new light bulbs LED, it is still reduced twice plus the power consumption.
The light bulbs fluocompactas last an average among 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new light bulbs LED, like which manufacturer has sent Philips this week (a company that, in addition, has participated in the study of the UN), own a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume a 80% less than energy than an incandescent light bulb, which allows us to do an idea to us of the saving that can be obtained with the substitution plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new light bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Superficially, they do not contain anything of mercury.
Diverse specialists have indicated their reserves in relation to the light bulbs fluocompactas, since they contain mercury and that they must eliminate itself like dangerous residues, which not always is possible in the developing countries, unless the manufacturers place instructions.
Nevertheless, it indicates the report, the main source of mercury emission in the planet are not the light bulbs fluocompactas, but the coal thermal power plants, that emit a great amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with the incandescent light bulbs.
Only in the United States, these power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury to the year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would in this way save billion of dollars to the year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is to say, the equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million to him.
The Ivory Coast anxiously waits for the announcement of the election results
The Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has asked for "the immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast, since the determined terms have expired.
"The Secretary General emphasizes the necessity that the independent electoral commission completes its work and announces the provisional results immediately," emphasizes a spokesman of the head of the UN.
"It asks to all the parties of the Ivory Coast and to the institutions that demonstrate their sense of the responsibility and abstains from any initiative until the provisional results announce."
In spite of the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left passes the date limit of Wednesday to midnight without the results were published, three days from the scrutiny of Sunday.
Around forty minutes before the conclusion of the term, the president of the CIS had commented to the television that the commission "continued working" to announce the results.
Wednesday the requests have multiplied in the world of which the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second return between the Laurent Gbagbo projection and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
Nevertheless, the side of Gbagbo counts on the cancellation on the part of the constitutional Council of "the fraudulent" votes in the north, into the hands of the old rebellion of the new Forces (FN) from the blow of Failed state of September of 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of the Ivory Coast, has affirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of the voters realised by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the followers of the outgoing president to go to vote.
All the election could be annulled if the constitutional Council accepts the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, the adversaries of Gbagbo consider that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a near political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north that denies any relation to the old rebels, has judged of "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and has asked to Gbagbo that respects them, but has not gone as far as to vindicate the victory.
Their allies affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that there is lost and that to make a complaint before the constitutional Council after to have prevented who the electoral commission the diffusion of the results, would be illegal.
The second return of the presidential ones, Sunday, must have put the sour cherry to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations have noticed Wednesday to the political class of the Ivory Coast that could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first return, the 31 of October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, that publicly received the support of old president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first return).

Alexandre investigated and stopped Guérini
Alexandre Guérini, of 53 years, manager of companies of treatment of residues and brother of president PS of the general Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been jailed in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, within the framework of an investigation on contracts supposedly fraudulent public.

"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and will respond to all the questions that to him the magistrate poses, nonghost."
"It is easy to persecute to him by a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to demonstrate them," had declared to AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, before the appearance of her client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain itself.
Wednesday at night began to investigate and jailed also to one of their near people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, only who has done his client has been to take care of the garbage dumps that must manage.
As far as the allocation of contracts or to the destiny of the bottoms related to its execution, nothing knows on the matter, according to says the lawyer Simon.
Within the framework of this file, it is being investigated also from Wednesday Daniel Pinna, ex- general director of the services of the urban sprawl of Aubagne, by embezzlement and complicity, but they have left him in parole and has prohibited to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that they have reproached to him."

Michel Karabadjakian, attached general director of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused by "abuse of power and passive corruption."
Two civil servants of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated by "subtraction and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and by "complicity in the embezzlement public," respectively.

Between the people who have faced Mr. Guérini appears Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, jailed recently in a parallel case of contracts fraudulent public who affected to Corsica.
The investigators suspect that their societies are service to whiten the capital of the great bandidismo.
The investigation is being realized within the framework of several initiated judicial instructions against X in April of 2009 after the reception of some anonymous communications, by all means fraud in the contract allocation public, in particular in the sector of the residues.
A source near the investigation indicates that the investigations especially concentrate in the conditions of allocation and operation of a garbage dump in the Ciotat, that picks up the remainders of Aubagne, as well as of other cities of the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: the Elysian one is exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July of 2009 and May of 2010, the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, the young stopped French investigator in Iran by "espionage," it has had on tenterhooks to the public in France, it has alerted to the diplomacy and it has accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the looked letter of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian one has explained its strategy to the Americans until the point to give advice them to manage its own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French people in charge tried to convince to Washington that the liberation of the young French did not take place in interchange by the liberation of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian stopped in France and looked for by American justice by traffics of materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate to mass media to give the idea that the Syria president, Bachar Al-Assad, it had performed an essential function in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it did not do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written up the 12 of August of 2009 in Paris takes the title "Iran: French commentaries on the way to manage the cases of taking of hostages."
The adviser of Elysian for strategic subjects, Fran1cois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for Middle East and North Africa, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise to the Americans who make the following thing to repatriate to their own citizens retained to the force in Iran.
"You make noise," they say, "you continuously loosen" in mass media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
Everything to shame the Iranian, careful regime of its image.
"When the Iranians ask to you that you stop, do it more frequently still."
Because, once exhausted the attempts of negotiation by discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "expert in delaying maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the halting of foreigners is "habitual Iranian tactics: the taking of hostages for the political blackmail."
It announces that the liberation of prison of Clotilde Reiss (that will take place the 16 of August, day in that will take refuge in the embassy of France) "will require the installment to the Iranians of a great amount of money" (230,000 Euros of reward).
In addition, it indicates that the Elysian one anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "is going to increase."
The Iranians could "in the future next stop to another one of near 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," affirm.
28 of August of 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but it is blocked in Iran.
The following information spreads: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition asks for the United States by illicit traffic of delicate electronic equipment towards Iran, has been set free in Paris on the decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, that close the Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of a prisoner of Majid Khakavand constitutes the bad news.
Accepted has France an interchange?
To release to the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, the 4 of September, Fran1cois Richier guarantees that it was not thus.
The Elysian one, affirms, not only "it has been surprised enormously by the decision of the judge," but it has tried to be against to the same.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the judicial decision," comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand follows under "narrow" the monitoring of the French information services.
The adviser of the Elysian one dials a telephone number, hangs and, later, he informs to the American diplomat of which the Iranian "at the moment is in some buildings of Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the halting of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysian one does not scrimp in efforts, uses official notices and "organized flights" in mass media to make think that Syria president Bachar Al-Assad plays an important" and "influential" role "of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity with certain irony and verify that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several articles of press transmit the French official version.
A telegram on the 25 of August of 2009 mentions ""blitz" mediatic of the French civil servants."
To what such "gratitude" is due towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks itself.
"In spite of their declarations full of praises, the French civil servants recognize in private whom they only have an idea wanders than the Syrians have done really."
Next, the document treats the reasons that have taken the Elysian one to give foot to this fiction.
The concerted effort of communication "intends to validate the policy of Sarkozy of opening towards Syria," it thinks.
A policy initiated in 2008, that "according to numerous voices critics in France and abroad, finished being erased of premature and being been inferior."
When "exaggerating the Syria paper," Paris tries "to show Syria the praises that can harvest if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The objective also consists of "seeding the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it of good source.
The 11 of August, Fran1cois Richier trusts to him: "by all means, we do not know if the Syrians have done something or no."
"But anyway, we have thanked for it."
"At least, this would have to bring about confusion between the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France the 16 of May of 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysian one.
In an official notice, it thanks for the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio that have played a "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
As of midnight, the Korean young people cannot play in line
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called "of Ashen" that will prevent the adolescents to in line participate in games after the average night blocking its access, according to have indicated responsible governmental.
In December a project of law will be put under the Parliament to ask in line to the companies of games that less than block the access to these games after midnight to the young people of 16 years, according to they have indicated representing of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and, later, he is to them difficult to study in the school and to take a normal life during the day."
"We thought that this law is necessary to protect its health and its right to the dream," it declared AFP Jo Rhine, ministerial person in charge in charge of the law project.
The games in line will be again available to six in the morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare themselves to the application of the law, needs.
The government also considers to ask to the companies that limit the daily access time these games when the parents of the young people therefore ask for it, added the person in charge.
In addition, it is going to put at the disposal of who asks for it gratuitous software that allows to limit the connect time Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries "connected more" and the newspapers regularly notify on diverse tie facts to an intensive use of Internet.
The country is also the unquestionable champion of the world-wide competitions of games in line.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where it faced other 58 countries.
World-wide 2018-2022: the FIFA designates to the organizing countries
In the middle of the storm brought about by the corruption suspicions, the executive committee of the FIFA designates Thursday to the organizing countries of the Glasses of the world of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political election where the fights of influence and lobbying can get to prevail on the technical criteria.
A thing is clear, the edition of 2018 of the competition of the FIFA will be celebrated in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Low-Belgium Countries).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the Federation the International hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after an opening in the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its implantation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that comprised of the delegations (David Cameron, prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Sócrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of Government Dutch Belgian and, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic and political interests that are in game in a World-wide one.
The transactions between frames, therefore, are possible that they last until the last minute.
By the others, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the report of evaluation of the FIFA, the candidacies English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) own better arguments than their competitors.
Nevertheless, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, person in charge of the revelations that lead to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined therefore the opportunities of its country, cradles of the soccer, that only welcomed the World-wide one once, in 1966.
BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION added to firewood to the bonfire Monday when spreading a documentary one that it has put in evidence to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicholas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient to upset to the FIFA and to shame the English people in charge, who have sent themselves to lobbying intense in the last weeks with David Cameron at the top.
The Head of Government hopes to reedit the blow given successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had obtained in the 2005 for London organization of the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, it will be sufficient to recover the brightness of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal pair also counts on numerous strength thanks to its stages, already ready, their experience (World-wide of the 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Glass of Europe in 2004 in Portugal) and its soccer culture.
Nevertheless, the shady economic outlooks and financiers of both countries could throw their ambitions down.
The possible retaliation against English and the doubts on the solution of Spain and Portugal the only thing that obtain is to give points to Russia, turned into an outsider of weight in spite of the lagoons in its candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
Nevertheless, Prime minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the voting," in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They are removing to shine its dirty rags, trying to jeopardize," affirmed to them Putin.
For 2022, the United States, that has the 1994 experience, seems the most logical favorites.
First main world-wide economic power and headquarters of the sponsors of the FIFA, the country it seems to take advantage to him to Japan and South Korea, that have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that have organized together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the concession from World-wide the 2026 to China, fervent wished by the FIFA, that it would cause that Asia remained without possibilities for 2022.
Next to Qatar, that its project has presented being based on futurist stages, and Australia, the FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also turns harmed by the weakness of the paid rights of TV (based on the hour difference) by the European countries, the spine of the war for the FIFA.
Secondly mandate: the test
De Gaulle really had doubted.
Mitterrand had given to understand that it doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have nor the smaller doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
A mandate in the Elysian one takes to another one.
Therefore, the present Chief of State will return to be candidate in 2012.
However, the proofs of it does not combine well with the mystery that usually is associated to the presidential function.
Therefore, always it is necessary to pretend that doubt.
Towards a side and the other.
In 2006, although they would not believe it, the friendly of Jacques Chirac affirmed that it did not discard a third mandate.
The 15 of November, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would at some time make his decision "in autumn from 2011."
Therefore, the fact that it deals with the deputies of the UMP, Tuesday at night in the Elysian one, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused certain commotion.
One is the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited two the number of mandates of five years.
Simply it transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that speaks of the presidential ones, with a humorous tone, in encounter of this type.
"In worse, or the best one, of the cases, still you will pass seven year and a half with me," it had loosen in 2009 July.
In another occasion, May of 2010: "You do not think that I do not consider what will come later."
Their affirmations of the day before yesterday do not approach more to him the candidacy, neither either the less.
They provoke commentaries for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race by the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has raised the arena which takes to Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerar itself.
Rather on the contrary\; the fact that its candidacy in 2012 is evident is what takes to many people of the PS to protest that the battle is organized before the predicted thing.
On the other hand, the bad soundings.
For the first time, the right voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to the one of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," have reacted immediately and prudently the surroundings of Prime minister.
"If it thinks that it can lose, he will not be candidate," thinks Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think that he can win," Alain Juppé corrects, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: the BCE is forced to maintain its acquisitions of Letters of the State
The last meeting of the Council of governors of the European Central bank (BCE) of the year would have to allow to need the modalities exit of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a great number of nonconventional operations of monetary policy that would have to finalize at the end of year.
Because of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the institute of emission of Frankfurt without a doubt will not be able to be allowed to be so fixed if it does not want to risk to aggravate a situation than complicated today in the European markets of obligations.
The political cost would be equal of high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finances, Christine Lagarde, has endorsed the active role played by the BCE in favor of the solution of the crisis of the debt of the European States.
It has not meant if it considered that the central bank would have to do more, increasing for example his program of purchase of state obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my European companions...."
The eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Commission of Monetary Economic affairs and of the European Parliament, the president of the BCE, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not only more eloquent as far as his intentions, indicating that the program of purchase of Letters of the State in the secondary market "continued" and that "already we will see what we decided" during the meeting of Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the BCE is going to maintain its main invariable type in 1%, the level more under its history from May of 2009.
Actually, the acquisition of obligations of the Treasure on the part of the BCE has duplicated the week last until reaching near 1,350 million Euros.
In addition, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, it would have bought again Irish and Portuguese titles yesterday.
Altogether, the central banks of eurosistema have acquired titles by a quantity of 67,000 million Euros from May of 2010.
Between the operators of the market, it is not doubted minimum than they will follow the purchases (it consults page 29).
The economists do not anticipate any changes significant of course either.
Although the operations of loans to more than three months already have disappeared of the arsenal of the BCE, this one still realizes limitless allocations of liquidity to beneficial conditions and with durations that vary between one week and three months.
The economists hope that today this device extends during some months.
"I do not imagine that it is going to modify considerably its program."
"If no, the risk runs of bringing about new short term tensions," thinks Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more probable that an announced progressive exit during the first trimester of 2011 takes place," anticipates by its side Norbert Bräms, Salt economist.
Oppenheim.
In relation to the interventions in the market of the national debt, "the BCE would have to maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations so that the market stays stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Considering the importance of the exhibitions of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the zone of the Euro, the emission institute does not have more option than to maintain its presence in the market.
"He must compensate whatever the cost the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that he prevents a marked ascent of the yields paid by the most fragile States," an important manager of obligations thought yesterday.
Because, if interest rates put themselves by clouds, the States will have problems still more to reduce their indebtedness, or to even stabilize it.
This it is the price to protect to the Euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi heaves the weather
After Italy has begun the week of a disquieting way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb tide of the types of the obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
When coming out of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have affirmed that they listened Giulio Tremonti to describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an unforseeable" weekend was expected ," declarations denied later by the interested one.
In any case, Tuesday the difference with the types in the long term German had reached the number record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts of cover against the bankruptcy risk (CRQ) had gone off until the 263 points, causing a certain commotion in Rome.
In the Cabinet, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the types German was superior to 400 basic points.
But its right arm, Gianni Letta, were pronounced deeply "worried" about "the turbulences in the markets" and about a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the zone of the Euro, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," it explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the income associated to the same, which causes that the State runs the risk of not being able to do against its needs of financing.
The last forecasts of Brussels have supposed a cold water jug for the government.
One calculates that the Italian growth will respectively reach the 1.1% in 2011 and the 1.4% in 2012, whereas the budget that is being examined in the Senate is based on some numbers of 1.3% and 2%.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will next year represent 4.3% of the GDP (against 3.9% anticipated by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Of there the rumor that new budgetary dispositions can be applied after the celebrations, by a quantity of 7,000 million Euros.
"In necessary case, new measures of austerity will have to be adopted," thinks the Commissioner of Economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy counts on the support of the international institutions.
"The bases of their economy are in sequence and their accounts in good state, as we took for a long time saying," assure Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at heart the Monetary International responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither to short nor in the long term, because in spite of their considerable debt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011, EDITORIAL NOTE), the asked for efforts of stabilization to Italy are minors who the required ones to other countries," it comments Pier Carlo Padoan, economist head of the OECD.
It is the problem of the political instability.
The 14 of December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the House of Representatives, after who the elections at the end of March could be anticipated.
In such case, a propitious period to the decision making in case of a serious crisis would be opened little.
The European reflect on the reinforcement of the mechanisms of fight against the crisis
Christine Lagarde already has repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that already we have demonstrated Sunday, at night and for the day, that the European are clearly shared in common, decided, it jeopardize with the defense of their currency and its monetary zone."
Although he was relative, the relaxation registered yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States has impelled to the governments and the BCE.
Nevertheless, we cannot still speak of a normalization principle.
The agency of qualification Standard &amp\; Poor's announced that it could lower the qualification of the debt of Portugal, the most frequent target at present of the speculations.
"Like in May, lack really political clarity and transparency, which weight significantly on the banking systems," think the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political rate is much more slow that the rate of the markets."
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers that stash, the European countries intensify the debates to reinforce the mechanisms of exit of the already existing crisis.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of Finances that are seen more directly affected and, generally, with their homologous ones of the G-20 go by good way.
And this considering also the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin earlier this week that comes.
The BCE meets today.
In the daily routine, the type of nonconventional measures from support to the countries of the zone of the Euro in the collimator of markets (he consults more above).
As far as the European Bottom of Estabilidad Financiera (FEEF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, has initiated Tuesday in Singapore a route by Asia to inform to the investors of the Far East on the new features of the crisis in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits does not consist of collecting bottoms, without a doubt it prepares the land.
It is anticipated that the first emissions of titles of the FEEF are realized the next month.
Yesterday, a American official representative is trusting Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase of the bottoms mobilized by means of an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
As far as the countries that are in forward edge, Portugal and Spain, these to prepare itself to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organization of the labor market.
These reforms are added to the measures of austerity with a nearer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to advance by a way different from which followed Greece and Ireland.
Both want at all costs to avoid to ask for international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and to decide the structural reforms that they consider indispensable to increase the confidence of lasting form.
The capitalist partners of the European bottoms, finally, consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the markets of public obligations.
Of passage by Paris, the 24 of November, Axel Weber were first in sending the idea that, if the 750,000 million Euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not doubt in returning to remove the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of forward edge in the market of the European national debt, consider that a quantity of around 100,000 million additional Euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The instrument for it exists: the European mechanism of financial stabilization, equipped at present with 60,000 million Euros.
An advice that, without a doubt, could examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if they make worse the conditions of market.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in alert orange
The snowed ones continue bringing about circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect to diverse economic activities.
At the moment, twenty-four departments are in alert orange due to the risk of snowed and icing-up.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have added the twenty departments that already were combat ready orange, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, were united at night to the group.
According to Météo France, the snow-covered forts falls affect to the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also it snows slightly in Island of France.
Some are expected snow layers among 2 and 5 cm, precise among 7 and 10 cm, in the departments affected, and among 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, d'Armor Côtes, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Normandy Loss, Island of France and Lemosín.
The snowed ones are sufficiently strong like bringing about circulation difficulties and to affect to some economic activities, alerts Météo France.
In the d'Armor Côtes, the access to several departmental highways to the heavy vehicles of more has been prohibited than 7.5 tons, including the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, reason why they recommend that it is not conducted safe in case of necessity and the circulation of certain vehicles TER has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transport in Picardy has been prohibited.
Wednesday had not been anticipated any specific measurement at night to limit the circulation of the heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges to all the conductors to that they lead with the greater prudence in the highways and to that adapt his conduction to the situation."
The Main directorate of civil aviation (DGAC) asked to the airlines that annulled to Thursday 25% of their flights in the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly because of the anticipated snowed ones.
The DGAC recommends the aerial passengers who make contact with their airline.
In Great Britain, the airport of Gatwick, to the south of London, and the one of Edinburgh, in Scotland, is closed until Thursday in the morning.
Meter of the Grand Paris: financial first drafts
Ever since the debate on the modernization of the transport in the Island of France has reached its algid point, thousands of million rain.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we spoke of 23,000 million for the meter of the Grand Paris that must construct to the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate this SGP, the State it has announced an allocation of bottoms of 4,000 million Euros.
In the theoretical plane, this sum will be the one that will later allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to fund a part of its double curl.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The rectifying law of 2010 finances, examined in the commission of finances of the National Assembly this morning, contains the anticipated devices to find the first part of that money.
Two ways exist: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase of the tax on the offices in the Island of France.
First, according to we read in article 15 of the text of the law project, is "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
In addition, it is fixed to numbers: "The product of this tax is of 117 million Euros to the year."
Second it is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernize it, to increase its product and to destine this increase in the Société du Grand Paris."
How much it would be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
In the text numbers do not occur.
But it is far from 4,000 million.
"One needs that the fiscal resources add to the 4,000 million Euros of the allocation of bottoms that will mobilize the State and that will grant to the Société du Grand Paris as it advances the project," we can read in the exhibition of reasons.
The SGP it does not surprise this system to him.
"As of the moment in which income are created (both imposed, editorial note), we can cover the studies during three years and later to receive 4,000 million later, according to we explained."
"It will be registered in the budget and it will be used based on the needs."
The SGP calculates that it will empecerá to receive 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which 4,000 engaged million do not appear in the credit, can bring about a parliamentary debate slightly ignited.
The first public session will be the 7 of December.
Diligent avenging and spy hackers
The WikiLeaks subject has a double value.
On the one hand, an apparent scandal keeps awake, a scandal that only seems scandal before the hypocrisy that governs the relations between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep international scale changes and anticipates a future dominated by the regression.
But we go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation the fact that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to that it belongs) it is formed exclusively by cuts of press.
"Extraordinary" the American revelations on the sexual customs of Berlusconi only reflect what it has been written for months in any newspaper (except which they belong to Berlusconi) and the sinister mocking profile of Khadafi takes to long time giving ideas to the artists of night club to create its sketches.
The norm according to which the secret files only must be formed by the news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If it visits a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, it will see that each work repeats exactly (on the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-him-Château, the Templarios or the Rosacruz) what it had been written in previous works.
This not is only due to that the occultist text authors do not want to make unpublished investigations (or she does not know where to look for new features on the nonexistent thing), but because who dedicate themselves to the occultism not only trust which or they know, which reconfirms what or they had learned.
This one is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same is applied to the secret files.
The informer is sluggish, like he is sluggish (or he has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I what I know, editor of the Libération), that only considers certain what can recognize.
The information top secret on Berlusconi who sent the American embassy from Rome to the Department of S-state the same that published the Newsweek the previous week.
Then, why they have caused to such commotion the revelations of these files?
On the one hand, only they say what all worked person or knows, that is to say, that the embassies, at least from World War II and since the Chiefs of State can be called by telephone or take the airplane to meet to have dinner, there are lost its diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, they have been transformed into espionage centers.
Any spectator who sees investigation films knows perfectly, we only pretended that we do not know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact to repeat publicly infringes it to have of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker anyone can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world affects considerably to the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects so much to the victims as to the "twigs."
But we enter the true nature than it has happened.
Formerly, at the time of Orwell, it could be conceived to all power like a Big Brother who controlled each gesture of its subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has become reality since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, each realised transaction, visited hotel, taken freeway, the citizen in this way became one complete victim of the eye of the power.
But when one demonstrates, as happens now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of the power can escape to the control of a hacker, the control relation stops being unidirectional and it becomes to circulate.
The power controls each citizen, but each citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets the power.
How hold can a power that no longer can nor conserve its own secrets?
It is certain, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is secret empty (and a secret emptiness never could be kept awake) \; also it is certain that all knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact a secret emptiness, without secret, since it comes from the public scope\; but to keep awake, like has made WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were secret emptinesses means to clear all power to him.
WikiLeaks has not made him damage some to Sarkozy or Merkel, but, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
Which will be the consequences of this wound caused to a so powerful power?
It is evident that, in the future, the States no longer will be able to put in the network no reserved information, since would be like publishing it in a poster in the middle of the street.
But also it is evident that, with the present technologies, it is not possible to be hoped to maintain confidential conversations by telephone.
Nothing is easier that to discover if and when a Chief of State has himself displaced in airplane and she has made contact with one of the homologous ones.
How they will be able to maintain the future in private and confidential relations?
I know that, at the moment, my forecast is science thing fiction and, therefore, perfectly fictional, but I imagine to governmental agents that they move of discreet form in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, taking messages that have been learned of memory or, at the most, stashing some data written in the heels of his shoes.
That information is conserved then, in an only copy, drawers closed with key: after all, the attempt of espionage of the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that the technology at the moment advances like a crab, that is to say, backwards.
A century after the telegraph without cables has revolutionized the communications, Internet has returned to create a telegraph with cables (telephone).
The video tapes (analogical) had allowed the investigators of the cinema to study a film step by step, advancing and backing down, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, whereas now the CD (digital) only allows to advance or to back down of chapter in chapter, that is to say, to enormous proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas in airplane, with the displacements that entail, we needed three hour and a half.
Therefore, he is not nothing outside the normal thing that the policy and the techniques of communication take again to carriages.
A last commentary.
Formerly, the press tried to understand what it was plotted privily in the embassies.
At present, those are the embassies that request confidential information to the press.
Climate: the shoddy work of France in its promises of financing
A year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, is hour to examine if the quickly unblocked promises of financing have been respected (called fast start or precocious) realised by the developed countries.
And the French shoddy work has kept awake.
In the Agreement of Copenhagen, the developed countries were committed to provide 30,000 million dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union was committed to contribute to 7,200 million Euros in three years and France 1,260 million Euros (that is to say, 420 million to the year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU it has put on the table its better letters to convince its partners that its commitment with the financings fast start is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the pamphlet distribution...
The operation transparency appreciable result and was appreciated reason why really it is worth: the developing countries and the civil society would want that all the developed countries did the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 2,200 million Euros, which locates it in the good way towards the fulfillment of its commitment of 7,200 million in 2012.
But, if we studied the situation in detail, the things are more complicated.
According to the Agreement of Copenhagen, the money must be "new and additional" to guarantee that a complementary effort is realized, without harming to the official aid to the development.
Unfortunately, one has not reached an agreement exceeds what means "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed a harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that agrees to him more.
For example, the European Commission has taken like reference year 2009: the international financing stays and they add to 150 million in three years for financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references with regard to the year or at the level of the official aid to the development.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all the new projects" of year 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, reference to the expenses of the years previous nor to the total level of the official aid to the development does not become.
In particular, the total quantity of the aid from France to the developing countries can remain stable (or to even fall), while it tries that it respects his commitment in the matter of "new and additional" bottoms...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, any norm does not exist and everyone chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each lent Euro is equivalent to a donated Euro.
Evidently, such thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be just for certain investments that are profitable (frequently, projects related to the reduction of emissions that is based on more effective technologies), turns out deceptive to present a Euro that is going away to recover like equivalent to a Euro that is donated... At the most, the cost of the loan for the country would only be due to compute for its commitments that grants the loan (that is to say, the equivalent to an interest rate).
But France does not find useful such reasoning: "it respects" his commitment of 420 million Euros doing a 91.5% of loans (389.8 million Euros) and a 8.5% of donations (36.1 million Euros) \; it consults the document of the EU to see it by his own eyes.
One is the only country of the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in a 46%, whereas Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with a 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a Euro to fulfill its commitment, France contributes ten hundredth and only considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its financing fast start, France realizes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in the time and, on the other, in relation to the true financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million Euros, it is able to give the impression that it spends 420 "new and additional" million, as had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finances (because it seems that it is Bercy that has taken care of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, as much within the EU (why the other Member States were going to continue donating when they can simply render) like in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not idiot...
The chapter of the precocious financing is one minucia, relatively in the short term, in relation to the set of the negotiations on the climate.
But it could be a sand grain of more in the immense machinery that is the CMNUCC.
We hope that it is not thus.
It is what will be, turns out indispensable to learn of this first year of precocious financings.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect its commitments in the same way and that the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could cause that they advanced the debates on the bets in game in relation to the long term financing (another essential chapter that is struggling at the moment): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" nor of the method to compute the loans.
France could change its position to become so progressive in relation to this question as it is it with others.
Therefore, we have left the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancún the week that comes.
An announcement surprise on fast start of France and their vision of the "additional character" and the use of the loans would contribute to improve the level of international confidence necessary to advance in the negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by the children
A boy of 10 years ingests in a day 81 different chemical substances, according to he indicates a published study Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement by the rights and the respect of the future generations).
Association, that it notices that their results "do not have significant a statistic considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but illustrative of the problematic one are tried," it acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that usually consume a boy of about ten years in four meals and a snack to the day.
These meals taken like model, that respect the official recommendations (five parts of fruits and fresh vegetables, three of milky products and 1.5 liters of water to the day), as well as the treats, were examined in the laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified like cancerigenic possible or probable and five substances classified like cancerigenic insurances, as well as 37 substances susceptible to act like endocrine disturbers (PE), according to the studies of diverse institutions like the international Center of investigation on the cancer.
"Although, in practically the totality of the cases, the legal limits for each one of the chemical substances of individual form are not surpassed clearly, our study sample that the exhibition of the consumers to possibly cancerigenic polluting agents and/or EP is worrisome," it indicates the association.
For the breakfast, butter and the tea with milk contain in case single more than a ten of considered possible cancerigenic residues and three like cancerigenic insurances, as well as near a twenty of residues that can harm to the hormonal system.
The apple, concerned of Brazil, anticipated like snack for the school, contains plans of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same is applied to green beans of Kenya, including in the food, in which the study has detected plans of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the Russian fillet, the tin tuna and the bar of bread or chewing-gum were even decorated with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the faucet, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In dinner, the salmon slice was more "nutritious" with 34 detected chemical wastes and the analysis of the used plastic plate to even warm up the food in the microwaves was not completely clean.
The final risk that probably generates these "cocktails of polluting agents" for the consumer "is underestimated," says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Them Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to restrain "the increase of the diseases associated in the civilization."
In July, a study of the European Agency of Food safety (AESA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the consumed fruit and the vegetable in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
