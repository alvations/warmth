A Republican strategy in order to counter the re - election of President Obama
The leaders of the Republican justify its policy with the need to combat fraud.
But the Brennan Centre, the latter is a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud in the United States is far less than the number of people killed by the -.
The lawyers have the Republicans in 10 years in the USA is only 300 cases of fraud.
One fact is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the level of participation.
In this sense, these measures are undermining the democratic system in the United States.
In contrast with Canada are the states for the conduct of the elections in the individual States.
In this sense, has announced new laws, the majority of the American governments since 2009, the more difficult the procedure for the registration or the elections.
This phenomenon has gained after the elections in November 2010, 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were able to be recorded.
Consequently, 180 draft laws have been introduced in the year 2011, the constraints on the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new laws are demanding that the voters present a Lichtbildausweis citizenship and a proven US-Staatsb.
I also by this legislation will also reduce the time periods for the early vote declared invalid, the right to register on election day itself as voters and citizens, denied the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte.
Before the elections in 2006 has no US-Staat from the electorate to show that a Lichtbildausweis.
Indiana was the first federal state, who has made this request.
The Supreme Court of the United States, in 2008 the constitutionality of the law by Indiana.
The Republican authorities are hurrying to extend it to other countries.
In the course of the last two years in 34 bred legislation states with which the electorate, to show a Lichtbildausweis.
It is important to note that, in contrast to the US citizens Quebec not on a universal cards as the health card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens have, i.e. 21 million Dutch people, not of a governmental authority of their state Lichtbildausweis issued.
I also five million Neuwähler in 2012, we do not have such a card.
But often to pay more than a hundred dollars, in order to receive the necessary document.
Of the new restrictions are affected disproportionately by young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, an African American have 25%, 15% of people with an income of less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 not have the necessary Lichtbildausweis.
This goes further.
The students who are regarded as voters, to cast their votes for the more democratic candidates, it is not permitted in a number of Member States, from its creation to its use Lichtbildausweis issued.
Andererseits the same States allow members of fish or Jagdvereinen, the more the Republican side to choose to use of these associations cards issued for elections.
Before 2004, has called for a federal state, the voters for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state that such a demand is introduced.
For 2011, a dozen laws adopted by the voters States, demand that US-Staatsb to prove their citizenship.
These measures are designed to limit the clearly hispanischen votes.
Because it is clear that only two of the three hispanischen voters, prefer the democratic party.
I also Republican legislators have promoted laws in 2011 in eight states, with which the registration of voters on the day of the elections has been abolished.
I also would have limited the right of individuals and groups, to make those voters want to help.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
Beispielsweise 2004 the campaigns have contributed to the registration of voters in the general election, ca. 10 million citizens to register.
Because since 2009 by the measures adopted to reduce the share of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 17% in 2006.
laws: the Republican legislators have adopted in another five states, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote.
Beispielsweise in the general election in Florida 2008 was 33% of the voters who have chosen an African American in advance, although it only 13% of the voters of the federal state.
hispanische the same goes for the population.
of the latter was only 11% of the electorate, and 24% of the citizens who elected in advance.
In contrast, the White from the 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Of course the democratic legislator and their trailers strongly opposed to the adoption of legislation which restrict the registration of voters.
Several proposals have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The Advocate - General of the United States to intervene to suspend the most contentious legislation.
you were able to limit the damage in part.
Beispielsweise only 16 have adopted the 34 states that the laws are showing a Lichtbildausweises.
But the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics to condemn the political nature of the legislation adopted and seeing them as a clear aim of influencing the results, in the major states for 2012.
A report of the Brennan 2011 - that those of 270 votes Wahlmännergremium are needed in order to win the Presidency, has shown that Member States have adopted this legislation, 171,
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system have a considerable impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in the year 2012.
But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the level of participation.
In this sense, these measures are undermining the democratic system in the United States.
Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not?
The PSA-Test to reject, in fact, sometimes incorrect results with false or negative, but also false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater hesitation, the cowardly men for conducting Früherkennungstests.
Should the test, or not?
We have obtained two consultant's opinion.
The studies conducted in the United States were many disruptors between Kontrollgruppen so that to interpret the data and to give unambiguous recommendations is difficult.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that, when, after 12 years of Nachbeobachtung the likelihood of the education of Metastasen 30 and 40% higher, if no screening was conducted.
As such, I commend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives of the already been to prostate cancer.
When men afro-amerikanischer origin also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to take the right decision was recognised as a form of cancer.
There are other types of cancer and the aggressive the indolent.
According to the patients, the extent of the risk of cancer really made clear by the possible options left unaddressed Prostatakrebse which can, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases for a more active monitoring of the disease is it to be highlighted.
Today many men, in which it has no treatment of cancer, rather than, as it is not and aggressive cancer is not a threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them to progress in the treatment of the disease.
You certainly with greater accuracy of the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who does not.
As such, I would recommend to the implementation of the tests.
The most important, but it is to speak with his GP, in order to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed a device, with which it is possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of PSA-Tests.
This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available very shortly) can be downloaded http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening addressed under the following:
prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the field of research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers prevented if all good enough to eat and would be able to move around.
'If there were no more smokers, this figure will rise by at least 50%, André Beaulieu emphasised, the spokesman for the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
But is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by it.
Several remain unresolved.
For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking of cases is responsible for 85% of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor in several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
'Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million, the spokesperson for smokers' regrets André Beaulieu.
Ermutigende reduce the risk of data, 10 years after the rejection of the cigarettes, to die of cancer.
The weight
According to the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
you seem to increase the risk of breast cancer, Grimmdarm - Mastdarm - Speiseröhren - Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer.
'The research shows that there is a regular physical activity during the whole life of protecting against Grimmdarmkrebs'
The food
The Organisation recommends also to restrict the consumption of red meat.
In on a large scale, it increases the risk of a Grimm - or of the disease.
cooked meats should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by please or long process that could lead to the formation of carcinogens.
'and the body which can harm the development of cancer ', he said.
vitamins
In recent years several scientists have studied the connection between vitamin supplements - and cancer.
your investigations are at present no conclusive.
The Canadian Krebsgesellschaft vitamin E to the studies are contradictory.
During a study to reduce the risk of cancer, like others, has more of an increase.
The effect of Vitamin D on cancer has also still not made quite clear.
I also emphasised that it is Mr Beaulieu as important, with his GP of its concerns and his family - to speak.
'The implementation of a Früherkennungstest not lead to cancer.
The Higgs-Boson analysed
The announcement of the discovery of the probable Higgs-Bosons has aroused last summer a certain, and for good reason.
We believe, in fact, that this Boson nothing for the majority of all the issues in the universe, less than the mechanism is involved
And finally, this is the last of the particles, whose existence of the standard model, our best or the least 'wrong' explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter, empirically, but still not been observed.
But for the physicist it is still not entirely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we have a genuine new particles and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson very similar.
I also believe this to be confirmed by the new data in this week on a major Physik-Kongress were presented in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data, in order to be completely safe.
from walking, we nevertheless, that this is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low level of risk, and what we are looking to us.
There is in this world a crucial law, which inevitably means that two objects the same place at the same time not able to be present.
It is not possible to keep to this rule - and you are not too much, because you will try to hurt.
Because even if the particle physics one world really odd that, for them, also proposed such a law, which states: Ausschlussprinzip Pauli is true that two particles not fill the same place at the same time, when they are in the same 'Quantenzustand', and the 'state' by and large there is for some of their characteristics.
Davon the share a physicist the particles into two categories.
In a corner, the good of the citizens, be described as Fermione and lastly the Pauli-Prinzip.
And on the other, the Bosonen a nasty gang of anarchists nothing sacred, which is in any case not of this principle, which means that they are in fact the same place at the same time can.
This divide Bosonen on the website The Particle Adventure of the laboratories Berkeley (which, incidentally, is absolutely remarkable) into two groups: the Mesonen we are not to be treated and the 'Kraftteilchen' by the spread and the major forces of nature with Higgs-Boson in a way which would be used.
It must be stressed, however, that these Bosonen not all such as it could be exotic are creatures.
If you are able to read this story, then, just a mediocre Bosons of exceptional: the Photon Lichtteilchen 'or' the ``is' boats the electromagnetic force.
If that is an unimportant or accelerated change in the direction of an electrical goods' the electromagnetic fields is disturbed precisely in this place, such as' in a pebble, who was thrown into a pond where.
Indeed, these ``disturbance " (an electromagnetic waves, infrared light or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a Photon Bosonen and therefore one of the`` bearer of force '.
Stabileres field
the same goes for the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another area that Higgs-Feld 'must' be disrupted, so that this Boson.
But Higgs-Feld which is much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the pathogen should achieve very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond where its functions only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be.
And it is a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger like CERN necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km, in order to achieve this type of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic fields is helpful to explain once again, the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It has not, in fact, all the particles are and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic fields.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never be a piece of paper in the refrigerator.
And just as not all of the particles interact with the Higgs-Feld: those who do it, have a majority, while the other (like the Photon) have no mass.
For what all these research can now be 'good' woman wondering Plamondon?
For it is the science of the review of the standard passenger data model (SM), and they allow the Physikern also to examine all the differences between the observations and the predictions of SM.
There are also numerous physicist, the hope that, since such exceptions are the slightest difference and plug open a door to a new 'physics some gaps, the model.
You must say that the latter still major deficiencies, because it offers no explanation for the gravity - ups (!) and of the dark ca. issue that 80% of the subject matter of the universe!) (once again - ups.
But not in CERN such derogations have been found by now.
impact
The effects of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no.
main issues here have thought: are the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell-Laboren that their work in the early 1960s would give rise to such a revolution.
you saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have invented the late physicist Boyle Willard has already said - in the Bell Sail Labs complex has worked in which the lasers in the 1960s, which has been developed since 1962 and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (the first gepulst) has been - that the lasers, at the beginning, rather than an 'Laborspielerei was considered.
posts before you...
can also be applications but also for all the instruments that surrounded the research.
Beispielsweise small Lichtsensor Willard Boyle has developed in 1969, during its work in the optics.
Although it is not the original purpose of this carrier was all digital cameras today throughout the world as the 'eye' and has brought him the Nobel Prize for 2009 physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of our life LHC necessarily change but it does mean that we really know it can never...
Palliativpflege - the best way to Le Devoir death...
With its Committee on 'dignity' death in Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of Lebensendes.
The debate must be included in the near future, although a bill is prepared.
But, to do much more in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still living in his home in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, aufzehrte him, he was given a deadline of two years.
'you gave me to live five years, I have managed to seven years, he said' half - hearted, in bed in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois Beloeil in the sense in which he was reached on the previous day.
'But there is always a shock, it cannot be prepared, it says'.
The disease is doing its work, prevents any weakness, a vast to the toilet and even to go to eat.
On the table a leckeren lunch, he willigt to help a resigned itself to the Essen.
Mutig it even manage to smile and to talk to strangers, which employs around him, he and his medicines offer him a bad.
The courage of the ordinary.
'My it the greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhoea, as this is' humiliating that he shares.
Some hours later found the team has a cure for this evil.
'In the course of our lives, we hear that a man in the foot, Pierre pinkelt Brodeur told' psychologist Victor-Gadbois in the home.
In the Kindheitsphase is for certain persons to return to an intolerable humiliation.
'That depends on the ability of the person' to accept it, is a retrograde step.
Because, according to the number of people working in the Palliativpflege great events are taking place in the midst of this step backwards.
The patients in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois be admitted, are all suffering from cancer.
you have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will be besieged by doctors and nurses, who look after them, not more so - called 'with' curative care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fears of 'and' by suffocation to die.
But by the disease, I have got to know my children.
'I have good children ', there.
'I have no desire to be more in life, it says' before they agreed to be a mask their side to it, will help to breathe.
awaits us in the next few days, a recent visit of her son, in Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois to provide you with a group of varying volunteers and assistance in the food.
The Palliativpflege will be used if there are no other options.
In order to make the programme more pleasant.
The population of Quebec State on a bed Palliativpflege is.
That is when you take into account the very little that we will one day all will die.
Here the life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr declared Christiane Martel, died of the doctors.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual Komforts.
We wish the dying in a Mundpflege brandy or with what Pepsi.
The people must monitor their Blutzuckerspiegel not more.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we have Mr X served a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning is his son austrinken beer at the foot of the deceased.
'We help patients' families and equally, Nathalie Savard Pflegedirektorin reported.
The home Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the other.
Aside from an old man from 93 years, and the latest Familienzusammenkunft in the courtyard well supported by his pillow, while its honour to the issuing of a young man, woman dies from 36 years of his parents and his wife and his two small children, as he is in a tragic way to survive has tried everything.
'For six months' three to five beds are always shown with cancer patients aged less than 45 years, shares with Dr Christiane Martel concerned.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois home from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital.
problem of access to Palliativpflege
The saying goes that 77% of the Canadians have no access to Palliativpflege, in other words a care, to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter is to reach the final stages of their lives, both at home in hospital or in a they have.
And a number of organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic Palliativpflege specialise in the urban area of Montreal more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this very lack of health care in Quebec ensures that several in the specialist doctors Palliativpflege look forward to the adoption of a law regulating of euthanasia assistiertem suicide and with concern.
Since the month of October a manifesto is in circulation, the prominent personalities as Dr Palliativpflege the Balfour Mount and Doctor Bernard Lapointe was signed in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr Christiane Martel Quebec, the health system is not effective enough to ensure that all the right to quality Palliativpflege before we accepted, on euthanasia.
Before long, it says that I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency was taken without measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the patients only because they do not receive adequate health care, want to die.
And at the same time, several oncologists, despite their patients are worst predictions stubbornly until the very last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it has an onerous chemotherapy suspended.
As I have indicated in my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment they replied that it abandons I regret that the battle, they told.
But she had told me that I was in the end.
No omnipotente care
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, nurses, this desire that it has not been taken up, after their pain of a team of Palliativpflege have been arrested.
It must be said, however, the fact that palliative care has clearly the omnipotent Schmerzbehandlung is not.
After Elsie Monereau Palliativpflege, head of the society of the domestic Palliativpflege of Montreal 8% of the patients are not on a Schmerzbehandlung.
Today, at the end of the life of the doctors who are often on the back, terminale Sedierung leading to the patients einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently either by the time of his death.
We can no longer do so, as if we do not take this side of the suffering.
patients without pain relief are going to be increasingly have the possibility to use these terminale Sedierung.
patients, not alleviate the pain, they all say the same thing: 'I want '.
But that does not necessarily mean 'I will euthanise that you' but 'I would like to see my' to alleviate the pain.
The implementation of this report was possible because of a Canadian Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute Journalismusstipendiums.
Immobilienskandale large scale in Quebec
Straßenbauamtes officials of the companies of Bauhauptgewerbes Geldbeschaffer, political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia every day to tell what they say about a great 'system' know, in the construction industry, officials, politicians and trade unionists are embroiled Mafioso.
A 'industry ', the Quebec very expensive for taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
'It is remarkable how the system, since it is' drastic measures, Jacques Duchesneau witzelt taken in Quebec, MEP and a former head of the police in Montreal.
The scandal revealed by the misappropriations due to a thorough investigation in connection with the Treaties in Quebec Straßenbauarbeiten, of the former Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The 'Duchesneau-Bericht' a direct link established between industry, secret funding of parties and corruption of officials.
``Since the start of the investigation in 2010 ', he emphasises that 'only' would have saved the Department of a billion dollars of the treaties, because some zügelten its instinct, in order to receive their share.
The Charbonneau-Kommission 'has already brought two mayors to case, it is also, in the hope that the tactics to identify' behind the individuals can '.
One of the 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
The 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit launched with their troops is to establish, accountants and analysts of Government also a great effort.
: the police officers of the 'Marteau-Truppe' since 2009, which has ensured that the 'Kanalisationskartell Montreal' in the artificial inflation of the Treaties is more...
In recent weeks it has made and a series of accusations of fraud and corruption house raids against local assemblies what Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, which is the mayor of a suburb.
Gilles Vaillancourt would be the next on the list, especially from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec, has resigned.
He is suspected of having received, in exchange for focusing on public contracts.
Ausdrücklich engineers, incidentally, were accused of Montreal Straßenbauamts and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
has aroused by the latter, the Commission explains the functioning of the system for the preservation of public contracts.
He paid several years of 3% of the value of the Treaties in Montreal at one with the Mafia in the mediator, the European Union gave the money in Montreal, the party of mayors Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito in the 2000s had all its hand in it by Canadian dollar was more than 88 000 (EUR 68 ca. Provinzparteien), in particular, about the apparent at the time to the power of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
He acknowledged to have also organised an illegal fundraising for the former liberal Normandeau Nathalie Vice - President.
Kanalisationsverträge, the costs of which were artificially inflated
In Montreal the 'system lasted' corruption smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in the Commission: in ten years the construction company donations, it received invitations to travel, Golf-Turnieren, restaurants and Eishockey-Spielen and bribe amounting to USD 736.000 in return for Kanalisationsverträge it artificially aufblähte their expense.
Other civil servants of the Straßenbauamtes have admitted that they could be schmieren by the accounts with false entitlements to artificially aufblähten 30 -40%.
also an operator, the party of the burgomaster Tremblay Dumont, Mr Martin, that he is accused of deliberately on a Schattenhaushalt füllte of its funds, with black money has been ignored.
Following these revelations Mr is Tremblay resigned Montreal at the beginning of November, which has plunged into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau, was one of the first Members of Montreal, the proposed raising the alarm.
As Mayor of Stadtbezirks Rivière - des-Prairies, in the east of the island, they are rejected as from 2010 to the sale of a Gemeindegrundstücks that for 5 million dollars for 1.6 million of the booming real estate developers was bought and sold.
70% of black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation is carried out in the end, she says that it 'on a theme which will make it possible to understand the operation of the system to pick ants, in order to stop this evil and shaming', which is to blame.
say that the procedure 'is painful, but positive.
We are engaged in the wound up, however, need a certain fraud unit should only for Montreal and supervision in order to avoid the return of the dubious practices.
As it is clean.
Regelmäßig.
Jacques Duchesneau of notes that 'stolen its officials have several hundred million dollars' but, above all, concerned about the role of the 'elected representatives, who are on the' when they were not involved in the fraud.
Starting from 70% of black money in the funding of campaigns in Quebec witzelt it:' Mir has been said that this is just a poor copy of the fact ."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties at 100 dollars, which, according to him, do nothing to change the situation would be: ``As long as the black money in circulation, pre - election campaign expenditure by 'are not strictly limited,
He recommends a complete review of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of political parties: ``We can we not fall, with courage, we get to the bottom of this House can build on a more solid basis for more controls and laws'.
this case the international prestige and Quebec Montreal, Mr damages Duchesneau calls on those who laugh... to take a look in its own backyard
'PSG is not the moment Barcelona!'
In this season PSG you have adopted with a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
You can say it with a personal view, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
significance are players.
Täglich I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has also been much.
These elements to spur me to do this on a daily basis, to improve my Spielniveau.
And in a game that is simpler than that.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I am not from breche in enthusiasm.
Since my earliest days of the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my Spielzeit in gradually Saint-Etienne I have always made progress.
you by Carlo Ancelotti therefore compete with imported from...
The addition of this summer are used to the Olympics, with a very high level.
you also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial.
This means that a player, as I must be inventive and its very best wishes.
Carlo Ancelotti main issues here have much to me in relation to my Spielposition.
He is supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, as I was in the same position.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti a cause for all the technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and it is one of the best trainers of Europe.
He will look back on a rich experience and has won many title with eminent clubs.
He had contact with major players.
I think that it will be further title in Paris.
In January, I had a good discussion with him.
Damals I had just recovering from a Verletzungsserie.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the Spitzenreiters us.
We lurk in ambush, however.
Champions League is one of our most important objectives: we have qualified for us in this way the Achtelfinale.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We will try to come, as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
But we are against a very good European crews to have our say.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in Porto, so that we take the Achtelfinales Heimspiel as the return leg.
Will the PSG be in the short term, a great European club?
He has already for the budget.
For Europe to be a big club, must gain and Paris is entitled to make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Finanziell PSG of the funds so that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it not be a big failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as in the last season was the case?
Of course this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is truly committed to cream off, this title.
In the last season we were close off.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to embrace the victory.
We have reached the end of the season, with a very significant achievement.
We have concluded with 79 points.
should normally be master with 79 points...
However, those of another team, has achieved a better season.
I believe that this is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles I believe - Lyon - Bordeaux or the stuff that we have to gain the title, struggling
thinking that the media, you expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been spent and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that.
If, however, we are against a Heimspiel Troyes 4-0, and it is still what we have to do something, we can say with certainty, which is somewhat frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We can never win every weekend 4-0 with.
We are not the moment Barcelona.
We are trying to set an Spielkonzept.
A team building at the time.
In the Champions League, we have demonstrated our strength.
Manchester City looking to you, a combination of the two Saisons unable, to qualify for the Achtelfinale, and has also made huge expenditure.
In view of the sums invested it was believed you to Spielpause ahead with 15 points.
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would ignore.
Lyon and Marseilles, the last season was not good geboostet 'of this new PSG'.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we, in the month of May will be the winner smiling and tell us that we finally, they have gained, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the services provided.
In order that it better Zlatan-Abh 'independence'.
That means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and too many goals.
And he has come and it shows that it is the 'Star the Ligue 1.
Überall where he has played, it has led to great a player and that he is a world star with respect.
Within the team we respect both the players and the person.
He also respect the people who surround it.
What he has done is exceptional.
This helps to improve their Spielniveau the others.
Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, will make it possible for all the others, also to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
It was very important to me, to the Euro.
Unfortunately my violation has also prevented Spielzeit something.
I saw things that emerged strengthened from which I am.
Today, we will be able to achieve good Games in the national football team.
This has, since I had with the 'Bleus' my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must behave in an exemplary manner in the day.
What do you have to consider the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the 'Bleus'?
He has achieved positive results.
We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The Austrian national coach is strictly, is close to the players and encourages on his victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc tragedy.
But I do not want to make any comparison.
Blanc has to be achieved by giving us for the Euro was qualified.
I hope that the 'Deschamps Didier Bleus' will lead to Brazil.
Stellt that on 16 October in Spain in a forced latched Auftaktspiel (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar line in my career.
The purchasing and selling Bitcoin is possible without Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of the central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties.
I also, as so often in these technologies, is there a political vision: the belief that the current Bankmonopolen, of a monetary system leads to financial crises.
In fact, the pseudonym at Satoshi Nakamoto (a) imaginary Bitcoin is both a virtual currency (in dollars, but EUR convertible currency etc.) as well as a protocol for the safe exchange BitTorrent, as it facilitates the direct exchange of data files.
With 15 000 computers in the network of approximately 200 000 transactions have already been covered.
Several thousand sites Bitcoin accept a donation or as a means of payment.
Following the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, reached a peak of 30 dollars (it was EUR 23 five months later) had USD 2, today, before he has recovered about ten dollars (the courses bitcoincharts.com are listed) on the website.
Nothing Beeindruckendes particularly in relation to the currencies of real world trade or financial products.
however, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest of this.
you Bitcoin describes as' virtual currency with the greatest success ', 'in competition with the dollar or the euro' and 'similar to the traditional currencies'.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the '- credits' that will be used to make progress in a video game that we gain by games or buy (and also sometimes zurücktauschen).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
But every time the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin Netzknoten are all at the same time, repositories of the auditor Rechnungsbuchs Geld-Emittenten and buyers and sellers.
As this network work?
Every transaction between two users in fact taking place between two e - mail addresses in the form of an e - mail.
The difference that users of a payment for each other, what guarantees can the anonymity.
A number of associated with this transaction data electronically signed by a double cypher system.
In this way, the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
it is also possible cooperation of the content of the database to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the entire network of widespread Rechnungsbuch of the public accounts are there.
The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this paper.
This is done through a mathematical task, which will be launched on computers, the winners, of a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier is, has the privilege to add to this additional line.
It is a Zerstückeln of the database, that is, the transformation of a major file in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprinting.
The computer 'take' the new transaction and there are a number of 'before the whole zerhackt'.
The aim is to find that number, it is a special fingerprint (many decimal at the beginning.
If this figure has been found, other knots can easily examine whether it is the right one.
The transaction is associated in the long term with the chain of all transactions, and would change the fingerprint any modification.
If a user Betrügen very quickly to two times (less than ten minutes) pay with the same money would be the only one to two transactions to be validated by the network and the other has no link, as have the two different fingerprints.
The computer, who has been given the task of 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation this prize is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, which leaves a certain amount of room for manoeuvre.
I also the difficulty of the task to be stepped up with any improvement of Rechenleistung.
The lives of the network has already had the ups and downs.
The sites, to provide the services were attacked and Bitcoin Bitcoin-Einlagen stolen.
'The area is not a weakness in the actual Minutes' Pierre Noizat assured, has just Paymium introduced, that is, companies pay for the real money Bitcoin the network.
The ECB has also reported on the possibilities of money laundering, through this anonymous service.
But there is also money on these shortcomings.
important players like Wikipedia Art. deny this donations
Among others, such as the Blog-Plattform WordPress they will be accepted.
Recently, and demonstrated the Adi Rechnungsbuch Shamir have analysed and Dorit Representative Ron of Weizmann-Institut in Israel that almost 80% of Bitcoins not.
In November, a ``Mega-Schlussverkauf was launched '.
'dollar' Dreißigtausend have been exchanged, Jon Holmquist, the company for the working of the few Coinabul Bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, which is also a book about this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.
His Paytunia system is a credit card (with real money) or kontaktlosen payment with a mobile phone, but using Bitcoin the validation of transactions which are cheaper.
I also managed and its identity of the holder can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be implemented with the dealers easy, and the latter must establish a new terminals or computer programs.
you simply have to provide an address by a telephone photographed 'and' that it can be recognised, Pierre Noizat, to have the assurance that he has thousands of users.
It is considered to be a general trend in the hierarchical systems designed to benefit more horizontal systems.
'It will take some time before Bitcoin 2013, but could be a turning point, he predicted.
The ECB is in her report to assess the different risks, today as well - respected in the event of a success of this new currency.
We are deducted from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army, once again, to take ownership of their territory and that the Afghan people to decide their future, without anything to expect from us.
We have to be punished by the Afghan farmers in particular, we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers who have been killed and injured and Versehrten.
The Taliban are from foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also for farmers, who refuse to armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
you want to defend their centuries - old and archaic traditions, although jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
the latter will not be more Toleriert, sometimes because of the local insurgents supported, if the western countries are renowned.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab I Mandelbäumen replaced by a hill have observed the French credit has been properly funded.

From the end of 2014 Einströmen there will be no more of the Taliban regime in Kabul.
Since your irresistible advance of 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
Damals Kabul was empty and excessive the country because of the struggles of the various groups in seditious by the war.
your coup was seen as a kind of liberation and then return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the al - Qaeda, overthrew their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahedin the Afghan Government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a position of inferiority.
The most important figures of anti- Soviet war came to power in 2001.
you have turned into businessmen, land seized by the government, in order to sell and took them as housing development of refugees from Iran and Pakistan so benefit from the huge American of subcontracting.
you have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.
As I have heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people are leaving the country, as those who make the American support to the flight of capital that is significant.
The young people have had enough of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran and Pakistan have they had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has a population of 5 million, which is one - fifth of the population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
This young people, who are neither the obscurantism of former parties still on the corruption of certain leaders want to return, we will have to provide jobs.
All the armed parties are obsessed with mobile phones, with its Turkish television sets, which is a modern world, will be seen everywhere.

With regard to the authorities, under whose authority they will be as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti- Soviet war are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province, which will be the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities would have a certain degree of decentralisation of the example of the Western nations are to benefit, but through the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, since the 1964 constitution of the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai not foreign to controls, in particular at the elections planned for April in 2014.
But his country since the 1950s and is already long dependent on outside aid.
industries have not been rebuilt, viable Stauwerke are not there and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported, apart from fruit and vegetables is nothing.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country which has been ruined by 30 years of war, a state control would be the infrastructure needed.
The rumour circulated that Afghanistan has had enormous natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the western countries, whose only in order to conquer space.
Without energy, to digest the iron or Kupfererz on the ground without transport, or for the export of the mountains of mining is not possible.
The Chinese have already almost leave the copper mine, the international Aynak Mes of archaeologists (be financed by the World Bank on the huge Buddhist place their archaeological excavation team and the main employer remain the province.
One day, it will be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely imports and exports are subject to establish normal relations.

A Constitution with the battering in Egypt
It is a new game of poker of President, Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt with regard to the temporary Verfassungserklärung, the unlimited power, more than ever, it is still divided, has decided to put everything on a card.
Regarding the surprise of all he has delivered on the Wednesday of the constituent assembly, the next day will adopt its final version.
It is just a week ago, the Head of State has given to this House the two more months to complete its work.
Egypt is now for nearly two years ago, in a provisional text amended several times, which weakens and institutional stability leads to a legal confusion.
This new initiative only provides for greater division of the country.
For his opponents of the President remains in its' autocratic ended by 'to' break 'and' be the right word 'being trampled underfoot.
On pages of his supporters, you assured us that it is the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process is a way.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, the forced to abandon the brothers on their projects, the Egyptians to explain the text for paragraph of paragraph.
For the President, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging across the country.
After the contrary, in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians to vote favourably.
Zumal an ultimatum the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote, put it:' is true for my draft or I reserve the right to unlimited power ', the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution are supposedly an end.
85 largely Islamic members of the constituent assembly, the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberal Group has not responded to the call.
short Verfassungserklärung before the middle of November they have warded off, as they are of the opinion that they have not been able to put their views are promoted.
representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society have acted in the same way.
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning were added in a hurry, 11 people members.
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators have enjoyed incidentally, that the only difference of the day in the late hour for the prayer is to say, as some members of the committee were of the opinion that the Pendeluhr the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text that was adopted yesterday evening, is 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew attention to all who, after all, the same as that of the Constitution from 1971 and states that 'the principles of the Sharia law are the main source of the law'.
The salafistischen parties, for the establishment of the Islamic law is an important requirement, had hoped to replace the principles of 'by the rules, which would have made it possible for a stricter application.
For the Islamists the fact is that this article has not changed, to demonstrate its good will and on their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
'hypocrisy ', the Liberals say that this only as Propagandaschlag.
Because the Islamisation of them is through other articles of the constitution.
Mr President, you have in mind particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar placed a consultative role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Mrs Ägyptenspezialistin Pommier this is worrying, because the people who will be called on to give its opinion, have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see that the first signs of a theocracy '.
The fears of the Liberals also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the University of much less than the present should be measured.
'At no specific religious commitment to see.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
The majority of lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, Alexis Blouet appeased, which lays down a thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition.
He is a recognised that 'but in relation to Article 220 there is an ambiguity, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It is here, in particular, to the 'Fiqh '[ Islamic law, red, Mr President.
And in the future could be raised the question of the extent to which Zivilrichter are competent to decide '.
In his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday, heavily criticised because of the far - reaching powers and the President of the Republic.
The known as Muslim Brothers argue that this comparison with the former regime are significantly reduced.
A further point of contention: the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, not Parliament, which will be put to the test, but just a national Defence Council.
Just there is no ban on civil proceedings, as requested in military courts the human rights associations.
latter with also share her concerns in relation to the text that they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
I also have no article refers more to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
During the Egyptian President, yesterday evening on the television demonstrations that are planned for today had this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State on Saturday will be.

'The large and powerful' by Moscow: migrants will save money for language
As parliamentarians and civil rights activist, what point about the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals are discussing will act with fake certificates
market 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow and St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
The majority of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your sole aim is to make money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the country.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which any working immigrant, a test for the knowledge of the Russian language must be certified.
No, this regulation applies only to migrants in the services sector, in the local housing stock and to work in the retail trade.
Jedoch the tests should be according to the time Föderaler Migrationsbehörde compulsory for all migrant workers in the future.
Mr President, we must not only language tests for tests, but also in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
language skills must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and extension of the work permit.
exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Ebenfalls of this law will be excluded from the people who receive their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the break - up of the Soviet Union in 1991.
sense issue and protection of human rights
The whole of the Prüfungsstellen under the aegis of the Puschkin-Instituts for the Russian language, the Russian University of the friendship among peoples, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can all the tests in cities; now in Russia more than 160 appropriate centres already been opened.
The initiative on the implementation of the tests was supported by the members of the Duma and the Federal Migrationsbehörde.
civil rights activist, however, before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press, the following question: What is all this about?
What changes does the provision of languages, to deliver both for the Russians and the migrant workers?
In particular, the spokesman for the Migrationsbehörde say, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labourers.
``Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, the head 'says the representation of the Federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
your rights must be protected, but they had left already.
Just an organised recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future without necessarily the migrant languages people are putting it under the pretext of aid in the dark, close shack with dozens of assembling, where he and his ilk months without food and documents 12 to 14 hours of the day, will be able to meet, is ill - intentioned
We have achieved many complaints from our migrants.
'In the country, you promised this one, and it has been duped, you will get their passports and not the' promised, the head of the headquarters for migration, the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow.
Not, head!
however many citizens of the Central Asian republics, in Russia who want to earn money that they control not only the language of the country of destination, but also in their own language, can hardly in writing.
Of course that is not their fault, but rather the evil: Just a few the Turkmen people can afford them and Tajiks a sensible of primary education.
Because there are still in their families do not even have money to feed the children, let alone to buy them, proper clothing, footwear and Schulsachen.
As these children, teenagers to take the first opportunity for making money.
'It is difficult not to be' languages.
'You humiliated and inferior fühlst thee.'
civil rights activist in terms of the law to stress the following important aspect.
The test only to legal migrants.
Did you not this status, there are no examination and thus no official work.
Währenddessen the vast majority of the migrant workers is also illegal in Russia.
'Herzlich welcome' or 'entry ban for unauthorised'
Many migrants confirm that in Russia to receive an official status is not easy.
The reasons are bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
: legalising costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rouble.
A false registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents and we are not registered, and then to be cases of blackmail.
'you are one or two hundred rouble for cigarettes and tea, expresses the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
'Bloß spare no expense on false papers'
Right on the day on which the law was entered into force, that it is not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates to certify the completion of the language tests of staff, the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen were already.
The counterfeit documents were printed Farbdrucker with a normal.
Of course the new owners of these were not free of charge: Any migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid seven thousand rouble of the document.
That is more than twice as much as the costs of the official test: This costs three thousand rouble a migrant workers.
I that the most important task is to direct the system there is corruption, so that certificates to protect cannot simply be bought, both are officials and human rights activists.
For the moment, the authorities can immigrant workers in the first time by the test, only promise that they will be time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
I also offer newcomers languages are without jobs in areas where no active dialogue with people is necessary.
Interior ignored illegal arms market
proportion of legal weapons to offences extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of Waffengesetzes for private Waffenbesitzer.
That the authorities to respond to the recent events in shootings, injuries and deaths in the golden age of seven of the Moscow has Winogradow Dmitri lawyers.
The police and increase wants to ban the wearing nicht-t ödlicher weapons in the public the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported and the chairman of the promised Duma-Ausschusses for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, that the amendments will be tabled shortly on Arms Act of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities to combat the problems of the screws' by 'attraction.
The Internet has been an open letter published its author, representatives of various Waffenverbände - call on the authorities to tighten up of 'stupid'.
The per cent of the crimes of the registered with weapons is very low, the experts in criminal law, the Russian service Wasilij Lesnikow, the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while thousands of offences 1,168 as a whole have been recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter across are convinced that an intensification of the law on private Waffenbesitzer criminals not hold on to the black market.
For the moment, we can find the authors in Moscow any weapon for little money.
Währenddessen the Ministry of Home Affairs emphasises that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
suppliers: of the factories to the officers
The arms are several channels on the black market.
There are five main channels such a former colonel, Viktor Baranez told, in the Ministry of ten years and was the General Staff.

The first is to channel the army and the armed forces, which  h. weapons during the conflict in the Caucasus has been stolen.

At the second channel illegal weapons, which are stolen Ordnungshütern of criminals.
Baranez explained that these weapons are both from the Waffenkammern directly by the police and the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.

There is another channel smuggling of the black market.
special about 140g pistols and many weapons come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
'in its own, there are sometimes small - scale production and a mafia, the organised' smuggling, the former soldiers.
How do the weapons come from?
experts charged, about what the contribution of each of the five channels of the supply of the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was drafted by the Centre for Problemanalysen and public administration.
The experts are considering reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for National Statistics, forensic literature and publicly accessible data on web portals on the subject of arms.
The majority of illegal weapons investigators, comes from the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden.
The half of all weapons on the black market has to be 'by' fault of those responsible in their work to do with weapons, it says in the report.
The data of researchers, 17% of the weapons come from areas of conflict, 14% to theft in the arms industry and 5% comes from illegal archaeological excavation team.
An Verkaufsberater a Waffenladens not specifically mentioned, will be assured that for a long time, no one is buying arms, the illegal dig has to be found, because they are out of date.
he says that it is more likely that the supplies, traders in getting a weapons.
Over a Fähnrich a weapon, for example, to buy a pistol TT of the same type.
The weapon and be issued by the fence.
'The trader is the weapon in the city and sells them there for EUR 900 per with two magazines, he told'
'The police, of course, know everything and, therefore, if they do not observe the plan for the detection of crime periodic offer Kontrollkäufe dealers' illegal weapons, which adds Verkaufsberater there.
'As the Luxusladen'
buyers and sellers find most about acquaintances.
I was looking websites and blogs, as someone who has been on the table, and a person's attention to a certain place where we could negotiate the price, which would like to wait, I suggested to station 'Begowaja',
I learned The price for the only weapon where

There are on the markets, but we must go there and agreeing on a code 'of Ivan Iwanowitsch that will be, the daughter has lost a tooth'.
I come now to a few Schlagringe even on a friend, I trust.
He is also the Schlagringe only because he knows that I am not verpfeife it.
newcomers to the different ways of looking for weapons.
The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of the 1990s, the purchaser of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this issue.
The scheme, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a Fotoalbum, which was illustrated 'everything'.
'I felt as the Luxusladen ," the soldiers.
The buyers Baranez is not according to the pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I buy a potential client does not simply go, but with the seller in the forest, and we ask for a target.
'I can then go there, and when I say that the weapon has a good measure of am convinced that, together, we are negotiating, which describes the expert approach.

A Makarow for USD 100
During the purchase of illegal firearms is, according to the experts, to count on price of USD 100 to 900.
According to Mr Kislow of the organisation 'Pravo na oryzhie' you can buy a gun type Makarow for 100 and 300 dollars.
We must wait until a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military Waffenlagern of supervisory medium - sized.
The official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences back with illegal arms across Russia in the period between January and October 2011 22,9 thousand to 7%, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail in relation to arms, ammunition and explosives and devices of 7.8%.
In the United States, and of them went on strike Supermarkt-Besch äftigte
Any fourth US young people at the sitting behind by Donald's McCarthy
In the last few days in the US there has been massive protests against low wages in shops and restaurants of Wal - Mart popular Fast-Food-Ketten as McCarthy, Donald's burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
As no one can predict whether the protests by swelling further or whether they will soon be back to the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and many left - wing non - profit - making organisations.
Aside from the increase in the modest wages of simple Wal - Mart Fast-Food-Besch and the organisers of officials are following the protests of the aim to set up trade unions.
No one is hardly organised this sector of the economy.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so - called black Friday, which took place in the United States, the sales anlockten millions of customers, which sometimes too Handgemengen.
This day some Walmart-Mitarbeiter laid down in the world, of which there are, 2.2 million of their work and, together with trade unions and left - wing activists bestreikten branches of the chain which is targeted at people are low and middle - income.
Wal - Mart, all the products sold, of children's nappies and on Jagdgewehre Autobatterien to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.
The products in the average Walmart-Filialen is between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
As such, the many buy a slightly Walmart-Besch paid officials only on our own work.
The prices and Wal - Mart Warensortiment made one of the largest companies in the United States.
critics Wal - Mart that can sell the goods are often only right, because the people are badly paid.
latter also complain about serious conditions, forklift zum Beispiel lack of or Handscanner.
The participants of the protests of the 'black Friday called' wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the insurance betriebseigene from 30% to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter 9.5  US - dollar, which deserves the moment, this increase is not doing, they have said.
researchers from the Californian university in Berkeley show that, if the company - hour average pay the increased to 12  Dollars the Wal - Mart, would cost of 3.2 billion dollars.
These are ca. 1.1% more than they are now fighting for employment.
dignity Wal - Mart fully pass on the increases in salary at any cost, the customers buy only 46 cents more in the future.
Pro year compared with today, for it would be an increase in expenditure of only 12,39 dollar.
supporter of Wal - Mart, please note that only in nine federal states to protests, and this has caused the businesses of any losses.
The black Friday was not in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and the next day, in that period, Article sold Wal - Mart, approximately 5 000 per second.
Overall Walmart-Kassen the 'black Friday' almost 100 million from had transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview on the website of the left - wing Huffington postal services, that a total of 'less than five' Walmart-Mitarbeiter niederlegten and the work of the action of a merely 'stunt' of the trade unions, the protests have been organised.
Farming 'free'.
The protests were to continue this week in New York, where the aim, however, were not Walmart-Filialen (in the progressive city so far non - existent are therefore not desirable, but McDonald's and other low - cost restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion chickens, and yet no Krankentage to you, and you will not pay for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, who is a member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage in accordance with a federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollar is the hour.
In Fast-Food-Restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much on average, and their ordinary people in New York of USD 8,90 the hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
How is it possible, in New York, with so little money is beyond me.
There was even a time when almost a quarter of all American young people in school at McDonald's behind the Theke, however, the young people were living in their parents.
Only a was seen as the main source of income or planned to revive, continue to remain there.
Well I meet in interviews with staff at McDonald's constantly people complain that it with this wage and sometimes even manage to feed their children.
Andererseits are there in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a comment, the rapporteur points out, it is irresponsible to have children, if we did not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6.00 a.m. in the morning before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Avenue Madison, demanded that the bank teller and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants receive a minimum wage of USD 15 the moment which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage is in line with that.
you called for the education of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche.
The US law prohibits the governance, this objective to stand in the way of trade or to issue early warnings to and made redundant.
Andererseits the management, it is not easy.
The foundation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
are unhappy
Lautstarke protests it was on this day, many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was an Assembly at midday, McDonald's Times Square on, which were some local democrats, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, who said ,' McDonald's, billion chickens sell, and yet no Krankentage to you, and you will not pay for your honest work. '
The demonstrators have been supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that 'we support the Fast-Food-Mitarbeiter together so that they receive and achieve a fair wage should be the economic prosperity that everyone deserves New York.
According to the New York Times this was the main action of its kind in the history of the US Fast-Food-Industrie.
Jedoch only a few hundred people were on the ground, which is far from all in the Fast-Food-Branche are employed in New York in the tens of thousands of work.
As we do not yet know whether the flame of these protests mobilise a whole.
'The brain is so far only moderate' dupe those
The supporters of modern technologies in popular subject of the enlarged reality is usually recently through the lens of a specific perspective.
Firstly, in the summer, Google, at its annual meeting in November, a working model was then known that Microsoft had declared an adequate patent.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Microsoft-Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, is clear that the prism of the scientists of the company was only a staging post.
you anew the opportunity to manipulate and virtual property with their bare hands in the air to create virtual Freiflächen.
- you Beschreiben short, what research your group.
We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the limit of this interaction.
No humanity is largely remained stuck in the period in which to work with Pixeln preferably, sometimes be affected.
We, however, look to foresee 5 -10 years and the radical changes to this interaction.
Beispielsweise the Xbox-Konsole Kinect-Sensoren are a step forward, and nowadays Xbox will no longer be sold Kinect, since all the interested for Bewegungssteuerung.
What we have in the future?
Kinect - Although the interaction of a physical level, a great deal has to play in the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change the working, on real three - dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the Computerwelt in our physical world and comprehensible.
The same applies, however, it is important that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
Then we could add to the real world of virtual objects much easier.
And these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-Helme, first and foremost, we should be starting to happen.
What do you think about Sprachsteuerung -?
is liked you, but they will not be exaggerated.
- it is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, since it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always Umstehenden all information about his actions and intentions.
Eigentlich any kind of interaction with computers, however, is any good, in their specific detail.
For example, we were working in the field of governance of objects in public places to a project in which we, with short and limited, rather than ausladenden experimentierten gestures.
Let the gestures were recorded Objektkamera not by the Council, but by a Armband, the registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
As it is a relatively large, could in theory be reduced to the size of a wristwatch, however.
But overall, the future belongs to, for example, joint Steuerungstypen Gestik and language.
- As this?
We would like to ask you - for example, to offer you these Sprudeldose?
you to say it and, at the same time.
I am normally simply.
- well, that would be very difficult to understand.
- the Heißt, you want the users adapt to what a machine can make the relevant time and what is not?
- It is not important, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that in the next period, in particular, to the development of new types of the responses to enable more people to work.
That can be Lasersensoren for example in the depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
What you are basis of your work with the demands of modern cameras Xbox Kinect-Sensoren?
Mangelt of disintegration, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of the three - dimensional detection.
Of course Megapixel 8 would be at a rate of one thousand fps not bad.
However, the main not Megapixel which are themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
However, all the current technologies are not good enough, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It is not only the disbanding along the X, Y and - but also along the Z-Achse be taken into account.
Even the speed, and the number of a second images are important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps in particular gestures are too little.
Stephen Betishes in our developed in a laboratory Redmond Berührungssensor with a regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 -100 Millisekunden, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 and 100).
Not all understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
To my work I had only just such an instrument without Berührungssteuerung and with more pictures per second.
- will increase the number of cameras Müsste not?
- Kinect is currently working with three 'cameras ', but one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the date, signal.
And the third is indeed a camera ordinary RGB-Kamera.
you is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.
More cameras may be able to solve the problem.
Oder compound the problem, because more calculations are necessary.
system would be a flexible, check Kinect - similar in which we could play with various Kameraneigungen to see us, as in the case of the three - dimensional identifying a position to provide help.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, in contrast to his glasses Google not the public.
thinking you not think that, as regards the use of technology in the everyday reality of the enlarged glasses, the best prospects?
Of course, it is not always pleasant, on their way to keep in the hands of a smart phone, but I believe the following: The tollste formula would be an 'rotating' enlarged reality, in which we have a cloud of the prism of the smart phone, could switch
The impact is a personal 'gadget' and its strength lies (private you can see only), but also, at the same time its weakness: an enlarged reality through wear glasses that you, together with others to virtual objects able to work.
- posts before us a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air from not only Mr Stark Iron Man, but also Normalsterblichen is accessible.
There is a problem, to the critics often this idea: There is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
What answers to give your group on this point?
- In my lectures I often talk about the importance of the extended reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of taktilen perception.
An interesting method currently use of second - hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
you true takes pressure excellent.
There are, however, also technologies which are actually designed to 'pictures in the air ', something concrete to, for example, the number of collisions Ultraschallstrahlen aimed at a certain point, the finger is a feeling that at the moment, but so is weak, as someone Handballen pustete on.
It also ties to the Commission on the Nervenendungen in the fingers of one hand, this is also a possible way.
Have you tried to dupe those, the brain?
There I think that what the European Union should see it, if it is just a little?
- This is a good idea, so we still have not tried it.
Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person physically in a closed area, to believe that he was instead in an open, virtually never - ending area; we are working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in gyms too), mobile platforms and major bullets.
No, the brain, and only moderately dupe those before us for many years of hard work for.
That is precisely the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher rather this: In many issues we are only just beginning.
Eigener taste ru rosbalt - instead of culture.
Rosbalt is the project 'Petersburg vanguard ," which is devoted to city dwellers, which are the avant - garde of the art and culture.
On the fine list already high - level representatives, of the Petersburg Kunstszene, whose achievements on the borders of the city and the often go beyond recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be aware.
The new hero of the artists is Rosbalt extravagante Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller, the red - clad Bärtigen that we may, to the Russian museum Sommergarten, or Vernissagen Szene-Treffen in them.
Where are the images of Kirill Miller, they also be issued to attract huge crowd.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists, which are creating new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personalities of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 1980s, or at the beginning of the 1990s.
He is a man of the city and by pulling its presence in the street with a smile on the face of its citizens and is causing them for good humour.
Before he recently schnappte a Drehorgel and the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as it is for these difficult role in terms of its Künstlerdasein, its image and its underlying philosophy was finally ready.
- Kirill why you are always in red and not for example in the city or Türkis?
I have chosen a red Modedesigner on the optics and the image.
In this world of red is the compromise between artists, spin - doctors and society.
In a society is something quite different from what the Graunorm, aggression and bad behaviour.
I want to make my provocation but with the people.
Every an invitation was my last provocation to the discussion.
When you - wusstest painter, that you have to be?
- In an exhibition in Kulturpalast Newskij were issued, in my work.
I realised that this is the way to go.
Then the period of the old free, but not officially recognised that painters, and new and free painter such as I was incomprehensible.
I like the painters are on friendly terms with the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the 'Gazonewschina; hence, ``Puschkinskaja 10, and then it was even closure.
It is there to the theatre, to fashion, music, literature, in addition to all.
So, all of the united in your Art-Klinik... It was important to me, in the centre of the Petersburg culture, where the best should creative artists.
In 1995, an area in which I occupied Puschkinskaja 10 and there to the renovation musikalisch-k ünstlerischen a club for the Boheme the House of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with its project 'Ucho Van Goga to'.
string and his friends, simple songs on Play-back, wearing T - shirts and close to them and which today was mature composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group was started to play in Leningrad, its' live '.
Trachtenberg moderierte many programmes before the time of 'Halli-Galli'.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began its great careers, but he met with us.
Even the gallery'D 137 'or the' club 'Griboedov have their origin in Art-Klinik.
Dorthin Stammgäste and our staff.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there have been in the press, a survey of the prize 'personalities of our town of'.
I received in the category of 'artists of the year, and I was reached peak.
It is not easy in new times for old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to be renowned, but culture and popularity are not the same: the famous It would be without a cultural contribution to make.
- your work, a distinctive form.
Many images, my very real gems and the timeliness and rigour of the idea.
I will be an exhibition on the issue of 'The Russian museum as students'.
students are timeless.
I was socially however painful, but it now and is preparing to be afraid of.
In a clown the blurred and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I was grotesque ideas.
- saving the world, for example by making that everyone has to dress up completely.
It respects everyone in the clothing and is based on the Outer and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should give a people, but should not be biting the face of it.
The deceit by the Verkleiden disappear.
Before you - we saw recently in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers. - A City of Culture should have as a hero.
Who, if not I?
- commercial art Will it be?
Nowadays, must be cautious, with commercial art and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
however, people were the major groups: The Bohemiens liebten the An ordinary people and the other.
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to all.
I am no Einhundert-Dollar-Note that everyone likes.
Now, you have to consider what you will.
Now everyone Kultstar has approximately 100 supporters.
- On the appearances by Stas Michailow but there are several thousand.
- On him, abandoned women sexuell-soziale the world plays a role.
The 300 people and cultural reasons, not ten thousand, consequently, there is less money management, and everything.
I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to deceive and they do not destroy what we have achieved.
In my youth I have painted such images to a collector even in a series of pictures of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures, which normally only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
consumption has no culture, this is something quite different.
I am a man of the past, culture and with artists, who were living in poverty and died in poverty and money, in order to be able to raise.
That is the culture, which I support.
- Kirill what Petersburg?
- the best Kulturexperten.
It says: servants of culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars it was different, because the Tsars may not seen much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
The St. Petersburg, we have the experts, but they could be blocked, the way in which it is properly assess hochrangigerer experts and the former open to them.
Now only one's own taste.
Erarta applies to do this, however, with the difference that they say in all honesty that it does not accept any contemporary art and therefore some painters need to seek other museums.
- Concerning for thee Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.
At our stones art can only grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground for example, because we now have more than reader writers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many people who are visiting organises concerts exhibitions or.
For us, these are much less.
art must again be up - to - date, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be financed from grants the town of St Petersburg
birth in outer space
Earth in danger.
global warming or clash with Killerasteroid.
Karawanen of spacecraft Erdbewohnern to make on board to the quest for a spare planet.
In order to save the human race, the important question of how we can or zero gravity to reproduce a spare planet?
Many choice is not in my opinion.
De facto there are only two real planet, we could at least on a hypothetical.
'Nämlich Mars and Venus ', says the scientific staff of Vladimir Surdin Astronomischen Sternberg-Instituts.
During the conditions on the surface to Mars are comparatively lebensfreundlich the Venus, a temperature of 500 level.
life would be only in large level or within the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The issue of the researchers in space first discussed in terms of the flora.
Right carried out half a century before that experiments have to plants.
The fourth generation of the in - orbit peas was bred not in the slightest by the irdischen species.
It followed the breeding of insects, in greater detail by tiny Fruchtfliegen (Drosophila) in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier have been sent out into, in order to explore how the zero gravity has an impact on the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
However, this problem.
'The problem is that the chicks find must stop; it must be able to stand on its own feet and start to get' Laborleiter explained, the Institute for medizinisch-biologische RAN problems, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground when the wild, chicks.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn stumpften from complete.
The chicks Laute and not reacting to light.
Four days later, be they died.
'Zweimal we have made a slip chicks and then see the whole thing, because it considers them Sychew Vladimir with the' experiment has failed to work with, chicks in space is simply impossible.
The last Brutkäfig with animals flew into orbit, 16 years ago.
In spring 2013 to the experiments be continued.
Jedoch Biosatelliten on the 'only' Bion of the same sex are species are.
There was an experiment with rats fertilised already sent into space.
 (DE) In principle, it has been said here.
'It was precisely with the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and research must be continued, Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing Weltraumratten got the offspring.
The problem was directly in the space of one has not yet been resolved.
The task is a difficult one.
animals that are taken from their natural habitats, can follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb not.
In contrast to the individual animals may in principle.
The Homo sapiens abstraktem is capable of thinking and to produce a similar emotional tide.
There are ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
However, women to fly into space for 50 years.
, Tereschkowa The greatest risk.
The Wertvollste that the human race has is the female body.
Our Möwe plane, and no one in the world should have been able to answer the following question: they Übersteht the Weltraumflug?
Will it, after this flight can bring a child into the world?
Lastly, no 'answered this question' Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse says.
In June in 1964, just one year after its Weltraumflug result, the first female Kosmonautin Valentina Tereschkowa, a girl.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 result if the second in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja who was twice in - orbit and even work outside the Raumfahrzeugs a son.
Even so the risk remains.
We have only very few Kosmonauten, after long flights and they got was all very healthy new blood.
``The more, the dangerous, even on flights into orbit ', Kosmonaut concludes Valeryi Poljakow hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.
And yet the humanity needs to find new methods in the field of biotechnology, the artificial radiation protection and the Erzeugen Gravitation.
The Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum in the Kosmonauten is a compulsory stage during the ground.
Here in a state of flux the routine Kosmonauten gain for the work in the open space.
The water is zero gravity of the problem.
Even if adults water as a pleasant feel it is a strange surroundings; but babies are water as a natural element.
It is the small Ichtyander would testify to the life of the country is turning the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child in approximately nine months in the mother Fruchtwasser, and that it will then be easier to get used to water.
In principle it is logical, as from the cradle to the first to go swimming just two weeks ago.
'That is too little time to forget' Babyschwimmlehrerin says something, Marina Aksenowa.
As for a new - born baby the zero gravity natürlicherer so much from a woman is the state of affairs is not defied without.
In the state of the zero gravity back the gut Beckenmuskulatur and very quickly, and it is therefore also the ability to extract the child.
All right, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could take place, for example, in a Spezialkammer to extract the child.
``But what happens? ', which is no insignificant matter of Valeryi Poljakow.
Andererseits the child needs also defied artificial.
Without the Erdanziehung, to feel the body can train the skeleton and muscles.
A new - born child could be set as an adult in - orbit to train in a Belastungsanzug.
he simply lack the will for his life, which is of fundamental importance.
'This experiment which we jointly, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we have an entirely unangepassten a disabled people in the world ', says, the director of the institute for Bioethikkommission medizinisch-biologische, Igor Pestow RAN problems.
No the birth of children in outer space is merely a theory.
Irgendwann however, it is a reality if the people in their spacecraft a distant planet is the home of the space for their offspring born heading.
NKÚ - head: control of Schwarz-Systems by the failed policy
the Czech Republic has, in relation to public contracts, have good control bodies and adequate legislation, however, is in its application.
In conversation. cz Aktuálně to say this to the Vice - President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, Miloslav Kala NKÚ).
'A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I believe that that is not the case of' Kala commented on the current situation.
On a similar result also seems to be a common control by Czech and the German auditors.
The negative Praxisbeispiel it leads to the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so - called ``Schwarz-System '.
Unlängst the Prime Minister said that the ODS hector the entrepreneurs with them or not, the system is now would be banned?
must have a valid law, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende, and hinder the surveillance office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law in its activity Kala notes.
At the sitting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, in the framework of the legislation on public contracts were both countries compared with each other.
Worum was because in practical terms?
There is a parallel with the review of some two years ago we started.
Vereinfacht said, it is important that the European legislator lays down, public contracts are to handle the national legislation on:'.. And finally, there is the real practical application.
This all we have gathered, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have seen is extremely interesting differences. It is generally said that the laws are we are perhaps even a little 'strict and perfect, but the real application in Germany is better in some parameters.
That confirms that we must always look at it again with the new and more precise rules to establish proper application of the law, is not enough.
to what extent you the project can be a help for you? What emerges from this project?
That is precisely such a joint control could contribute to this, that we must stop constantly seeking to perfecting the laws and the lowering of thresholds, and balancing if it is apparently not very good.
efficiency means to acquire a matter of excluding and at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) illegitimate wealth or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts cannot guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that we are a burden on the system in this way with excessive paperwork 'only' and those who seek to exploit loopholes in the system, the system simpler than the threshold values have remained higher.
you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
As the system works in Germany?
Is there a similar body here as our NKÚ, or the system operates in a different way?
What concerns the authorities, it is the German equivalent NKÚ the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to what we have built up and also by a college, that will only be set up in a slightly different way. In principle, however, the two authorities are working.
Even the competences are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany is, however, a federal state, in other words that there are these courts of auditors in the individual states, the German system is different from our own.
The federal funding only BRH must control, which is in line with our public funds.
Public funds are managed by the districts and communities, there will be subject to the control of Landesrechnungshöfe.
What concerns the German legislation, is the easier than ours?
What I would like this without any definite indications only Nichtsdestoweniger Germany, in some respects, is often described as a model, but we certainly cannot say that Germany in particular, is better.
Liegt that, perhaps, that the auditors are better?
That certainly not, but as I have said, which I do not particularly like to make comparisons.
Hierzu that those countries which for us are a model, also with the problems it is facing.
If this were not the case, it would not be true cooperation with our authority, not?
What concerns the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority had Vergabegesetzes of the amendment, you have any consequences?
In view of the fact that these amendments only a short time in force, it is not yet in our assessments.
Since our controls take place later, we must here with a degree of delay.
feel we have so far been rather in the preparation of future controls, we have introduced the new instrument of control and identification of risks of 'waste' in this almost 14, public procurement - examined and analysed the amendments will have an impact, of course, as the thresholds, the conditions for certain types of invitations to tender, among other things, have been modified
Can you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think and hope that this law is a step in the right direction that confirms this assumption.
It can, however, the problem is that the rules will be strict 'and' can no longer be respected.
Right from the previous rules, a verification unterzogenen people are against the agencies (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) to be accountable, so that any failure to respect the Vergabegesetzes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it sensible, however, then we have to make the law?
In my opinion, it is not this way.
The system must exclude and those who want to abuse the system, and not penalise those who have made a formal errors, not on the actual decision - making.
A system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
we say, first of all, what is not good.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS lay not entrepreneurs with controls of the so - called ``Schwarz-Systems' - what exactly does this mean?
Is this now or permitted Schwarz-System banned?
A law must, however, have its period of validity, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende and impede the surveillance office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: ``We amend the law and allow the matter, but he could not say that we would be as if nothing to do.
It contains a relatively strict rules on procurement law which owes much to the formal out certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also a tragedy if the offeror with the best offer Formfehlern solely on the grounds of being excluded.
The law never will be perfect, but it must be applied properly, and that is what I think is missing.

At our concerts Šimon Ornest: we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world that, in less than a month to take place?
This is one of those Katastrophenmeldungen, to which we are so keen to function.
With our band The Tap Tap we are rather fun and to say that we are the only link to the world of the collecting sufficient positive energy in order to prevent or stop the end of the world, can.
In December, you have kept also a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine our readers to this project?
It is a national Benefizveranstaltung, which we are already two years.
Hierfür we want to use the Marketingpotenzial Maya-Kalenders of the end of the day, is forecast for the 21 December at 11:10 a.m..
The day before, that is, on 20 December, from three organises concerts at 21:00 at the same time take place in Prague and Ostrava Brno.
The end is organises concerts about the time of Kiribati on the Pacific in a zone of 12 hours before us is the Maya-Kalender.
From whom this idea?
My original, then I think we have reached together with the idea of our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
Let us not only to collect sufficient positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, we should also consider, together with the public, but in which we state our children all over the world.
The end of the Maya-Kalenders we have developed a unique range of shoes, T - shirts, pockets and Schlüsselanhängern against the end of the world, with whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz we can also support the people.
The band The Tap Tap has begun, together with other actors also the so - called national anthem against the end of the world with the title 'statements from is'.
The very today the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also being proposed in the Benefizkonzerten?
Of course, at the very end, provided that all the work and the end of the world is not taking place.
The hymn sung by all actors to be at all three concerts at the same time.
the anthem also be broadcast live together in a Direktschaltung the Czech television.
The text of the anthem was played by Tomáš Hanák, the main character of Jesus in Videoclip Xindl X, with is...
As you have come to the cooperation with the two?
We also cooperate with other people, the Czech Kulturszene connected with that we implement many Benefizveranstaltungen organises concerts and...
We are trying to involve those people involved in the projects.
affair has shown that most to cooperate with us and are keen to have fun.
Welchem purpose of the proceeds, organises concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the creation of integrated Bildungszentrums Studeo we already six years, together with the club Tap Jedlička Institute in - work.
The students - regularly Jedlička Institute of teachers, with the help of various leisure activities.
Since the pupils themselves do not have the resources to go before the assistants, we would like to help them in this way.
In the completion of a separate institute Jedlička - building in which we have to work with this project.
At each stage of several groups and the interpreters.
After what criteria you have chosen this?
We wanted to put together a programme, which addresses all the generations, including children.
In Prague Chinaski, for example, to support, with Dan Lesbiens Illustratosphere Bárta The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All you will be further www.kpks.cz on the website.
Are similar 'events have also planned for the future?
In May we come to the Prague Spring, for the first time, and also for this project, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
next year, we also want to be held in New York in the Czech Parliament, and I personally - if we then in the United States, this would also have liked to have a link with interventions in Washington and Chicago.
your Auslandspläne are not just small, you have been so far in Madrid, London, Brussels or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the logistical and organisational travel?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the Gepäckraum transported in wheelchairs, we must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer must haul and luggage...
Nevertheless it has worked to date without its problems, and British Airways ČSA were always prepared to us very well that I have already partly I am sometimes surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Indeed, you have your travel as a comparison, in the various countries with accessibility is, how it is dealing with disabled people, etc.
As you have seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other towns and cities where everything works better than us in Russia, we have just seen that in the East, everything is still in its infancy.
confrontation Prague Moscow is absolutely not accessible, it is still unusually, if someone using a wheelchair, is alone in the city centre.
It is not, of course, that we have a wheelchair users in the lift vorlässt, for example.
terms Fortunately, there are also the clubs try to address the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many issues where we are lagging behind.
The same applies, that is an improvement but it also depends on the situation and the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities are self - employed in the public sphere, museum, use the toilets can move, etc.
It is not just that there is a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in the public arena, we are ahead with the band The Tap Tap the West is a little.
is public respect - and one thing, but only when a change from the ranks of the important things are really start, athletes, artists and actors, to be politicians or lawyers.
So far these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken figures.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, however. If we go back a couple of years, is motivated to you: What has happened in 1998, to set up a bond?
I went to Damals Jedlička as carers, the Institute, where I met many young people who were keen to deal with something.
And since I myself am a Musik-AG Saxofon and musicians and I have established, together with a colleague.
Na, and in time, that is, as our facilitator, Láďa Angelovič, tends to say, somewhat out of control (laughs).
Volume Bekannt but which was only in recent years, or are we not?
It is true that the cooperation with also well - known Sängern we have started to have also helped; actively for us.
We are aware of the fact that it has become rather, and this is not to see the merit, in some sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the EU, we can make our good teachers and high - quality products, and so on.
War, it aims to get it with The Tap Tap?
From the start, I have heard the potential that we can tackle the situation is different.
In the branch of show business today that is often one of the other.
This is logical, on its way with caution, because anything new only after a long time, and will be accepted.
There are only a few things that are truly unique and, I would venture to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the public has often, there is, of course, and this is only natural.
But this sympathy is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned we would regret that.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities, something that is not only to themselves is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
War for this success is also useful that you are strictly a head, as we heard from many people?
If you want to make something good, we should not make any compromises on many things, and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.
This is, I think, but completely normal.
Some come to us with a romantic ideas, and then, when they see that they have twice a week, to undertake stages and spend a lot of time on the enthusiasm, sponsoring concert tours then many of them quickly.
This is how it works but everywhere, in every bond, the serious work and wants to achieve something.
A The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, namely that since 1998?
Just one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. The one can prevent.
Who has the will and the desire to contribute, is always welcome.

Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland has been received with him on the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of this space body zwanzigstes. Poland is the second Member State from the former Eastern bloc countries (to the Czech Republic, that on 12 November 2008 was ESA-Mitglied).
Poland in 1994 close cooperation began with the ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA-Projekten.
The path of Poland in the space of course, start much earlier.
The very before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte are employed in the space sector, but they were not always easy to understand.
I recall, for example, of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory, in which the author of its pioneering ideas presented Kosmonautik included 'to'.
The ideas of the young engineer. 1905) (and the people were, however, and following years, only Šternfeld that Dr Jan Gadomski shown interest in his work has reminded us.
Šternfeld won in 1934 Kosmonautik 'for' entrance to the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten REP-Hirsch announcing.
Dr Jan Gadomski (he later - 1996) has been an important supporter of astronomy and space industry.
In Polish magazines published and hundreds of articles he wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis of internationally recognised contribution to the development of space has been appreciated by, among other things, that a Krater erdabgewandten on the side of the moon after he was appointed.
Right in the year in Poland in 1925 a Eisenbahn-Draisine was built on a Raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the text and the details of this project, unfortunately I do not know.
It is not yet clear whether the rocket the brakes or off the Draisine should be used.
The information that come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 to the Polish infantry started raketenbetriebenen with bullets.
The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
is clear that research for the documents provided to the stage of practical tests was.
The research was interrupted by the invasion, of course, then the German.
In the year of 1937 appeared in the press of the message of originating. Rohoziński draft fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete, and the following year, the work was' Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza 'Leliwa-Krzywoblocky of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
short before the war were all projects to military use of the missile technology by the person who was scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of hard work was its work by the end of the war.
Another article appeared after the war, the aerospace and thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first discussion of this takes place in society in 1954 Novemberausgabe Problemy the magazine, in the four major article devoted to the space industry.
The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time, there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the research of space would have a future.
Right in its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA tried to join up to the 1951 International Federation for space travel, and indeed the PTA has already been in the autumn of 1956 proper Member.
In the following year, was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice - chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
This office he has been holding up to his death in 1959.
Since the 1956 PTA significantly involved in the development of the most successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type RM-1, which was concluded in 1957, the first start was made on 10 October 1958.
The rockets with a maximum altitude of 1 800 metres around 80 cm was long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.
Später an improved version, which was built RM-1A, in 1959, and started in the test flights Błędów - desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket 1.4 m was long and weighing kg approximately 11.5.
Another development should already be in a position to provide genuine scientific work and the missile RM-34 should achieve an altitude of up to 14.5 km for the monitoring of Höhenwinden.
In 1962, however, the further development has been discontinued.
successor of the first type RM the rockets in 1962 to 1965 Meteor-1-Rakete developed.
The rocket, was conceived Zweistufenrakete than 510 cm was their overall length and the take - off weight was 32 500 kg.
From this missile (Meteor-1A three types have been developed, -1 B -1 and C in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport, with 0.4 litres Meteor-1B on 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on 0,62 litre.
The maximum altitude, in all three types of 37 km.
In the years to 1968 in the 1965 Luftfahrtinstitut Meteor-2-Rakete has been developed, the first test flights in 1970 began in October.
Meteor-2 had a take - off weight of 380 kilograms, and was able to implement a 10 kg in a level of around 60 km.
after the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Erwähnenswert is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.
Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms also with Soviet satellite in space, and in 1978, was the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut second.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
In the last week of the Constitutional Court, the law on non - profit - making activities.
This decision was a lively debate in the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue again in a broader perspective.
The liberal - oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world, are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
the principle is that of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, with the unbridled speculation to go hand in hand.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) will Preisspannungen.
Under this concept of a state is, to understand the manufacturers to be tried, by means of import cheaper goods in the economic competition, undercutting 'competition' to a larger market and to increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for the majority of companies or to relocate their production abroad to buy cheap there, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the private sector will be no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for unemployment necessarily caused by the increase in public spending.
This situation is made even worse by the fact that these gentlemen will entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and in the way they have caused to replace overall economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics on this point are superfluous.
The brutal practice of private capital in the individual economies to create a situation in which the governments are forced to enter into competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social and their own people to attract foreign investment into the country.
In other words, the governments will provide for their own people, without any regard for the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing legislation.
it is the aim of these measures, to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
This is the result of economic pressure on a long - term unemployment, on the other, the exclusion of workers' rights.
The outcome is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, there are several years, public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people, are no longer able to feed through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the million.
In the wake of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly cases in which employees are given such a low pay, that the state to increase their income below subsistence level.
One such scandal was also brought to light in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity üdstaaten practically all EU will undoubtedly be in the same situation in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate, (as was the case in the 19th century, or for a pittance on the margins of society and about whom we hope that some private capital will be channelled into the country.
We are naturally, the question of where this capital?
If it is from another EU country, only the poverty moves from one country to another, from the capital or remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media allege that ad nauseam that the state is not with capital to its own economy, and that involved a planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The private sector a narrow - minded insists on its position, that the state lenkend not intervene in the economy.
Then, but the question is whether this is the whole of the State affected in their own selfish interests, or even not the policy and capital.
Here the clear answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all Member States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, of legislation in which practically everything, but nothing is criminally punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a lack of finance private Staatsministerium is responsible, with the industry verflochtene Rechtsunternehmen with the drafting of legislative proposals.
This draft legislative proposals be adopted later in the Bundestag.
All violence is not more popularly announce, such as the western constitutions, but rather by strong financial groups, their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are now quickly end up in a situation in which it describes as Appian in its work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic Cäsars Pompeius' and that 'the state was seen for a long time, and the break - up of the offices have been filled with violence.
Schmiergeld retaliatory, illegal or fraudulent use of advantages in stone and sword.
The corruption has grown, and not the people involved have to buy votes'... 'people with nature bewarben does not consider that the state authorities, as a result of this decline eight months it had already started talking about a consul really...' to 'that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship, and that a strong man should be chosen'... Appian thought but while Pompeius strong man, which will ultimately be Caesar was replaced by the dictatorship lasting democracy.
As it turns out, today's society is based in ancient times, as well as to the reckless preference of their own advantage, without on societal interests.
The private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to recognise and enforce the benefit of the whole of society.
The result is that today, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, not the slightest concern for more in - depth reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we must seek the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state of view, the destruction of these regimes in favour of a liberal democracies break a certain degree, already the next round.
disastrous is special about 140g the fact that today's elites in future the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social catastrophes, we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as they are, we know from the older and more recent history, in total ignorance.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work is no solution, at least no lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition to the Czech Republic will be forced to look for ways to reduce the level of social provision for the population.
This trend is therefore bound.
The only solution - are targeted the reforms to increase the capital of the State in the economy, and increase the influence of citizens to the government of the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.

After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, a huge number of responses.
The one behind Israel and argue with the right to self - defence, while they describe as the Palestinian terrorists help the Palestinians; others argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and call the 'state of Israel.
I would like to take this opportunity to write about who is not in the successive waves of killing is guilty and who is ultimately the victims; today's inhabitants were born of Israel, including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete in the current political situation and have seen the start of the violence.
It is about to open the readers look behind the scenes, who look forward to 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in November in 1917) in the small area of the country in the Middle East, above all, help.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts that are derived from these and other states are from my own understanding of who the group of people or significantly influence the events of modern history.
The history of the human race is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can detect a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious, the question is whether we really are those who, even independently of their action, or whether someone behind their throne, which was its actions to a vorbestimmtes objective.
We must accept that we live in a time in which the wealth of the planet is concentrated in the hands of fewer of individuals, and that this concentration of the currency and the resultant power Lebensspanne not within a generation has been created.
In the astronomical is a very rich families, which we could describe as the head of the moreover (I do not know whether I have on them from someone who is not, however, agree with this - the Rothschilds.
For not it is written on.
understandably enough.
The first (Reuters news agency) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 1990s, the 19th century, in order to prevent the link with their name hochkriminellen action in the context of the consolidation of their powers, the reproduction of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds involved in almost all the central banks in the world and to the countries in which they are not in the central banks are involved, they lead to wars or are these (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, following the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries after the overthrow Ghaddafis only have four with Russia, in the meantime, to the Russian Government has its Central Bank.
Who has always tried to this family, has had to pay with their lives for this.
Abraham Lincoln from refusing to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a Central Bank, started during the civil war, own (in other words, state) notes to 1865 and was murdered in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to produce their own banknotes, and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, the honourable Member Mr McCarthy 1936 Fadden poisoned, having been the Fed sue for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global appetite for power over the years the Rothschilds 1859 - led it to the drafting of a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, one of the 33rd pertaining to the highest level.
The first war was intended to remove the great monarchistischen Staatenwesen of Europe, by the second war in particular should be broken, the British colonial war, and the third is to reduce the world's population to be around 0.5 - 1 billion people - would provide such a number of their benefits and its luxury and would also do not consume so many resources (a), create Universalreligion of ecumenism here is nothing more than the advance) and, finally, for the adoption of the absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top, triggering is a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution - order chao (order from the chaos).
These solutions are wrong and repeating again lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Federal Reserve, so that crises like the one of them was in 1907 not).
Having destroyed it the first Russian trigger the Russian Empire World War by them, the revolution of the Bolsheviks and murder Habsburg Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo was managed
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded Germany's capitulation (for the destruction of the Russian Zarenreiches the war was not necessary), following the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria - Hungary.
In the Second World War on easier to be able to create the bankers, the policy of a latent conflict in Germany, whereas with gigantic Kriegsreparationen; in so doing, they have created a condition of the impoverished masses so that they just the Germans unterjubeln a sufficiently strong leader of the guilty parties notified and offered simple solutions, and the creation of further a factor was the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who play the role of a fifth column should be respected, and also in order to provoke the Kriegsbrand had to.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds took the initiative in setting up the Zionist movement of a sector that is, the creation of a Judenstaates who, as far as possible on the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Sion).
The Balfour declaration, as has already been mentioned, the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terroristische there have been attacks on both sides.
The Second World War, and now whether the international bankers by Hitler the chain, only ran to the difficult to keep at it, is in any case the suffering or whether it was established according to plan, of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded, and in 1948, as well as through Kriegsreparationen against Germany the ground for the Second World War, has been the creation of the State of Israel is the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War.
If it that the Jewish people will unleash war similar in the Second World War, the victims of international bankers can be in the front, Kampflinie, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of the dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how strongly the people of Israel's main supporters and opponents.
Anyone who is and who is guilty of the victims in the conflict between Palestinians and Israeliten only where injustice is wrong in an endless cycle of violence, and the starting point is the greed and their quest for a global power?
We must make a distinction between the peoples of Israel and its leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Netanyahu, the Falke, a typical example is a loyal faschismusanfälligen by bankers, the international leader, who is doing everything it can to create a war with Iran, which is in the light of the membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Pakistan, Russia...) to quickly a global conflict may spread, and which is due to the control of Iran on the only two miles of broad Hormus, about 20% of the world's oil supplies, to destroy the world economy could come from.
In the light of the fact that the words to the 1994 Rockefellers David:' The only thing we need is an over - arching crisis and the people will welcome the new world order.
In its presentation of the new world order is a world of slaves and gentlemen.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten.
A world in which any new - born babies born with a chip implantiert is to submit to the total control of this nature.
'And it is that the small and the large, the rich and the poor, the Free and servants all Malzeichen to give their right hand, or to buy or sell that no one is it because the Malzeichen, namely the name of the animal or the number of its name.
This is their wisdom, who has to consider the number of animal.
Because it is a number of people, and their number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. '
The film Argo: If's worst is to Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob Islamist occupied demonstrating students the US Embassy in Tehran, 52 and diplomats as hostages.
For them to be released, they called for the extradition of the ousted, Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi after the revolution in the United States, which have for decades have fled preserving the Patronat on his regime.
The American Government, there were no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to take on board the Shah, because that confidence massively damaging their allies in other countries.
at it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the setting up of a theocratic regime has led to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco all the violent attempt to retrieve even worse.
The inevitably caught diplomats have been freed, finally, 444 days after negotiations with the Algerian government had been given.
The fate of the hostages show called home to a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer sentiments.
The debacle in Iran has helped significantly to defeat for Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of the history of the United States, which, indeed, a small partial victory.
Unmittelbar before the occupation of the message were six Botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA it, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; we helped them a extravagante story Verdeckung to its true identity, they were travelling with Canadian passports as members of a disguised Filmstabes, the supposedly Drehorte visited the country a Science-Fiction-Film.
combination of Genres
The experts' by 'Exfiltration, Mr Méndez, developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywoods.
That was the cover Article appeared to be credible on this film, in professional journals it press conferences were held and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memory of Mr Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but at the same time a so - called ``Caper Movie ', in other words the history of a successful Husarenstücks such as for example the film Ocean's Eleven.
As in the film Stimmungsebenen - which, on the one hand, from Tehran Dokumentarszenen ikonische Titelsequenz (in the contemporary photographs shown, and also in the Filmfassung the same situation, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - the men in suits Besprechungstisch Amtsfluren on the phone,...
Ben Affleck with this film has been a remarkable start of his career.
From a respectable belächelten actors is a director, and also as an actor it is no longer the objective ironischer comments.
Argo be films third is no easy thrillers (Gone Gone baby, 2007) and the thriller (2010) city without mercy.
it at first, the film Afflecks is not killed in Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere was the place to the characteristics, which the previous films abhoben this film director Hollywoods the standard.
Affleck this sense, however, is also in the Argo, where Tehran played by Canada '.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place, the really Eingangssequenz the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, however, and the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability, that is the case, when they move, the story.
A similar effect Affleck achieved with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong Filmstab in Tehran on a bazaar.
The act of far too many places
The director had to address it not, in fact, that the history of many in the cinema sense, exciting scenes.
With the little it is working very well, but the reality - sometimes nachhilft something which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call, in America or the chase on the runway, are somewhat curious).
The weakness of the Argo is too broad spread of the need, too much to act in too many places to have to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as very charmingly Hollywood-Mitarbeiter, but their characters deserves more space, and they are in the film certainly not alone.
Afflecks film by pulling to lose something. It is a film, which we are pursuing with some interest and goutieren shaping and to a thriller erinnernden Retro-Stil from the 70 years.
enthusiasm he is, however, difficult.
The memory of a certain way of living up to now of history and as proof of this, such as excessive but the ideas of the all - powerful and allwissenden secret services, but it is enough.
directives for the Aufblasen by balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The servers www.bankovnipoplatky.com devoted every year, a survey on the oddest of bank charges, has decided to organise this year, the competition 'Absurdeste regulation, or EU-Werkstatt idea from the'.
'At this notion of the recently put forward by the EU's' plan to introduce a 40% quota of female representation in the management of large European companies, Patrik Nacher said, the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated aberrations, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of Versicherungstarife for men and women.
In the meantime, on life assurance women enjoyed an advantage for the insurance companies, because they constitute a lower risk of objectively.
'Another incredible incursions from the EU-Werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February, with shared Nacher 2013 '.
On the controversial regulations including the mandatory admixture of bioethanol heard on fuels, the result is naturschädigend, the further the ban on mercury thermometers reliable, because it contains only a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes or, the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs have been much more expensive.
erntete criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term ``butter 'or the sales ban on conventional light bulbs.
bananas must be for 14 cm
The EU machine often decide under pressure from this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more Member States are represented, such as the Czech Republic is currently trying to impose Veto-Drohung with the demands of Czech banks.
Lobby-Interessen were also behind this that bananas Handelsklasse the highest in the EU must be for at least 14 cm Krümmungsanomalie 'and not' levels.
The European Commission is defended with the argument that they simply harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would hinder the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables has been watered down by the EU against the opposition of some countries already with the comment that the existing directives are a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey the EU regulation is perhaps the past year, in accordance with balloons the sale to the fact that children under the age of eight Luftballon not without the supervision of an adult aufblasen must.
The EU therefore, in relation to an American study in accordance with balloons leading the cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar reduction already applies to children to 14 years ago on the use of Jahrmarktströten.
there are thoughts Kuriose home
Relativ a directive is also absurd, which affects each European officials in the EU is an official capacity, should say, because of the sensitivity of the issue of the name Macedonia for Greece and must instead use FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Bankovnípoplatky server. com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Toward fair in addition to the above - mentioned absurdities the EU Regulation on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a Member State.
The EU established the Höchstvolumen of food supplies, which is on the day of our accession to the European Union in the field of the Czech Republic are allowed.
exceeded the Czech Republic, for example, then, the volume of which we have threatened Pilzkonserven for a large fine.
The organisers of the survey was also struck by the idea that certain countries receive the money that they have no sea, or should, however, the idea of funding for applications for aid.
These ideas, of course, come not from Brussels, but from Prague.
'We are put at a disadvantage that we do not have a sea.
We will ask for a refund from the EU, the then Minister of Agriculture in the autumn of 2004, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
The argument of the harvest that was very high, and the result of the so - called state camps were overcrowded Interventionseinkäufe.
Since the Czech Republic a further path to sea ports, the EU should have to pay the Palas hundreds of millions of euros in us.
The European Commission, in the Czech Republic, so that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
to funding for applications for funding the communities, the Ministry of Regional Development has, under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), we should specifically is funding for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen in Brussels.
Bizarre EU regulations are the exception.
Regulations are in the Member States is easy to the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU to regulate and effective and development of the whole European Union, according to some experts.
There are serious problem of funding this expert opinion of the EU funds for projects, which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, however, that during the budget negotiations have been forced by individual Member States.
feelings here is also the fact that the Czech Republic as other Member States in Brussels about the right to use specific indications and traditional products have to fight this fight is not always wins.
the Czech Republic had been able to fight for a six - year with Germany and Austria defend the term 'Olomoucké tvarůžky' Inländerrum (Tuzemský), of which we have a tradition of dates back to the 19th century, our producers, however, have to rename the 'in' Tuzemák.
The term 'rum must only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU in the society of the world - famous Gorgonzola, feta cheese and the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens Zwieback of Karlsbad now on, from Pohořelice carp and Třeboň, or even the Saazer hops.
With a EU-Marke as the Pardubicer Lebkuchen can boast or Hořicer roles.
'The people want am I the Republic, but I am just an amateur Okamura'.
Senator, as it is to the idea, for the office of President to stand?
It is not about being Senator or President.
If everything in our country without problems, I would not be standing.
But I can no longer see how the Republic since 20 years, as thieves will be plundered to roam freely, while the tax increase the retirement age and the people.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
If I see something that I did not like to put forward a solution that I try to change this.
And, as I have already, 40 and independent and parteilos, I have no other way of influencing the things as a senator for the office of the President or to stand for election.
In the Senate, and you have managed to put it on the road to the Burg.
You will not back your voters?
I have been told that I take up the fight to Burg after the result of senate.
Später I have this clarified and said that I for the office of President, if I am elected to Senator am going to stand for election.
My aim, however, is not the function. The role is an instrument with which I, my vision a reality.
This I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The difficulty is not only that the people in the pub and in front of the television of the change, but to everyone, starting
The same applies to the media, to deprive the honour and the lie to the freedom of speech, the confused with freedom.
For me, for example, has been said that I would be bribing journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers.
we speak about your vision.
The battle with the Burg you have the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million kroner.
The same applies to you need to change legislation.
When President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.
How do you intend to resolve this problem?
As a citizen, I have argued that the tour guide a free trade, and it is to be implemented.
The problem is the small - minded policy, when someone from the right or the left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and this is just to the population.
The independent Parteiloser I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in the Parliament.
My advantage is that I have no Schubladendenken Parteidogmen me and from any party that what our country is the best we can take.
Can you see itself as a person in the policy more on the left or the right?
The Czech point of view, it seems to me that the left me rather see the people.
For me this Rechts-Links-Denken, though, is quite important.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or on the right wing, and I would like to link the people.
Stets I support public any good solution, even if these KSČM or the ODS and, equally, I will turn against bad ideas.
It is you, when you referred to as the populists.
But you confirm this not by what you have just said?
If you draw up in a company, then a Businessplan Idealziel and you also have a vision.
And do you wish to address this.
One can I describe it as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to operate in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament you remain mere buzzwords.
And so that you are not a long - term policy.
Oder you think that, for example, to the material and criminal liability? you, if you only around long enough, the people will be able to talk about
I have no other option.
politicians, journalists and the public and to try to persuade them to get on our side in order to achieve these objectives.
When President, it is not a problem for me to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties broadcast live on television, the substantive criminal law and to establish liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the Angesprochenen would say if necessary, then, why do they object to this.
A strong personality, which refers to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take your only once the direct election of the President, which has been a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur I am neither a genius; an enlightened.
I am trying to find allies for my views and vision.
With the policy I have only just beginning and try to find that my programme for the support of the majority.
I am trying to make things even more; and if it does not work, then I am again in six years in the private sector.
That sounds as though a little Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not.
I know that I can do nothing for that reason alone, I have talked with several famous people whether they do not wish to stand for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura for example, rejected, however, as a result of the excessive.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová had, the fraud in the trade in a light fuel oil.
I began my candidacy with the requirement that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sechzig% of the electorate are not left to the elections, and who are elected representatives have been mostly the establishment.
The Senate we are only two independent.
The people have chosen Senatszusammensetzung a that such changes will be very difficult to implement.
Even so, I shall fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner.
that you thought about the establishment of the EU's own party?
I think I have not yet, because I have no time to review the past, and that any potential Parteimitglieds also do not have the money for it.
I do not even have money to Präsidentenkampagne; my transparent accounts CZK only 20 000.
You have no money?
Vermögenserklärungen you are talking about, what would you?
My personal fortunes I value of around CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a piece of land, with a value of ECU 25 million, a home for around 10 million to 8 million, a further an art collection, which belongs, which is worth about 10 million, and a Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about a million. And then I have a couple of million to the bank account.
The Ashton Martin was a Kindertraum James Bond - I was always been, as it was in the car galant was to women and, at the same time, against the evil.
Martin a Ashton, you have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
you say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you want to invest in this.
That is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make up about debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have any sponsors, shows that the programme is not a great deal of interest.
And I am not obliged to provide the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign, in essence, be covered by my salary as a senator.
But the Senatorengehalt I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not finance the English schools, the 30 000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I would be able to stand for nothing.
Be so further than entrepreneurs have your work to make a living?
Sagten you not feel that these activities are being cut?
But this is not related to the level of pay.
As promised, I have cut back some of my activities.
However my deputy director of the agencies in the spring.
The people want to see, which saves me as Samaritan of the Republic.
But I must also live by.
An which you have been accustomed as entrepreneurs, monthly income?
Approximately 200 000 and 400, 000, and that is still the case.
As President, I would, however, to my question.
The full discussion can be found in the Samstagsausgabe of Právo.
The MVRDV architects to prove that the real spirit of adventure are not only in mind the example of Spijkenisse and the newly - created Bücherberg - 2 photographs
'I find this building for a ride, there is much futuristic and finally we have to see' interestingly Lisette Verhaig says that a roadside Passantin.
And, Stefan Spermon IT-Techniker in a nearby factories, says: ``However, it is good that the House.
But I do wonder what we need today is a library.
All Internet and electronic books, iPad.
No one is still in a Old-Style-Bibliotheken this?
Spijkenisse besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt a little at the gates of Rotterdam outlandish is record holder.
The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde on the lowest education rates of the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid fact, it was decided a couple of years ago, to education and to contribute as nachzubauen the seven fictitious bridges, which are pretty Euroscheinen, bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the was based.
And so the Stadtväter realised that there be to the statistics, there is only one way to a library ago.
Winy Maas of Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, a master of tollkühnen Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, and often the cynical buildings, with his usual calmness and appeared for the Wettbewerbs-Hearing in 2003, with five books at the arm and an easy snigger in the face.
And while the jury verdutzt still looked at and with our armpits zuckte the impudent stapelte Meuse, its splendid Mitbringsel according to the size of a pyramid aktionistisch well - founded and ended his speech by saying:' love Stadtgemeinde! '
It is, therefore, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so - called Boekenberg.
Nine really do represent years later the EUR 30 million aufgeschüttet Berg is expensive.
He is part of an underground car park Revitalisierungsprojekts to the supermarket, postal services, and a few neighbouring housing and Reihenhäuser with a total of 50 homes.
Bücherberg at the beginning of November, was the second prize awarded the 'Best Library of NL 2012'.
2012: the project has been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award.
That the faceless Kleinstadtretorte is not, to date, have been more to offer than a post - modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white façades we would be inclined to assume a Molkereifabrik, a bit rich to contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long way to book
The first impression: under glass Büchereldorado.
There is a lift the depths of our most mountainous areas through, but the real area and Lesefreuden develop fußläufigen in climbing the topography.
The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright, and the eventual gebrannte Klinkerboden and elegant street lamps clearly speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
Man has already looking for Parkbank, dogs and playing football Mädels and boys.
And all books, books, books.
'which are normally Bücherregale along the façade, and in the centre of a large, dark area, which is usually unpersönlich things and Meuse Winy'.
We have asked and the traditional Raumkonfiguration on the head of the top Lesebereich internally and externally.
The Home of Bücherbergs is skilfully used: In the mid - Office, that, and Internet library Schachclub Haustechnikzentrale environment centre.
A black Bücherregale are special pleasure that, once again, Wandverkleidung Brüstung Stiegengeländer are.
optics, are Haptik and smell.
Even committed architects of Civil Engineers and shake unknown Baustoffs the head.
'We wanted to work here with Recycling-Materialien Trouborst Joop ," declared in the project manager Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we have encountered in a friesländischen holding a fitting one day become waste from agriculture.
For years we have in the Netherlands in greenhouses and in fields as a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies Wurzelunterlage.
That is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The textile, lacking a two Saisonen, it is then Sperrmüll ripe for this.
The library thick records fleece carried the first time - has been squeezed in these quantities are four - inch.
Under pressure from Hitzeeinwirkung and the so - called Landbouwplastic verfärbt (KLP) to a dark, coherent, belastungsfähigen material which smacks of a bissl for new cars and a bissl Sportschuh after.
After 105 stages of the summit is to be reached.
At the end of the almost 500 metres long used will be rewarded in Literaturcafé not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
by atmosphere, but above all for the right Luftfeuchtigkeit Literaturgebirge in.
donations for the new soul
'You would not think so, but this House, despite the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology, Trouborst says.
Geheizt and cooling is with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg Glassturz under the sun shines, sunny days is actually just interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder, the right to be outside glass serve as Beschattung catch and a large proportion of the sun.
The Raumklima is very pleasant.
The rest fully automated Rollos do.
Stefan Spermon, the initial scepticism from the digital sector, already made its way into the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, which even Spijkenisses Boekenberg termed the 'long overdue soul'.
The reason: The opening of all inhabitants of a few weeks ago, was invited to donate a book from his own stocks.
Therefore, for the time being, to be filled the optical gaps are not yet fully - stocked in the library, 70 000 of them - at the moment.
The concept is clear.
The shelves are filled by obenhin.
'There is nothing worse than a half - empty library ', architect Winy Maas says.
'I think that, thanks to our invitation of the inhabitants, has a kind of relationship with this House.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
That MVRDV Königsdisziplin those who have called in the jargon preserving identity.
Spijkenisse Literaturgeschichte has written.
There are young and uneducated they may be.
It is high time a starting point for identity.
Szabo: ``German greater role to play '
Germany has in the vote on the reception of Palestine.
According to expert, Stephen Szabo US-Europ - European relations, Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
firstly: Deutsche Welle indicated at the beginning of the week, as Germany, that it was against the application for observer status for the Palestinians would vote at the United Nations.
Then, however, contain Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done.
Now Germany must be given its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate to its independence, without, however, to be critical of Israel.
Throughout the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstain, as it were, to establish a no - fly zone.
This was achieved by NATO.
Fällt it difficult on important international issues, Germany, to take a clear position?
Yes, it is true.
The reason is that it has just been surrounded and its foreign policy away from a policy of the United States, as it were, to pay a German foreign policy.
Erschwerend that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform have added to this policy.
The Germans, that is, between the lines.
One of them is that they play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I believe that they are making are still in their role, but they are on the way to a more normal 'foreign policy'.
A foreign policy, as they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What means a'n ormal 'foreign policy as from a German point of view?
you shows the willingness to national interests, to adopt positions, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of economic policy, in other words by the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East, is motivated.
Germany to protect economic interests to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and Germany must therefore its interests.
Did they had economic impact on the attitude of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
For Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
And we must be careful, the public, but also the elites, not only in the Arab countries.
This is definitely a role.
But I would not want to attach a great deal of weight, that is not wholly unilateral relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in German considerations.
Where Germany damaged its relations with the United States, by the vote on major decisions such as the vote on Palestine has to contain?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.
And I do not believe that this is a just as in the Libyan question was more dramatic rift.
Maybe einspielen Germany will also ensure that even a certain respect.
Because it signals that it as an international players must be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, have clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there any differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
The American domestic affairs of these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under President Obama has, without a great deal of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation is, of course, the government could not publicly supported that position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion as it always does not seem to be so great.
If you look at the relationship between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama, President Obama is not so enthusiastic about taken by Netanyahu hellauf policy.
Fällt Germany it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans, if it were a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they will not be part of a broader approach and we must instead push things from their own point of view.
The make it is with the euro.
I believe that Germany will in future play a leading role, to urge Europe to a European position.
That is, of course, not just to Germany, because the relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that is the German clear that they play a more independent role.
Sieht even in Germany's role as an important international players - Germany wants to play a leading role at all?
Oder, Germany is still difficult for the leadership role?
Germany is still not being used, it is embarrassing and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If we look at the example of the euro crisis, because each time when Germany, adopts a greater role, various anti-deutsche feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
That is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany However, in a far worse position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and it is not easy.
Well, the influence of the United States is continuously in European policy, the EU does not, for the moment, this vacuum, who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, and a lot of them is an unpleasant unpopular, c' est la vie it!

'protection of trademarks' in China: If Puma Armani and a sudden the Chinese
Armani is a world - renowned, Ralph Polo Lauren.
What Armani Polo is this?
Dahinter a quite officially registered designation in China, but it is nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen.
they work for so long as the actual protection regime not complain about.
And even then it is not clear whether the law.
``It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brand 'in China, Thomas Pattloch says that a lawyer in the sessional services to Schutzrechtsverletzungen Wessing Taylor, which specialises in the Far East.
Every week, a new case, ends up on my desk.
The Nachahmern a few additional letter, so that they can express their brands.
However, will sign Lu-Gucci power instead of simply Prada Prada-Kny it is.
Even German companies are legally copied in this way, for example, the sports goods manufacturers Puma.
Pattloch opens with a raft of registration of the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010 was a Chinese company protect trademarks, a somewhat Zegna DF Puma, which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used.
The fact that the Chinese are known champion in copying and the injured intellectual property.
In the big cities are mehrstöckige department, the almost exclusively to sell counterfeiting.
Pattlochs cases but are different: On behalf of his client, however, it is the case that Chinese companies are quite officially received the right to use a term which is already protected, elsewhere.
The Chinese call this' Mingpai bang ', a Beifahrermarke.
That word is' Dakuan bang '.
It is women who are rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are well aware of any blame
'That is, we must combat geschäftsschädigend Pattloch'.
``watered down, will mark the Alleinstellung disappear, the 'Imageschaden is enormous.
The financial losses Prozesskosten of the industries concerned and which run into millions, especially where expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
After the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA China is with a budget of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest - growing.
However, the dubious entries Löschungen Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Until the procedure to nine years is dragging on, with an uncertain end.
Pattloch reporting of cases in which the court complaints about the effort, because the name 'after' reality is the long term.
If the plaintiff have the misfortune of having to pay, Plagiator even money, because its brand Pattloch violated in China.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Berühmte cases also affect graphic elements.
Daimler lost in 2009 a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, that businesses, which recently took the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore use until now, a symbol which resembles Mercedes-Stern.
The Volvo-K äufer Geely one originally used blau-wei emissions logo of BMW, reminded us, the dispute was resolved Geely, had to change it.
The Modehersteller Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would ensure the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are well aware of any blame.
The case to CTMO in Beijing is true that there are low 2010 staff and have better facilities were bottlenecks.
Last year it was returned from the 'but' emergency situation in business to normality.
However the stock is unbearbeiteter appeals fell by 22%.
Almost 57.000 such cases we have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
yet still in office 81.500 objections are awaiting execution.
However much it costs to tackle
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, 1.4 million more than the CTMO requests received on protection of trademarks, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China and for the tenth time, the list of consecutive Neuanmeldungen in the world, to quote the authority.
This applies also to the stock of all the existing brands, 5.5 million as a whole.
1.8 billion in 2011 are yuan charges have been taken.
Vereinfacht which means that any notification 1280 yuan and the average cost of EUR 160.
However, as a cost to the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.
For more than seven years ago, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to ensure that its illegal production Kraftfahrzeugteile imitation has been exposed.
However, the more the Chinese rights secured to the brand Freudenberg.
You have failed to do that in Germany, because family names, could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler says, the chairman of the management of Chemical Freudenberg Specialities in Munich.
The case was CTMO back the appeal of the Munich.
Over the next two bodies, while Freudenberg received, but fighting Prozessgegner further until today.
We must be extremely careful
Now the issue is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says:' The procedure is extremely expensive and will cost us a great deal of time, money and nerves'.
The internal costs are difficult to quantify, which leaves Firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files, to provide proof.
Before Freudenberg five years on the other side of the House was in vain for a ``high Eurobetrag 'Decision on the resolution.
'Kultura we see how far it is worth us Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threatening to Europe.
Then, if there are unprotected imitators secure.
There was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany for the textile and leather shoes Freudenberg for.
This area of business of the company, but he has been able to prevent the registration.
'You must be careful not to say extremely Wentzler'.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch German companies to do business with China, to be very careful.
It is not enough in itself to international trademark rights, instead of leaving the foreigners or 'everything should somehow is worth protecting, including in China ', as Wentzler says.
Sonst this can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, the case: Freudenberg last act of his Markendramas is, then we should pay the licence fees for the other party's own behalf, Wentzler.
Oder we will be pushed out of the market in the sector in question.
AIDS Day, sing Stampfen help:
The Heidelberg the chorus probt Imbongi and in Swaziland Aidswaisen be happy about it.
The history of a link, which is far more than 8733 eradicates kilometres.

It is Monday evening, the products of the Institute Musikraum psychology in Heidelberg the chorus probt Imbongi a new.
An the fifty Sängerinnen and singers reached between 23 and 69 years old, until the householder Humangenetikerin.
'Mr Om' Obani 'is not a simple way, every Chorstimme has a different text, and this in a foreign language: Zulu that the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and, in parts, Swaziland have spoken.

Weltweit, there are around 34 million people are HIV - infected Unaids the estimates, the programme of the United Nations to Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 Aidswaisen live.
More than 40% of the population are HIV - positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen Esitjeni in the village of the club has received wisdom Voices for Africa in Germany.
70 of them are attending secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, we can take a sponsor.

For almost ten years, the chorus of songs a foreign language, and in this way, and to bring them back to where they originally come from: in the southern Africa.
Because the crow flies 733 8 kilometres of Heidelberg, Swaziland, in the north - west of the UK, there are the village Esitjeni by the Stimmgewalt of the German Chores depends.
Vierzig% are infected
Approximately 2000 people there, some still in simple Lehm Strohhütten - and a large number of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because these are HIV.
In Esitjeni a small foretaste of what is quite Swaziland: high HIV-Infektionsrate, according to UNICEF lowest life expectancy in the world.
restrictions of male Vorhaut, to minimise the risks of contamination exponentially half, it will not be accepted by the population.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland - virus of the deficiencies in the middle, with thirty is not uncommon to die.
In a joint Afrika-Reise in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered in the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children in the streets, which not only a lack of parental responsibility, but simply to all: food, clothing, education.
Without education in a poor country certainly no chance.
beginning it was the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros per year to send to school and a child to give him a warm meals day.
However, a year later, the chorus of the club founded ,' Voices for Africa, the Greens in the almost professional Aids-Waisen Esitjeni.
facts to sexually transmitted infections
sexually - transmitted diseases are the most important?
Regarding the TSIs, bacteria Syphilis chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Häufige viral STI Pappilomaviren Humane are HIV or hepatitis Herpes genitalis.
Filzläuse Krätze and among the parasite STI.
Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?
Syphilis Tripper come and, above all, in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch-Institut from it is that at least four out of five of all in Germany by Syphilis-F reported cases of sexual contact between men.
In the adults are heterosexual Chlamydien-Infektionen Trichomonaden, fungal Candidose () Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren major sexually - transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV, heterosexual adults is comparatively small - but here: 20% of new HIV infections legislate in this group.
Under Chlamydien-Infektionen young people to become much more than other groups.
After European surveys affect infections, three quarters of all young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years.
Humane Pappilomaviren Hierzulande moreover, often for young people.
As the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually - transmitted diseases are meldepflichtig.
The number of Syphilis-Infektionen has doubled the Robert-Koch-Institut 1697 of diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases more than the year 2011.
The number of new HIV infections is back in 2007.
2011, there were around 2 700 cases.
This is about a tenth of less than in the previous year.
What symptoms out highlight a Geschlechtskrankheit?
The infectious diseases ulcers Genitalbereich, the complaints to the Urinieren, a product, or Unterbauchschmerzen and Bläschen Warzen.
Oft they do not, however, cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect themselves?
condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but not a 100% guarantee.
Because of the virus can be passed on by sexually - transmitted diseases, by just Schmierinfektionen and close.
Therefore the experts recommend Sexpartnern frequently, in particular, regular checks.
morning most TSIs have diagnosed and cured can be avoided.
By Patenschaften, donations and not least the Gagen to the choir ersingt throughout Germany, a great deal together.
``Overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros after Esitjeni, Annette Lennartz says that the chairman of the associations.
The village Dlamini Zodwa itself, a self - confident and durchsetzungsstarke women, the money from Germany.
you concerned about the orphans unterkommen good one, for example the Grandmothers.
The Gogos, as it is called, to the old women Zulu are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have been up to 14 orphans to give them a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms on every day in school classrooms.
Who has no one else, comes into Schutzhaus Khanyisile to a single woman who is paid for by the club, as well as the two cooks, every day the cook for more than 200 hungry children.
Voices also called 'for Africa has built a Nähschule, and two Hühnerhäuser together with the American health arrangements PSI that many have an HIV test in order in the village.
This is not a matter of course, because it appears that the disease is also in the whole of the country, but they would be dead.
The King with 14 wives
'AIDS is absolutely taboo, Annette Lennartz says that' because it has to do with sexual orientation '.
Eigentlich strange in a country where the King has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch King Mswati III. of sub - Saharan Africa is known for its excessive lifestyle.
polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things it is also due to the state - sanctioned way of life that the HIV in the last few decades has spread so quickly.
However, the many migrant workers, which bear the virus through the country.
if there were any corner Kostenlose of condoms, Annette Lennartz says, ``but are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh '.
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the travel Imbongi-Chor every two or three years, together with the southern Africa nostalgia, songs and is full of fighting spirit of optimism and confidence, black, know of many on the southern bit of the black continent from a period of apartheid.
A bus full of great who sing songs of language - brings so much credit not only mood and rejoicing, but some tears has also been some abgetrotzt grimmigen border guards.
The visit will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singer visit their godchildren.
Although it is not the small village of reference in the valley, the Ezulweni-Flusses it is more than well - known.
'n't Esitjeni, that is to say the people there.
And when you return the crow flies 8733 kilometres in Heidelberg, stampfenden Sängern in the Proberaum Bergheimer on the roads, then - as we see it.
NASA discovered on the ice Messenger Merkur:
The Messenger is has found evidence that the planet is Merkur ice.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 - metre thick.
The agency NASA US-Raumfahrtbeh has shown the existence of ice Merkur on the planet.

The Messenger is found evidence that it constantly in the region of the world, in the shadow of the ice sheet is.

The water was probably of comets or perhaps even in the asteroid Merkur are taken.

Our insight into space: The main Teleskope
The Teleskop to be invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before it began, Galileo Galilei Sternenbeobachtung to a year later.
Seitdem the mirror the optical Teleskope increasing and the insight that they provide, ever deeper.
30 years of 1947, in 1975 was the Hale-Teleskop Palomar-Observatorium near San Diego the biggest Fernrohr the world.
Der Spiegel, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Telescope Binocular is.
It is right to look into space of two mirror, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The plumbing of Gran Telescopio supporting Kanareninsel of La Palma is the mirror - alone is 10.4 metres in diameter.
Der Spiegel of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save costs.
Even so, it achieved a diameter of some 11 000 metres.
The Teleskop is laid down - detriment of the favourable construction, and in his Höhenwinkel in its flexibility.
Even the Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas in Höhenwinkel is fixed.
His characteristic: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This approach is, despite a comparatively low Spiegeldurchmesser - to the world's largest Spiegelteleskope.

Everything is green saftig and you would think that it would be in the Black Forest.
However, it is the lowest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here the Caucasian Talyschen lives of the population, which is not much aware, except that it is perfect and Persian Aserisch and long lasting.

The small city flaunts wuchtig too greedy architecture from Soviet times, so I do not want the malerische Berglandschaft.
tourists in Europe will be too onerous hardly here, that is the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku.
For the 323 kilometres of eight hours is needed, because the road is only einspurig.
The incredible wealth of the country's oil resources in the Caspian Sea, it is still not arrived here in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that the tourist attraction Lerik has potential.
'Baku was made in May with the famous Eurovision-Song-Festival and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world ', Fatulayeva says.
you is the director of the museum of performance, the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area more than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black and white picture.
That is my grandfather, he has been 120 years of age.
In the age of 136 years but still a child
However, the shepherd is controversial Star Şirali Müslümov to the museum of 168 years old.
A Geburtsurkunde however, there is not.
And in view of the oldest - documented, 122 years old, was Müslümovs age is extremely dubious.
'1805 when he was here in the region, he was born in 1973 Fatulayeva'.
The man was married and had three times 23 children, aged 136 years have shown a daughter to it.
Has Şirali Müslümov his age is due in a few decades?
But also Altersforscher Rembrandt Scholz, on Max-Planck-Institut in Rostock has, from the very elderly in Central Asia.
'Auffallend hochaltrige there are many people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza-Tal in Pakistan' Scholz says that 'in Sardinia lots of very old men live'.
Due to a lack of documentation, however, is no scientific evidence on the basis of age, as there were missing.
Every day becherweise geschmolzene butter
, however, is the fact that the people of the region around Lerik a remarkably often biblisches age.
For the moment, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
Why is it so many Hochbetagte live in the South?
The aserische tour guide Mugimzadeh Farid declared with the special genes, the Talyschen.
Museumsdirektorin Fatulayeva against it believes that it is in the eating.
However, that it should be the stuff of kalorienreiche Talyschen as healthy meat, bread and milk products and, above all, and many of whom is every day from a nutritional point of view also geschmolzene drink a glass of butter, is not plausible.
Oder, for it is the original way of life, the young, the people? In Cengemiran, a tiny, district of the city, Rubaba Lerik Mirzayeva lives.

In particular, it is preparing the guests of tea in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-Gl äsern being served.
Mirzayevas white teeth are in perfect Reih and link them under their headscarves is dunkelblonde long Zöpfe, which reveals her son to be proud of.
I voted with my hair and milk from me, so they were never and kept their colour.

The propaganda sounds from the mouths of an old woman.
However, the cult of the will of the nation, does the nation as a dictator his country, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
In 2003, it was in power, then his son, Ilham the lead in this.
Immerhin there is no emergency situation in Azerbaijan.
Mirzayeva receive a monthly pension than 230 Manat (approximately the same amount in euro), for our conditions, an amount which they can live.
And perhaps Mirzayevas ergrauter son has also been right: ``The Old enjoy in our culture '.
I live in the middle of the extended family carers, loved and are happy.

The Egyptian President with emotion years.
We must create the transition.
'And that it is able, under my responsibility, before the people and to God in the state television service ', he said.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all for the Christian Coptic Christians, Muslims and the Liberals, enlightened Säkularen.
They all, has so far been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
fear of a theocracy, there remain the Nile of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, Mohammed Mursi said almost entschuldigend temporarily extended, and reduced the powers of the constitutional court, its competences in order to save the revolution '.
However, the saving of 61-j - year - old engineer a doctorate the American University of Südkalifornien, really wants to the Egyptians, the world is not very much.
Should the judiciary to be removed?
In fact, Article 234 which are dominated by the Islamist 100-k - strong Constituent Assembly as a night, 15-st Parforceritt - have been pushed through some worrying.
As in previous constitutions, even, as is stated in the draft, the case - law in the form of 'principles of Islamic law'.
However, what does' principles'?
It was and is subject to interpretation and it is to be feared that they use the woolly formulation and the associated legal scope for a strict interpretation of the Sharia.
That suggests hinzugeführter at least a new article, the Sharia law in all these matters, will consult with the Al-Ashar-Universit, Islamic to the most important institution of the country with a great deal of power in the whole of the Sunni Islam.
This must not, however, it could mean that the legislation should have been overseeing the clergy, which de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation contained in
We should continue to maintain a problem: The civilian military jurisdiction.
This courts, while Mubarak's government to the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11 000 civilians in Militärhaft.
The state should also, as it stands, the draft 'protection' and 'promote the true nature of the Egyptian family' their morals and its values.
This is legally so unclear that state institutions, with the help of this article control even the content of cinema and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
No Article, moreover, explicitly states, the equality of men and women.
This is another to insult and the Prophet Mohammed and its envoy to slander.
What, however, is an insult to how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Just dubious is the wording of the 'insult to the people' is banned.
Reicht as a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer.
interpretation, as so much in the draft, the Mursi to sign and very soon after the words' the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented.
'The revolution has returned'
The opposition is taking shape, for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual consensus on Friday in Cairo in Tahrir Square and promised to bring the Charter, even before they can enter into force.
'The revolution has returned and that we will win' Hamdin Sabbahi Drittplatzierter said, the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and Mohamed El Baradei's Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency has said, the draft Constitution was one 'on the scrapheap of history'.
Via Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter Mursis supporters, it is the result of a military coup against the 'democracy'.
'When he devoted to the referendum, we will go to his palace and the opposition, said that' Said Yasser.
'We are still not tire of the blood of our brothers is not punished, the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And a number of judges in that referendum announced not to want to monitor it, and this would be invalid.
'The Koran is our constitution'
The well - organised blies Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, but not as a demonstration in Tahrir Square, but after a Massengebet Nilufer on the other, the Cairo university.
Many veiled Salafisten and supporters of the women involved, and said: ``The people calls for the application of God's law. '
you called for by Mursi Säubere:' the country, and several occasions: ``The Koran is our constitution '.
A battle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square in which all started, would have created conditions resembling civil war.
The Mursis risk supporters were clearly not.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution would be said loud and clear.
Now is the time to the ballot box, the people to decide the direction of the country should be.
A majority of the Islamists is safe.
The word 'rights' is not even
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about the Constitution, the upsurge in fact have until February and to involve all the social forces.
The 48 years of human rights lawyer and leader of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood under Mubarak, as they are in prison or in the courts.
Not because it would share their belief, but because of human rights are indivisible.
This was beaten and arrested and sentenced.
'And now, human rights is not even in the new Constitution, he complains in talks with the' world 'on Sunday.
Mursi Machtausweitung to all three powers in the state of the lawyer can act.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of play and Egypt will result in a new dictatorship.
Instead of having to 'strengthen the civil society, the President to do it de facto override Saeda'.
However, without a functioning democracy, civil society organisations.
Saeda feel abandoned by the international community, which considers the ideological Richtungskampf the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be apparent.

Rakfisk from Norway: Is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest standard of living - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
If the secret of the success of the country to do with the local appetite for rather nasty smelling fish?
We note a selection überreifer cheese.
We are in the midst of a crowd platziere they are dirtier feuchter Sportkleidung.
And they leave that a week.
That is roughly we must envisage nasenbetäubenden the smell of Rakfisk, one of the major be delicacies Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.
There are here, snow spectacular landscapes and this persistent smell in the air, which does not simply disappear.
Rakfisk with salt bestreute trout, depending on how we would like - stinkend its fish up to a year in water will ferments.
If in Norway the darkness of the country and the Norwegians are a weather will become colder Fagernes, now, that this is really very's speciality.
'You are eating raw and carries it down with a glass of Aquavit' Havard Halvarsen says, which is actually in the local fire station is working, but, as so - called 'Rakfisk-General' is also organising the festival.
If people consume around us Fischwürfel to small and large quantities of alcohol.
'Mansche people Aquavit the more as the Rakfisk Havard says'.
The spirit can replace the smell.
In some Häppchen cost.
If we are to get the Rakfisk Nasennähe avoids, in that it is not a bad thing, for example, how sushi has a rather lengthy bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a quite different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no thing and fish in the autumn in luftdichten Salzwasserfässern was watered.
The deepest winters he has been removed and then after a long, under fermentation using alcohol consumed gedämpften - end.
On a generation of thousands of Norway in search of work were forced to leave their country and from wanderten mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a prosperous labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, it was not so long ago was much richer as Norway, are immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential if strict riechender part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which it is possible to buy.
But here, of course, everything is expensive - a little glass of beer or a sandwich  Euro impressive 10 costs.
Norway, it is not often in the world press, and most people there do not seem to be upset.
Here we have to call it hates, Anders Breivik - racist extreme right of those who, in the last year of the 77 shot men, women and children.
Stattdessen it relates only to the 'incident of 22  Juli'.
Norwegian do find it difficult to accept that someone in their peaceful country to such brutal murders is capable.
has Hauptverantwortlich for today's wealth of Norway the early 1970s, the growth of the biggest oil and Gasindustrien the world.
``But oil is not the only reason why we are so well off 'Anna says that our waitresses, distributed and round - trays reifem with Rakfisk with its long and the hair blonde stechend blue eyes represents the Nordic model.
We are one - as they say - the people.
Your English is just as the measures which most people here.
We are not very angeberisch Prahlerei, we do not like.
Norway is handled very carefully, with its oil wealth, a large part of the Branchenerträge for the benefit of future generations will be invested in a special fund.
As in all the years leading up to the global economic crisis, with money that they had not even in its pocket stones, Norway has firmly closed.
'As long as we in the winter of ski everywhere and in the summer, we are happy to be able to go' Anna says.
'and' eat Rakfisk, of course, it also adds unbeschwertem with laughter.
I am pleased to note the snow and for another court - of Rakfisk I have enough.
That is in any case a Elch-Burger is something quite different. The huge enjoy meat.
But in the evening of Stinkefisch is once again on our menu.
The hotel, where I logiere is one of several Veranstaltungsorten, to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner the guests for the best, or perhaps the most challenging Geruchssinne - fish can vote.
There is a Live-TV-Schaltung of a bird Showmaster there were, which is surrounded by Rakfisk tables.
The spectacle is like the Eurovision Song Contest.
What than those of their 'as you were up in the mountains, for the best fish Thor-J?'
'There are our points Havard'.
Man and laughing klatscht.
A man of his seat, is perhaps overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict cloud of all the fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
As Mr Pena Nieto Mexico next President, at the start of his term of office and analysed by the BBC Grant the challenges ahead of it leaving everything and mixed feelings of its people.
Aktuell transport is particularly bad in Mexico City.
Even for better days ago, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday was created as a ring of steel, the absperrt and several important routes in the capital is causing havoc on the roads.
The aim, however, it was not to disrupt commuters are on their way to work, but to stop demonstrators, to achieve this Parliament.
On Saturday Präsidentenbinde of Mexico and the new President will receive Enrique Pena Nieto take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderons Mexico is economically has to prove its worth, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years, has already led to 60 000 lives.
'My government is strongly committed to the violence, to reduce Pena Nieto stated earlier this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.
I intend to propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before it on an equal footing with the US President, was Pena Nieto Mexico as Governor of his\/her own Member State.
In this densely populated, rambling part of the country's capital city, opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote village Bravo del Valle, for example, like to remind you of it.
inhabitants of Urlaubsorts to write to him the development of tourism and the building of the infrastructure.
In order to achieve the city, you can run on a motorway building Nieto Pena and which would be a great improvement on the fragile, holprigen roads, it was again.
badges with its name are outside of a modern Sportzentrums and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
'We expect him' real and lasting change his friend and political ally, as Mr Gabriel Olvera Kongressabgeordneter for the party Pena Nietos the Institutional Revolutionary Party, is working.
Especially, as regards the safety and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change, there is an urgent need in our country.
After years of power 81 of the Institutional Revolutionary Party has been replaced by Vicente Fox in the year 2000.
The Olvera - is that the party after 12 years of Los Pinos Präsidentenpalasts outside the great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, it rejected.
He is a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, it was also someone who can hear.
But, on the other side of the Heads of State, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast could be paved roads of the brilliant del Valle not growing.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of itself.
And the problems in the municipality of urban nature are crucial.
Earlier this year, the military was involved in the neighbourhoods in order to combat drug gangs operating, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
At a wasteland spots in the vicinity of a large landfill in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind.
During the period of the State Governor Pena Nieto - Mexico over 1, 000 women were murdered a statistic, which exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez for their violence and the killing of innocent women is well known.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that it is not appropriate to address the problem of the murders of women during his term of office.
However, in the worst case, its government have closed their eyes to the problem.
In a Betonbau, typical of the run - down quarter Irinea Buendia is struggling with tears, as it shows me photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events Mariana, 2010, has committed suicide.
However, their family believes that it was murdered by their partners.
'When I arrived in their home, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed "Senora Buendia.
There were signs that it was beaten and Leichenstarre, which had already begun.
During her mother, their history of the wall, has told us a picture of Mariana to us. It is appropriate, in addition to a cross, which bears a single word: justice.
However, it is precisely this, the family, we have until now prevented from it.
The authorities have with me when I was a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin Nörglerin that.
you want is to accept their verdict simple and shuts up.
'But that is not possible, if there were so many flaws and shortcomings, it says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday he receives Präsidentenbinde which will also have a great responsibility.
Mexican tens of thousands of families have been learned in the last six years of violent crime, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to this problem.
'I hope, as President, it is true, as he was governor, which says' PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle's del well done.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.

My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave because of the lack of opportunities, Mexico
Mexicans have a tendency to blame the immigrants, they call them difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent visit to Mexico City I had only just cuts through the hall and the passport was reached, a dilemma in me.
signs referred to two queues: 'A 'for' Mexicanos Mexicans "), the other for 'Extranjeros ' (' aliens").
I was there, a few seconds, to which I should like to go.
I grew up in Zentralkalifornien and all my life was called 'the Mexicans ."
An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston 'or' Irish my friends in New York 'Italian'.
I decided Später Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch 'for'.
But that Mexico has been here.
And in the country of my grandfather, there was no need for Kürzeln or Bindestrichen.
I was simply Americans.
I am at least in Spanish, good enough for me to say in this language two ends in an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers my American emphasis, and I will not go well.
So, I took my American passport and undertook in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought at the moment, this week, as the future President of Mexico Nieto Pena Enrique went to the White House in order to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda all those issues which were expected to take if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy, you are talking about is a reason for this is that today, with a high probability of Mexicans, in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States.
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block for example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to Mexico, the war against the drug cartels, even if he has any details in this respect.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full Ressentiment.
The Americans are most probably never been a single idea that the United States in 1848 invaded in Mexico and have forced the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun to leave them to more than half of their territory.
But for the Mexicans in centuries in minutes, and not to have to think back to this event.
As soon as a US-Regierungsbeamter is therefore only one hears mildeste criticism of Mexico, in the Mexican press and the elites of the country, complaints, as the Americans are bringing pressure to bear on the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children themselves Montezumas on the war - path.
And yet the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans in the United States.
desire to talk about sentiments?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people, for the country, and offers opportunities for the other, it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas example, in Denver, or San Antonio live, is that of a point in our family tree, a person may be a parent or Großelternteil was necessary, and no chance in Mexico towards auswanderte north.
And, in the majority of cases, this person was a profile - brown - skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the offspring of these people, and our allegiance to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we now live, perhaps, the American dream, that it does not have good jobs, the Mexican. American the dream which have visited and good schools we live, we must never lose sight of the fact, is.
Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is certainly the United States.
I also we are aware that not many Members may the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
you see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not sufficiently mexikanisch.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico not strong enough.
your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If not, our families in Mexico, they would not have had failed.
And then we would see us now caught behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child einwanderte legally in the United States, I am reminded that, between Mexicans and Mexican Americans are tension because Mexicans have a clearer picture of what they are, and who Mexican Americans, they take.
While they American citizen, it is, as part of the two countries.
However, many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither the one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican bond lot Tigres del Norte region, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but it is not rooted in.
In Mexico we be seen as the Americans.
And in the United States we be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something more complicated this relationship: Some Mexican leaders Bildungsbürgertums wish to include and parts of their links to the diaspora.
you want to use as a provisional Mexican Americans' ambassador 'for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, and put pressure on as great a visit to the country's political leadership to intensify its relations with Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Unfortunately, feelings of many injured.
And in view of the unfair distribution of incomes, the extensive corruption and Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I fear that these Amigos, it alone.
That is fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are not yet ready to the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, a resentment, to grant it must also accept, that some of the Mexican Americans with their family members, as it was not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are 'Mexicans, as I thought'.
old battles, new Middle East
The cease - fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be unexpected cornerstone for peace
Will it ever be lasting peace between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to nip in the bud any such hope.
Amidst the usual blame countless buildings - were killed in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis, for the first time and rockets from Gaza are taken in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while the Israelis and the Palestinians in their historic conflict in the Middle East are changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new situation, uncertain, and whether or not they want it Palestinians and Israelis have been part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to believe that the situation could be at the end of it.
A war will be lost, not yet been won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation as anything else would seem to be appropriate.
Even if the on the 21  November week's battles have strengthened the cease - fire agreed Hartgesottenen continues to both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have fostered by the Israelis, although his group had even large losses.
Although several of the Hamas leader killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in a desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet have not succeeded in Israel are packed up to now, to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas in the West Bank, which is a rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled.
And the Hamas leader could come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side.
However, such as Islamists in the Arab world, of influence have won, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side.
The Turkey, a regional power wiedererstarkende, in the past, as Israel's closest ally, Muslim was taken to the Hamas - party like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Jubelnde Hamas-Anh Gong believe that by Israel, Lebanon in the Islamic north Crescent, is where the militant Hizbollah has the power, Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren - style Stürzung Bashir Assad, might stand up to Jordan, where Hamas-Verb ündete the King.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - einwohnerstärksten and by far the principal Arab country - from the southern flank of Israel has changed in the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the secular tyrant up to his fall 30 years 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast to the brotherhood verschwägert is with the Hamas and its leaders Volksansichten more dependent.
In future, the Hamas diplomatic negotiations could prove to be an actor, even by Israel and the United States could not be squeezed out.
The Israeli hardliners on the other hand, I consider the opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no risk Militärisch seen more.
The Israeli missile defence system, ``Iron Dome 'has been able to prove its worth and many of the rockets have been destroyed.
Zumindest a period of calm and Israel will be able to go to sleep.
The diplomatic firmly believe that the United States remain steadfast in its position. Many European countries have made responsible for the latest Gewalteskalationen Hamas.
Israel is good to have in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process has, to a large extent.
Although rockets from Gaza killed since 2004, around 30 Israelis, the country is, have remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the Sperranlagen in the West Bank and in the main part of a possible hineinverlaufen Palestinian State. This the Jewish settlements, which is to protect a breach of international law have been declared, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu. His Likud is a good ally, in the run - up to the elections on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman, with a still kämpferischeren group.
Why do these hinterlistigen Palestinians to nanny and also leave a State?
If they do, in fact, the control of the West Bank, they would not have faces as well as their comrades - in - arms in Gaza also missiles?
No, it is better to keep it short and to punish the wall in check, you should dare to raise your heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to guarantee the Arab spring. However, they could be stopped.
Even if the Islamists, who are sitting now on they will be in place in Egypt and in other countries with difficulties in the country's own power, have very little left over for Israel,
The Verteidigungsetat of Israel is greater than with its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the restoration of their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi zusammentat with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a ceasefire, and perhaps to represent the beginning of a new era, and could be a promising sign -
Even Israelis should think long - term.
Throughout the rest of the Arab world is making democratisation timid steps in the direction of the Palestinians' right to self - determination - continue to be deprived of their, which is undoubtedly a powder keg, one day in the Israeli - occupied territories will explode, just as this week, there was an explosion in a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only get worse.
Blutige missions for the eradication of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly calling for its diplomatic over the years.
Both sides need a boost from outside
The answer is, those of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: two states, in which Israel for security purposes are waived areas.
The small, in the near future - hope that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now working with Turkey and Qatar the supply of arms in the Gaza Strip is better placed than ever before, to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and Jerusalem.
Arab nations outside the Hamas and Fatah should move to an agreement.
That more is done for the creation of a Palestinian State, as with the forthcoming proposal on UN-Beobachterstatus.
Even Obama to play its part, to persuade Israel to negotiations.
During his first term he missed the presentation of his own peace plan.
Weit in white House, it seems, it would be equally unwilling to participate in it.
However, this is a deplorable, short - term perspective.
The United States have a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws in force for uniform Zigarettenverpackungen
caring and health warnings on packets, neutral green body to which all are equal where brands
The world's first international laws for single cigarette and Australia Tabakverpackungen entered into in force. This Markenlogos and colours, replaced by neutral olivgrüne lid, moreover, with the dramatic images are the sick and body parts: '1 shot by cigarette smoke are sick infants and children.
Of the various health warnings and images from next Saturday, apart from the only difference is between the packages in the small print in the small print, are identical.
That Australia is leading the world's most stringent rules for Tabakverpackungen.
The Australian Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamouröse picture of tobacco consumption.
Let the government from is based on studies have shown that people who, with 26 have not yet started, with 99% probability, will no longer be starting to smoke.
'You can already see in children, young age that they are trying to understand the message, to apply the tobacco companies with their Markenbild Bundesgesundheitsministerin Tanya Plibersek, you quoted the studies have shown that children, for example, to associate the crown of a logo with the idea of Princess.
Although Australia and one of the lowest Raucherquoten the world only minor changes to the profits of the multinationals, will consider other countries already have similar steps.
The tobacco lobby hard fought against the law.
However, it has been said with the laws of encouraging Schwarzmarkthandel to cheaper cigarettes and easily accessible.
Scott McIntyre says:' The legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences of 'British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will provide much greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Other, however, say that the laws have given their business.
to see by Sandra Ha Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, that the demand for Zigarettenetuis Silikondeckeln and to cover the intolerable packaging is increased enormously, since the corporations British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco, Britain's Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago, on top of the Australian Court, with its protest against the laws failed.
Zico have to be sold at 6 000 units Großhandelsgeschäfte waiting for new resources.
For us this is a good deal.
the catch, according to the experts, is the popularity social media in the section to which the plan.
A number of australischer legislation, has banned from the tobacco companies TV-Werbung, it prohibits Sportsponsoren them, as the majority of businesses and forced to stop shops cigarettes. Now the tobacco advertising on the Internet is changed.
The Australian Government has banned by local companies and Internet pages, however, has no influence on international sides.
'Who marketed, and tobacco has only a small area, in order to promote their products to the Internet is not' Becky Freeman says, a researcher in the health sector in the University of the Sydney Olympics.
The social media, Facebook and Twitter and YouTube Freeman has established an increase in Erfahrungsberichten to trade marks that of 'ordinary people'.
We must ask the question: Is it just a private individual, the great favours Marlboro-Zigaretten will take place, even that they include a video - or has a Marketing-Agentur to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of marketing point of the new laws to concentrate.
you has even gone so far, the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to pay for the new rules to those who complain about the World Trade Organisation on unfair Handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries has increased trade with Australia.
A WTO ruling is expected for mid -2013.
Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries which consider similar Verpackungsgesetze.
Canada was the first country that would include photographic warnings required.
Mittlerweile these were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Härtere laws be considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many of the Australian smoker does not show itself.
The pictures not me.
I simply ignoring them.
'We are simply a bad way and takes away the box, Victor says' El Hage, when buying a packet of Mundtumor is a photograph with a copy.
Frankly speaking, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girls.
James Yu operators' King of the aims of the Pack 'in the inner city of the Sydney Olympics, says that the uniform packaging have stacking shelves it more difficult.
'I have, however, taken a consignment einzusortieren to now, I have no need of four' Yu says.
'The government could have simply to ban all cigarettes, then we would have said' OK, that's was that we pull 'it is also clearly furious.
In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is all very well to be bored
I spent Thanksgiving This unexpected five hours, and the airport as our aircraft operated by mechanical problems we had to wait for another aircraft queuing.
I therefore had enough time to me to make a few thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
Finding a half a day to wait at the airport on a flight, is quite nervtötend - even when books, magazines and iPhones steuerfreies go shopping) (and, of course, be made available.
But increasingly Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead to academics and boring as something positive.
If it is to them, it is for us, and our children - sometimes seem to be.
That the brain will be forced to lose in interesting considerations, which is perhaps the creativity.
And because most of us, today, almost constantly on one or other to screen the rigid advantages of boredom not more.
Sollten we welcome with open arms the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
I repeat:' come.
Like many people, I am always assumed that relatively topical boredom a phenomenon which has developed more leisure time.
However, Mr Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of 'Boredom: A Yale University (Lively History' Press, 2011), that is not the case.
'In fact the boredom has a very long history, he says.
The fault Hauswände Pompejis Latin on boredom graffiti on the first century.
And then there is the question is, how do we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, a partner in the university professor of psychology Ontario York, the problem is that, according to many kinds of boredom Canada to be defined and has been discussed.
After long read Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of almost 100 people were Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that, as the experience of boredom 'exercise, a satisfactory result, it does not want to be able to define'.
boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person, but this would not work.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to 'disturbance of Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slow'.
boredom can listen to this almost as depression.
But, although Professor Eastwood believe these two conditions in relation to people are bored could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we that is boring us, even if we do not just have to focus.
In their report 'The Unengaged Mind Defining Boredom in terms: Attention' in German, for instance: ``The untätige reason: The definition of boredom in terms of 'attention in September in the journal' Perspectives on Psychological Science 'appeared, Professor out Eastwood, and his colleagues on an earlier experiment in a single volume, the participants to listen to a Magazinartikel read a person.
Some groups have heard a resounding channel from the neighbouring region, which has nothing to do with the content was heard it on others; low noise level, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group is not at all a noise, I heard this.
The people who have heard the barely recognisable television, to try to have more boredom as the other two groups - they had problems to focus, for this could be no reason to their difficulties and wrote the boredom.
If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding task could lead to disruption of boredom, Mark says J. Fenske for neuroscience progresses, associative professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, makes for tedious work into 'as the search for defective products on a Fabrikförderband that music bored and can help to feel, not'.
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln Kritzeln and often interpreted as a sign of boredom, this can even be fought by physical persons to be more vigilant.
'studies have shown that children learn herumhampeln Professor more and more than those who are forced to Stillsitzen' Fenske must keep information.
We will, at some point, all wearing my delayed flight - a dröhnender, loudspeakers particularly ermüdender film industry.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order for these differences, researchers - developed in the 1980s to a' scale Langeweileanfälligkeit '.
Following the statements such as' will find many things that I have to do is repeat and monotonous' and'I have many interests, that I do not have enough time for everything.
help of such scale researchers have discovered that more girls than boys, tedious as Stephen Vodanovich, a professor at the University of psychology Westflorida, in particular, as regards the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli.
But in general are a fairly abgespannter bunch of teenagers.
In 1991, Reed Larson by Professor for human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment where he kontaktierte almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found out that 32% of adolescents in schools and in the homework Erledigen if they were not at school, whereas bored and bored, 23%.
However, only 3% of parents to have to feel bored.
Professor Larson now saying that he does not know whether the exact percentages 21 years later, in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.
He is sure, however, that 'the young people as extremely boring because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their mainly perceived Alltagsablauf.'
Back to my Ursprungsfrage: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, in extreme cases, because it means that people and extreme physical risks to gambling, or drugs, in order to alleviate the studies have shown.
Andererseits many philosophers and authors to examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich the issue of research, for more than two decades.
'With the boredom the brain want to say that we should do something different, Mr Marcus, psychology professor at the University of New York.
But the brain, do not always know what is best in particular.
If a dull and the energy we use to play and to cook Gitarre, you will be happy.
However, in the short term for TV can ensure that these verflüchtigen Glücksgefühle long term, but again.
If his bored child is an iPad, so that it can be diverted from boredom. It has not, however, in order to maintain or to control, Professor Fenske says.
And it also adds that 'self - regulation is a situation of' on the other.
The baby learns, not only to maintain but also in other areas to be more self - regulation.
I do not think we should celebrate boredom.
Even we should not be too critical.
Stattdessen our aim should be to us at ease outside the permanent Aktivitäts and Technologieberieselung.
Professor Eastwood to the vote.
'It sounds as we often have to be boring. But boredom is distressing, relentless desire to do something meaningful', he says.
He believes that the people are in reality, only after a way, to shut down and less so.
'In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to discuss even if the noise is.'
In Colorado, there are no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-j - year Community College-Student and footballers Anthony Orozco in the south - east is Colorados court for a crime in that Member State will soon be legal, the possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he rauchte this.
Orozco, were he and some friends Septembertag a car in Lamar close to the border with Kansas, as they were travelling.
Following the police officers marijuana they appear in the car - Orozco has been found for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien excusable peccadilloes received, each with a fine of USD 100 - and a court hearing.
'We are being treated like criminals ', Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalise small quantities of marihuana, to find the answer depends less on hundreds of smaller drug offences by the law, as the location.
hundreds of regulatory offence for marijuana be, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures, already abandoned.
The police forces are adults on 21 years ago no longer for the possession of small extent. This is legally permitted, as soon as the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced to quote, existing Marihuanadelikte and people are still in a court of law.
Regarding the same time, several cities in the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountain about new state to prevent Marihuanageschäfte licensed in the opening in their communities.
'This situation is developing so quickly that I do not know what the next step will be to be done, Mr J. Oates says Aurora police chief in the east, in Denver.
And even regulators in the State is therefore a Washington on the head.
you are waiting for a report on the establishment of the licensing systems of production, production, distribution and sale of drugs - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, we are of the opinion that, in any case, Colorado the majority of States, which is the subject of the regulation of marijuana. drugs legalised, which was only for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum.
'Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore right for the orientation, Brian E. Smith said, the spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But to Smith also that no place or system more than in the sense of a broad guidelines to be able to do that.
'We have no real precedent which can we follow ', he added.
The Washington I-502 law, on 6 December, to enter into force and thus represents the end point in a grey area in which the State licensing system to legalise possession, but still does not exist.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified in this period, for example, such as the imposition of a state 'adequate access to' lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften around 300 metres for schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
'nowhere it will be difficult to find a location for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, in particular in the agglomeration of Seattle, Ben Livingston thinks that the spokesman for the' legal 'Centre for cannabis, a recent research group formed.
On 21 November Chief Oates his staff in Aurora sent an e - mail, in which he stated that the public prosecutor would inherit Marihuanadelikte people no longer than 21 years, and that the police do not want 'immediately' Strafanzeigen for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police to continue to implement urban plans for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers will continue to be persecuted.
In the north County Weld Colorados Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote on its authority, would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly in order to move to consumers.
Aktuell 119 people responsible must be in possession of around 50 grams a court or marijuana, although many others were accused of offences.
'Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements, which was the Tatzeitpunkt crimes' Buck, in a declaration.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where the voters Marihuana-Initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of Landkreises, shows the possession of small quantities of adults.
Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but decided not to let all outstanding Besitzverfahren.
'I do not believe that I mean wastes time, the right to impose it, he says' change.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado, supported by the measure at the beginning that it was compatible with the personal consumption of marihuana, with the complexities of the government and the legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state, local officials expended a great struggle with regard to the big green experiment.
In Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a ``cultural barrier, Sean McAllister says that a lawyer in Denver, which represents Marihuanadelikte to court and defendants on the ground as spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of Marihuanagesetzen operates.
'you have spent so that such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for the fact that they are still unable to accept the legalisation, it believes in.
The first states, the smaller quantities of marihuana, such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington to be treated as a national Musterfälle for the legalization of drugs.
As defenders and civil servants at the age of legal sale of them at the same time to prepare, nervous orders of the German Government, which treat the sale and the cultivation of marijuana to continue to act as a federal level.
advocate the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the Federal German Government to allow the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 for most other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik-Berater the Obama administration is of the opinion that Kriminalbeamte probably not be in order to seize the smaller quantities of drugs which, under the new legislation, a legal, state - regulated Marihuana-Gesch forces are to be, but we are probably
There are various cities in Colorado not wait for that the federal authorities.
As approved before the elections, some local municipalities forces moratoria on new Marihuana-Gesch, although this is only about a year could be opened up.
Last week, a town Montrose decided in the West, a six - month ban which will probably be adopted next week.
'We do not want to end up in a position in which we at federal level licence and then someone who have a huge problem, as Mr Nicholson, municipal councillor.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We have, then, for which the Community has decided, and not according to which the state has decided.
A number of questions remain open.
I have had from Oxford mobbed Petronella Wyatt, because I am a Tory
Not only university students are attacked today for their views
The very it was always been extremely my dream to be given a place in the Oxford University.
Both my father and I visited the University of older brother, I once for the largest Wissenstempel the world, for a modern Greek symposium, which facilitated the great pillars of civilisation - free - thinking and tolerance.
However, in the space of two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College the end of the 1980s, I was there to study history - I had intended to put my suitcases and again as the first scandal about my life.
My father, collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, I would have said, because I had a problem with continental colleagues that in neighbouring room sex would have had.
The writer A schelmisch N Wilson said, I would have left the University of damaged cups because I was forced to drink.
The truth is that there has been less amusing.
It ran away.
Yes, because I was systematischem suffered harassment and threats.
It is not about because of my name or rather unusual, because I was a Privatschule.
We had, harassed for one reason only reason why in this supposed cradle of narrow - minded and cruel seemed so now: my late father was an important Woodrow Wyatt of Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports of a new generation of students is suffering of the moderate rights under similar persecution.
The organised and growing hatred on Tory-Studenten has now developed in Oxford such dimensions that a group of them last week, the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz, gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative Members of the junior common rooms (JCR) of the corpus of Christ College to be active in isolation, they are often due to their political views' personal attack, and says' undesirable.
you are calling for a place in the Gleichberechtigungskomitee of the College, in order to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Verschlimmert their situation by a recent article watch on political students on BBC Two, ``Wonderland: Young Bright, and on the Right, was the Tories as eccentrics and neo - Nazis.
That has been shown, among other things, to graduate from Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative student Association of Oxford University in a continued fear and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte.
An other universities say conservative students, they are seen as a ``scapegoats for the introduction of higher fees'.
The 20 - year - old Luke black, Vice - President of the conservative Studentenvereinigung the University of Nottingham, has stated in a Sunday newspaper:' There is a growing Linkstendenz universities.
The people believe that we are as the Bullingdon club, without even come to us'.
Bishop Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in corpus of Christ, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate. The 'inconvenient' 19-j - year - old Stephanie Cherill designated President, the conservative student unification of Oxford says that we have observed in JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate rights.
'This is a threat to the intellectual debate and for the well - being of its members, it says'.
In my first weeks in Oxford I was in a minority.
As an unbelievably timid -18 year olds in September I was reached in 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the last year the university voted in favour, to give Mrs Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education no title of honour.
The atmosphere I would even Stalinists squirm.
In the early days of Erstsemester-Woche, in the new students Tutoren to get to know each other, and I had a foretaste of what is happening in the future.
I drew to the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory-Studenten duldeten not only, but also happily take part.
Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa have found their way into the holzgetäfelten Tutoriums of areas.
During my first of these events, I should in the 18th century French texts translated into English. At what should then, I had not been taken.
'Miss Wyatt the tutor said' Harry Pitt (have passed 'booths, you ask the first paragraph.
I, I came here.
Pitt was a small man with a human face, and as from Kuchenteig rather be horrendous.
'Thatcher-Anh Weigern to learn, French, or are they just stupid? ', he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
In my eyes, tears wallten on.
'I propose that they take a few Französischstunden in your leisure, so, if you are not very much to your social activities are of concern to me, Pitt knurrte'.
I came back with hängendem capita in my room.
This evening, I was having dinner alone in the College, as somebody tippte easy on the back.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year of James who, as a member of the Conservative student Association presented.
``I know that you know, he said 'kind.
Unfortunately, it is how it is.
Anyone who is suspected of Tory to be harassed.
For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father, Margaret Thatcher, therefore, is for you, it will be worse.
The majority, to be giving Tory-Erstsemester, supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pubs, I tried to later.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher.
This device should prove to be a failure.
An Studienanfänger on political and economic philosophy which, ironically, this is a conservative Eton visited the College, said to me: ``You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins'.
being polluted.
Other students share his opinion.
I was dreckig and perverse.
'As Tories have sex? "asked of me.
The propose, or each other?
I felt, such as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation of the United States have had to have felt.
I have ever, be it at the University of Oxford to lead a normal life?
dignity Gleichgesinnte I can only go out after?
Should the Labour Party, and I turn to my natural inclination to suppress it?
The three years, which had reached before me, before my intellectual eye to purgatory of the ban and isolation.
The only tutor, which were open to a Tory, Norman Stone, Professor for contemporary history, which has its seat in the College.
He was not only for this to be a Conservative Steel Community, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy, for it was written speeches and consult.
He was only rarely.
He was the place where it hated parochial and small, and it is his marxistisch-deterministische Geschichtsperspektive.
1997 was in my professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
'You will not be happy, he said to me'.
I began to travel between Oxford and the House, my parents and seek refuge in open friends and relatives in the city.
Meinem father I told that I hated Oxford and why I did so.
He seemed disbelief.
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.
``But it is the best place in the world ', he said meekly.
That is something they would never do not, in my city of träumenden Turmspitzen.
Even my communist friends, always good manners.
His wet which marred eyes.
Give the whole, a chance.
I am sure that you only neckt.
It would be my heart to break gingst if you.
Erschöpft by my frequent visits to London my emotional reaction was weaker.
One of my male friends Tory-Anh too, had given in to the pressure and renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums the following week, a further serious Geschichtstutor had claimed that I was ``an enemy of the people, I decided to do the same.
Although I head in shame zerging secret, I have been subjected to me that my parents' brainwashing 'and they were called' old 'aiming.
The facilitation of lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the proposed the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford-Karriere.
At that time, he wrote per week in the Murdoch press two columns.
My door was closed.
I hidden, in this room, and after five minutes at my Häscher.
When they, I received a suitcase packte and adopted the first train to London.
I never come back.
I am happy to give you a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But no 18 - year - old should ever at a school in such intimidation and to malice.
And even more tragic that it was an Oxford University, which had only 14 Tory-Premierminister, but not far behind a windfall reputation of equality and freedom of thought hidden.

The same applies to it every day on the ground down his Kraters increase in the world where the gas ausströmende schwefelhaltige stuck in contact with the air.
Given the major Schwefelsteine it undermined as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilos, he has moved it in two Bambuskörben on its shoulders further about the blocking of stone.

You know that every step their lives, it can cost as a French Touristin happened a few years ago, the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen tonne.
The Minenarbeiter of Kawah Ijen five cents deserve every kilo of sulphur, for it.
Oben, it is clear the path between the tourists Zirkusaffen they are taking and tedious serious baskets with the three kilometres to the balance, which established a Minengesellschaft a little further down a EUR 1 850 metre has
The society PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960, the presence of the volcano and [never rather its workers), which it pays sulphur 662 Indonesian Rupien (5 cent) for every kilo.
The then sold for Rupien (83 euro cents per 10 000), to the petrochemical industry, because this is a widespread and minerals in everyday life for the manufacture of Streichhölzern Feuerwerksartikeln, cosmetics, in particular, and even the Bleichen of sugar will be used.
'As we normally bear 70 kilos of any way, we receive approximately 46 000 Rupien (EUR 3.8 Anto stated that' we are normally makes three routes in the day.
For every line he needs three hours, which is completely achieved at the end of the day, but then he has 138.000 Rupien (11.5 euro).

which he deserved Rupien 75 000 (EUR 6.2 the day, and the work has not been so hard, but Anto has returned after Banyuwangi with his family, a village near, and that for a reason that in Indonesia as important as the sulphur is: 'I have married a girl from Bali, where Hindus, they are, and I have brought with them after Java converting to Islam '.
Anto has an asthma, with difficulty, coughs and its eyes are a temptation often because of the toxic gases.
The 27 jährige Anto, for three years of his life is at stake on Kawah Ijen sulphur in which he has already left the first evidence, although it covers his face with a pretext and Spezialbrille.

Singapore needs to save the economy.
The Singapurer the blame for the fact that they have no children on the career, the stress and the costs of property and the bringing up children.
'The population has to grow from Singapore'.
I am a patriotischer husband, being patriotic my wife, we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore viralen a video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a Rapper-Songs, the local slogans such as' Schieben a' bao " (loaf) in the foot, about the low birth rate in Singapore to make.
The advertising agency BBH has done, the video that preserves the hope that the advert on entertaining way to achieve the problem.
your creative head Alexander Hamilton says that he use the power of the music for people to fulfil their 'national duty to'.
This is something that only on the Internet we therefore had to be - and make fun.
It is the biggest problem in the country.
The Fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, so we remarked that this is an issue to which we had to deal with.
We knew that the government is attempting, for example, how much the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of Speed-Dating-Abenden (rapid Flirts).
You were Möglich creative that many of these ideas, but not necessarily to success.
Therefore we thought: why do we not make a creative way as possible, in order to tackle this problem, such as, for example, to a rap komponieren?
1.2 children
Who is not easy to this issue, the government is of Singapore.
Every year, they are from USD 1 300 for political action to encourage the citizens to have more children.
A package of the government for married couples to parents and up to 15 000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and distributed fiscal advantages.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city state in south - east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and the strict social controls is well known.
According to its national Bevölkerungsbehörde the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate of 2 - which, as is well known - Ersetzungsrate was in 1976.
So, why the Singapurer not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Executive Director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this is the result of a ``better training and career is more '.
'This has enabled the people, to marry and to establish a family to put much more options with regard to life goals and priorities ', they said.
These changes in the social conditions for the higher number of single parents and the delay in the marriage have contributed and births, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Währenddessen an immigration policy, which has led to a drastic rise in Zuwanderungen aims to the reduction of the population to feelings of resentment in the local population.
In Singapore websites, where there is a covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, particularly against the Chinese, who criticised that it will maintain low wages and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons for the ruling party in Singapore its worst possible outcome reached last year since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
Whilst the falling birth rate, the well - known impact on the growth of a nation, the tax revenues that the health costs and the immigration policy, this example shows, Singapore, unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes to be built.
However, it also has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started to monitor the number of small Appartements as' and 'Schuhschachteln are known in certain areas of the city must be built.
This Appartements have a Wohnfläche of 46 square metres and show a large Verkaufserfolg.
But there is the concern that they promote the way of life of the people living alone and that it will discourage to build the construction of housing, for large families.
But Lim Yew Soon, the Director - General of Immobilienfirma EL Developers, says, to sell his' Schuhschachteln 'much more quickly than larger houses.
You are so popular, and units are compromising the days and weeks to even more quickly than the larger houses.
This means that for our Cash Flow very much better.
He is, however, that to be the developers new clearer standards which previously put obstacles in the way when they are too many small houses were in a project that has been made.
Regarding a lot of stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules are preparing the way for an increase in the birth rate is clear from the talks with the Singapurern Finanzviertel in the work that they have no real impact could be.
'The people are strong gestresst, the housing and education are expensive, and many a young managers will be delayed.
The children can get other.
'For me it is important to have my own money and time to have another says' approximately 20 - year - old man.
men and women in their careers, the stress and the cost of their ownership and education as the reasons why they do not have children.
And the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to children, as the government can do so much.

Fabrizio was 21 years old, when he was: the inquiry was HIV positive.
'It was as if a bomb stores' he says about the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent attempts to 'success'.
He hidden it prior to his family.
He decided to have only started his illness and to be informed, and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest of the hospital patients HIV-Einheit Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which it was after many battles in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane Immundefizienz-Virus (HIV), 22 years, since the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to imagine when there were many doubts, few treatment and stigma.
Damals it has itself to adopt the director of a clinic IMSS, the 'because in a dead end.
Damals AIDS synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
But many people are still in hospital, and that none of their disease in which the virus has already caused by their immune system and is exhausted, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the arrival of the AIDS in the world, that is to say the date of the first reported cases of 'the great success today means, the head of the declared HIV-Einheit HCG, Jaime Villanueva Andrade, in which he said that the information that the survival of a patient who starts on time the treatment, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same in April of this year, a reputable scientific publication has been based.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV\/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva by the scientists, that since 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life of the degree of prejudice to the immune system depended the people at the start of the treatment, and that would have a greater chance of those which are not end up to 30 years in a sort of 200 CD4 and 50 years, in a sort of 500 CD4:.
Einfach said that the above, mean that, in the age of 25 who receives the diagnosis HIV positive here can easily be 75 years of age, as long as it is under control, this expert said.

The mere Jalisco in the year 2011 255 people died, and until the month of May this year there are, however, already assured 187 deaths, since 2005, there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- Why is, people still die?
In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
at least in the last 12 years, we have had no problems in the medicines. The problem is that the people in an advanced status far, because they do not know its Infektionszustand very late stage, in other words the disease.
He makes a resounding message:' Nine really do represent 10 patients come to us if they already have a sense of infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all the people, where this is necessary, must be offered a screening tests'.
This proposal to vote in favour of the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (Committee on the State of Jalisco AIDS-Vermeidung) and patients as Fabrizio, the test was carried out in a private laboratories, for the sole reason that it is a friend of the young age, despite its AIDS-Phase was already and even had the tumour krebsartigen Kaposi-Sarkom (a), which is the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and do not want to hear.

The amendment was to improve, as I am, that drives ernähre good sport and take note of the medicines.
Today only his parents know that he had cancer.

Following the Court of Appeal confirms the United States a judgement which recognises the restructuring of debt on the group Vitro Handelskonkurs in Mexico has been achieved, not a precedent is created, pernicious for, each national companies with establishments in the neighbouring country, there are payment problems.
We are, then, that the procedures for the survival of companies which allow the Mexican law in the country of the stars and stripes could say contrary to international agreement to be a valid.
In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas that the Mexican companies in the confiscation of property, on the other side of the River Congratulations are helpless.
But the biggest Glashersteller decision opens the door in Mexico, because three inconsistencies to refer the matter to the Supreme Court of the United States.
During the judges of the matter is that the main proceedings in Mexico Handelskonkurs dealt with by the Court of Appeal, says the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, begin by pointing out that the creditor, the bankruptcy rules must be subject to the United States.
The first point, the international cooperation in insolvency proceedings by companies with trans - national profile is not known.
In fact the Modellgesetz to this end the United Nations was created for the harmonisation of international trade law, with the American law has been set up as arbiter institutions.
Secondly the ruling states that the majority required for the restructuring of debt without the votes of the societies to recognise the liabilities in the liquidation of the branches Vitro with its parent company that had not been achieved.
But this possibility is recognised by the Mexican law.
In fact Vitro is not the first case in which this system has been allowed.
There are examples, including half a dozen Agremex Mexicana Comercial and their liabilities in the group of companies by the Istituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse) have been confirmed.
the creditor Richtig is also that, after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches of Vitro, creditors in the courts in the United States against Vitro there, in other words the Geier-Fonds such as Capital Aurelios Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional Limited and Liverpool, have achieved a majority.
The vote was 45% would be against 37%.
This will not be taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal.
Andererseits Vitro there is blame for its difficult situation in 2008 in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country.
For this reason, the family, González Sada before the same court of appeal, so that the vote in plenary, that is to say, because of the judges were only three of them.
If not, the Cerciorare-Einspruch, will the calls for the review of the procedure by a higher body, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious aspect of this case is that the Court has set aside a document that the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the Court, which was sent by Vitro procedure within the framework of the law on what is described Handelskonkurse, and what that we stick to the agreements signed by the two countries to the chapter 15 Konkursgesetzes of the United States to comply with, and, had kept
is also important to point out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on the international trade in other words, the rules laid down in the event of cross - border cases, guarantee equality of debtors and creditors.

Héctor 'Hetin Reyes ": ``basketball was my life'
The Weltenbummler Basketballs of Héctor Hetin ," ``the Korbsport Reyes, has been more than 60 years and has visited the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the country as' Basketballs Héctor Hetin Reyes'.
Before he, in 2008, by a stroke of the wheelchair Rexes, 6 years was part of that sport, it should be a player and lower classes, players in the first national League and head of the agent BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or Basketballverbands President.
'My life I have drafted in basketball me many, indeed, several hats at the same time, when I was the chief BSN President, the President of the Union and national team in the 1990s are reminded Reyes, during a visit by Primera Hora at home with him in Bayamón, Isabel, its loyal wife, for more than 50 years of residence.
'basketball was my life.'
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of this House long career, they are almost all dekoriert with photographs and memories of his and bear witness to it.
Bayamón heart
The emotionalsten memories are those that in his time Vaqueros in the middle of the 1950s, the players to 1982, where it will be celebrated as Mitgeschäftsführer or 15 - year - old anniversary of the club managers.
These were 'my best years that I have enjoyed the most, because I would be part of the eight championships Vaqueros since 1967, it was as Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.
It was met many years, including five championships in 1975, one by one, the 1971.
And then I have adopted with a championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy BSN in.
From then took over 'Cuco Ortiz', which was a very good managers' Reyes says.
I know that at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was given to me Bartow genes, worked as a trainer and said: ``I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
Möchtest you it? '
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, Puerto Rico had ever.
Bartow subsequently the recommended Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, which was one of our best and could creep Werfer.
I know, as he said that, if a championship Mincy allows for Bayamon Gausse had to be a further.
The Vaqueros Gausse with the championship, but he was already out of a gap in 1988, because it already has been at the top of the Union.
At that time, he drew it to enjoy its application and the Mincy in the national football team.
I remember when we first time on the vorolympischen Turnier in Mexico, against the United States.
bronze should be, if not actually Canadian the referee the recent Spielzug after the World Cup was in 1990, in which we said Reyes, whereas the fourth place repeat what has, for the second time,
War this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you have ever seen?
you is one of the best, as well as those who work in the 2004 Olympic Games to the dream team won.
My favourite but the team of the 1991 panamerikanischen Games in Cuba, where we won and gold the team of the United States has offered a fight, as when they won in the World Cup bronze.
With regard to the crew were not only Mincy Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Robert Fico López and 'Piculín Ortiz (once again), but also the young players (Javier) ',' Toñito Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, the 1990, for a Knieverletzung not able to be here.
A team, which in terms of figures, perhaps not the best, but with the gold medal won and which are a cause of great joy of those was vorolympischen Turniers Neuquén in 1995, Argentina.
With such as' Canito Nieves' players, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the players are closed because of the events in the Mar del Plata Panamerikanischen Games, we won contrary to all the gold medal forecast.
Who was the best players of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournament are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico at this level that has dominated Piculín as such.
And this, without taking account of his career in the various bodies, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We had a number of good and coach, Julio Toro Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boy I like the work of Leo Arill well.
Do I is the best in the Association of what you have achieved?
I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995 BSN the beginning of the 1990s was up to 17 teams in a season.
What you are doing is?
There are things that I could have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The fact that the boys Ponce in, for example, only play in their territory, and only in the national Playoffs on crews from other parts of the island.
Today many children make unnecessary travel and Games.
I see at least the result of the prescribed and training courses for coach, and referee Tisch-Offizielle.
I am proud of my.
What you are going to do now?
I am happy to listen to music, videos of music my time on YouTube and enjoy my grandchildren and I can go to a Basketballspiel.
And of course, I have been enjoying my wife, Isabel society, which was always on my side.
