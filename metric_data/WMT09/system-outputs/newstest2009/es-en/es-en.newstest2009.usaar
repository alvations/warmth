Prague the finished with fewer points at the end of day 
After the rapid fall of the morning the Prague corrected their losses. 
The transactions of actions of reached approximately the valuable half that they have on a day normal. 
The Bag of Prague, at the beginning of Tuesday trading, reacted immediately to the fall of the Monday when it went down approximately to 6%. 
reduction of this time the is due to the fall of the actions in Wall Street. 
Also here the reaction of the market is expressed in the face of the result of the poll of the American Assembly of Representatives that it refused to supporting the plan of stabilization of the secretary of the financial sector. 
Fall of actions in Asia 
actions of the Asian the lived on Tuesday a dramatic fallen, although finally throughout the day the index toned down part of the leaks. 
The index of the Bag Hang Seng of Hong Kong throughout its financial day marked almost four per cent, although later it toned down their losses reducing the descent practically by 2,5 per cent. 
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises that follows the movements of the actions Chinese in the of Hong Kong went down 3,8 per cent, in Shanghai the markets were closed. 
The actions of the of Sydney lost more of five per cent but, in the end, the leaks went down to 4,3 per cent. 
The Bag of Taiwan according to the secretary of the index went down to 3,6 per cent. 
"The actions of rescue programmed in USA. are insecure and this influences the financial market of everything the world", indicated the Head of the Office of the Coin of Hong Kong, Joseph Yam. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sóla determines its policy monetary, that is, without dependence from the Central Bank of China. 
rate interest of Hong Kong those are at the same level as those of the United States. 
The American legislators would as soon as possible should meet, according to the Prime Minister Australian Kevin Rudd, again, and should approve a proposal of support to the financial system. 
In another way, he threatens so the falls will be made feel in other countries. 
Bloody bath of the American actions 
On Monday the of refused the plan of help to the financial system to which they should be dedicated 700 dollars (almost some 12 billion kroner). 
The legislators, of that form, were unaware of the invitation of the president George Bush to support his plan. 
For Bush the plan would solve the causes fundamental of the crisis financial and would help stabilize whole the economy. 
On Monday the actions American lived a bathing bloody and mainly rate of the actions collected the biggest fall in more than 20 years. 
index Dow Jones lowered to almost seven per cent. fall of volume similar was registered by last time in 1987. 
The index already went down before being announced but so soon it was shown that the proposal of the house did not get through, the index started to fall freely. 
The congress retires: government US. can inject 700 dollars in banking 
The tallest representatives of the and of the government, the president George W. Bush, came themselves to an agreement in a pact in detailed terms of aid financial to the system of finance American. 
Its poll will be carried out at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators provoked a gap in the conversations about the approval of the plan of ransom in its form of help to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion millions of dollars (approximately 12 billion kroner). 
However, it is not yet gained. 
The congress members must refine some details of the contract before they can do public the final form of the law and of which it is voted. 
The plan of help to the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the of. 
He told the agency Reuters news, Barney Frank, president of the Committee for Financial Services and of the, Sunday. 
According to some fountains the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate not before the Wednesday. 
According to the economists, the arrival of the ratification of the plan rescue should represent the announcement of a first factor psychologically significant for the revitalization of the market financial. 
Afterwards, however, people will arrive to the "de-enchantment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose support the market it will reach also in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have carried out a breakthrough. 
We solve our discrepant opinions with regard to the way that the packet of measures for the stabilization of the market must have "commented the democrat Nancy Pelosiá to the agency Bloomberg. 
According to it the vote final could still be carried out on Sunday. 
of the legislators were brought together on Sunday at night with the financial minister, Henry Paulson, to give a way definitive to the of the government. 
This should buy of the finance companies the not sold mortgage assets that they take to the financial companies to tough losses and threaten the stability of whole the system. 
"We are about to close the convention" on the plan, which will work and will also have to be effective in the market. 
It is necessary still to continue with the plan of sanitation, but think that we are already in that ", said Paulson. 
signal to the business Asian 
The global financial crisis affects expressly the market of actions that they bring down with rapidly. 
According to the democratic senator for Nevada, Harry Reid the legislators are making everything possible so that definitely the Congress approves an agreement this Sunday. 
They want with that to calm the businesses of the investors in front of the market for finance Asian down since these are the ones that they find in the first time zone and where the Congress could be influential in trade on Monday. 
However, for now there is not at all clear with certainty on when they will vote the two cameras of the American Congress and, not even, if they will not stagnate in the last moment with some problem. 
The legislators think that it will be approved on coming days. 
The law, will however suffer a series of changes. 
The total quantity destined to help to the system must be divided up into two parts. 
The first 350 a billion as soon as possible have to be availably, as he requested President George Bush. 
However, the Congress can block the release of the quantity remaining if it had the impression that the programme does not comply with its role, what would be been about another 100 a billion of dollars and, later, of the last 350 a billion dollars. 
Bush valued the progress of the meetings 
On the other hand the president can veto this decision but the Congress can surpass their veto for a majority of votes. 
In spite of these changes the basic idea about the program that consisted in gaining financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage bonds whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not capable of finishing paying their mortgages was preserved. 
"We have worked everything. 
of Representatives the should be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate the Monday ", commented on the republican senator, Judd Gregg. 
the President American Bush is satisfied with the progress of the meetings. 
Its spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance of Saturday and that he values "the determination of both parties because it stabilizes our market financial and protects our economics". 
Limitation of the armored contract 
The president of the bank Committee of the senate, Christopher Dodd head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the money of the program for the protection of the taxes of the taxpayers of their losses, a closure aliviadora of the programmed financial plan. 
new law must also limit the called contracts participants of the programme armored for directors of societies, and creates a committee that will have a control of. 
This should direct it the finance. 
"We have worked in a very hard way in that, and have carried out a great advance towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all the American", commented on Paulson. 
The plan counts also on helping the owners of homes that have problems with their payments. 
government the should be come to an agreement with the new payments of the mortgages that he buys in order to bring the monthly burdens of payments to deadlines debtors down and make for them that they can keep their homes possible. 
Marek: 
psychological help The suggested plan is David Marek, a good idea that will be carried out but quite difficult, according to the economist head of Homeland Finance. 
"and it is because of this that it is not known with what mechanism and to what price they will buy themselves the problematic assets. 
This will be decisive for the distribution of the leaks between the financial sector and the government ", said Marek this week, for the servant iHNed.cz. 
That the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant. 
"Much more important is that, already this week the congress members are put of agree on their support and give it his everything seen good as soon as is been able. 
This important and psychological agreement that it is arrived to that adoption is, in these moments, the most important thing, "Marek insisted. 
It fights armed: the Reproducer of MP3 players against the mobile. 
We recommend him as choosing 
Whereas almost all mobile reproduces files of MP3 any reproductive MP3 players manages to do calls. 
What it seems clearing that it is better to buy oneself only the telephone. 
Still like this there are sufficient grounds as so that the man purchases only reproductive. 
choice the depends practically on way of their use the and on requirement of future owner. 
Probably it will be difficult that it purchases the most modern record player to listen in it to the last album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the other hand this type of musical products as they are the disks of LP already do not come out, and as for their quality there is not nor one reason objective to keep buying them. 
If the disks of vinyl with music of rock art, jazz or blues, probably pile up in their shelves be dreaming, at least, of this type of record player. 
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed music, simplified - music in MP3. 
And here there are categories of price and quality. 
For some it can be unacceptable to use up eight thousand crowns in a reproducer, the same as for a lover of Pink Floyd who will hardly try the helmets of fair of at eight thousand kroner. 
Two ends, among which there is enough space for each. 
The choice is wide. 
He also decides the duration of the battery 
One of the best players obtains much more than only to reproduce music and even that not even most of the mobile. 
No current device is as universal as the telephone is. 
In the face of the most basic functions as phoning, to send messages, can reproduce musical and video, to record both, has a better or worse apparatus photograph and even can manage to sail. 
And when we take the Smartphone and the PDA in consideration they are going to have a small computer in his pocket. 
This is a small miracle since to do knows how to do a roast and no television can photograph. 
universality of mobiles brings us also disadvantages. 
more functions it uses in the mobile before will be illuminated the indicator of the screen asking that he is recharged. 
And the reproduction of music is one of the oldest guzzlers of energy. 
Few are the mobiles that more than ten or twelve hours manage to reproduce musical, the majority a lot less. 
In this sense, the reproducers of music (especially the simplest) have better performance clearly. 
that's why, take that the mobile cheap will not reproduce more than two hours into account. 
If besides this, they call constantly above still obtain you, for more safety, a loader for the work - this is valid also for appliances more expensive. 
With Reproductive MP3 players this problem is not going to have it, for even the worst last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted functioning after a burden. 
Another problem happens when recording music in the mobile. 
unfortunately only one part of the equipment has the universal connector USB and, besides, not all them can be connected directly to the computer without a software special. 
Of course that it is possible to record music directly in the card of memory but only in certain units the small memory boards that are used in the mobiles can be connected by readers without reduction. 
In the players, with some exception (iPod), any software special is necessary. 
It is enough to fill the apparatus with music through the USB's computer. 
The majority of mobile and players create alone its order in the musical library according to the name of the interpreter title of the album, gender or also according to assessment of user. 
Some devices only show a directory with structure of tree similar to a of Windows and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon phones smart system operating). 
reproductive the tries to serve, the mobile knows more 
For the election of a team particular show interest in the endurance of the accumulator, for the ability of the memory, for the quality and the type of sound and, of course, for the comfort of its handling. 
If he listens, especially, to the music as fund and is going to listen each day to it just a short while ago, as in the tram, then for him any mobile that it reproduces is been enough. 
What practically obtains really any mobile. 
It must not even show interest of the format in which the mobile or the reproductive reproduce the music. 
They all reproduce the MP3 and, practically, almost all the music that people arrive it will be in this format. 
It is among the more extended and the absolute majority of the devices excluding it for him they reproduce music in format WMA. 
The less they include the format PCA (format used by the company Apple and its iPod). 
The best mobiles make the purchase of music online possible, also for example. 
It is enough in the middle of the internet of the mobile to visit the competent pages of the operator (or of any other lender of service) and to buy a song or an album to itself. 
This service could be by itself alone an argument of peso to acquire a mobile phone for music. 
unfortunately the supply of operators is miserable and the majority is limited alone to the subjects of fleeting success of the radios. 
Prices the are not the lowest either. 
However, it is in general supposed that precisely this way of sale of music (be already wireless for GSM, the Internet or internet) in the future will dominate the industry of the music. 
majority of the people always takes above a mobile. 
As long as it feels like listening to something, it will find the mobile in your pocket, whereas the reproductive MP3 players will remain forgotten at home. 
However, if his always taking some headphones or, at least, the handsfree with itself still depends. 
If it is not like this, it can use an integrated reproducer that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least a reproductive MP3 players. 
Probably the biggest advantage for many of phones mobile with music will be its price. 
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand kroner it can already purchase a good walkman. 
the of a ticket will limit you to most of you for headphones classics. 
The best, even as for the technical part, as the telephones equipped with a entry 3.5 mm. for some headphones classic, they cost up to fifteen thousand. 
Again the advantage of the players is not another thing than easy service is. 
players simpler the - no way necessarily the cheapest (to see our selection) - any person handles them really. 
The minimum functions, its handling similar to the previous cassettes currents or also to the record players is evident. 
He does not represent a threat in the sense of for mistake our connecting ourselves to internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for drop of data. 
For what apparatus to decide 
the mobile cheapest (for example the Vodafone 527) have normally a slot to change the memory board (type M2, micro SD, etc.). 
Even with the purchase of a card proper it will arrive at the two thousand kroner. 
However, be careful. 
The basic models, are normally equipped with a card of 2 GB of capacity maximum only. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If it already has a mobile phone and wants still to buy a reproductive cheap mp3 to itself, Emgeton or Iriver has a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung. 
According to the ability (at the most 2 GB) does not do lack more than 1.1 kroner to be used up. 
If it is considered of among the most demanding lovers music resort to the more specialized mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have keys independent for the MP3 what a service as comfortable as that of a same reproductive makes. 
The more specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the walkman line have almost identical use as that of a reproductive MP3 players independent. 
The same service and the same category as for price on the four thousand kroner, but with greater capacity by heart (until 16 GB) and of accumulator (normally of 15 hours, with a maximum performance of until 35 hours), the mentioned brand more arria brings them reproductive of MP3. 
The first virtual operator is already going to arrive, this year, to the Czech Republic. 
Probably 
The market of mobiles in the Czech Republic is quite a lot developed and our operators offer practically all the services as its partners of Europe occidental. 
However, we still lack here something - the virtual operator, who would oblige those to be cheaper. 
Probably it is not going to take it to arrive. 
That the Czech operators are part of the most expensive of Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz. 
Also the Office of the Czech Telecommunication (YOU) that it warned that the price of the messages SMS in our country is of the most expensive of all the confirmed rest the. 
After the last crossings of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of the rates of roaming probably people arrive to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the operators mobile Czechs the SMS that they send from the foreigner will be cheaper than if they send them from home. 
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, competence that really wants to fight is lacking. 
Probably this seems paradoxical to us, for we have three networks mobile and its high coverage is of more of 100%. 
On the contrary the operators mobile like to complain about in the market Czech there being a extreme competition. 
Of that also the president of the Board of the Czech Office of Telecommunications (YOU), Pavel Dvoák, already expressed that any longer there is not place in the Czech Republic for any other operator. 
It is perhaps truth that for a operator classic with their own network does not have any longer too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be well difficult to find any frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - the operator virtual. 
precisely the entry of the virtual operator in the market of the mobile telephony brought a distinguished descent from price in front of what also the classic operators had to react. 
At the same time, still before the entry of sharks as Tesco Perpetuum mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market of Britain voices similar were listened to there as well as here. 
It was proved that there is place for this type of operators and that they can have succeed. 
For the rest, it is not necessary to look for examples too far. 
In February this year we inform them about the debut of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 a thousand customers and to convert in the fifth operator largest of the country neighbouring. 
On the other hand, after Mobilking he finds the group Penta that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon. 
fon. advantage of the operator virtual the is in the possibility to concentrate on many more groups target specific. 
Besides, so that they can work effectively, for them it is enough many fewer customers than a classic operator. 
They do not take relatively big expenditure with themselves in construction, operation and maintenance of the network. 
In the world this type of virtual operators normally take shape with low expenses - they offer calls and messages of SMS cheap that however, often is counteracted with the offer of more adjusted services. 
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least the half of cheap with regard to the competition. 
However, as it shows the example of Mobilking in Poland it can be a good blow also bid for a nothing trivial group target. 
This operator addresses to man specifically. 
"man right the chooses Mobilking - is the operator that it likes and in whom it is been able trust", says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, that this operator virtual works. 
It is difficult to say if similar concept as that of Poland could stick in our country. 
Of that the spokesman of Vodafone, Miroslav epický, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small to access per segments on which most of the operators virtual base. 
Besides the point of view of the supply of services it is relatively saturated " 
In the Czech Republic there are not chance, say the operators of mobile 
However, it seems almost safe of if in the Czech Republic there will be some operator virtual that not being Mobilking. 
"We are talking on the expansion of this successful project, however, in the R.. Checa does not seem too encouraging. 
It is rather about the promotion of Mobilking in other countries of ours region ", said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studniková, spokesman of for the group financial Penta. 
indirectly he assured that the current operators of mobile telephony in the Czech Republic do definitely not incline in the face of this idea. 
Rather the opposite, try to make everything possible so that any potential competition rises up. 
Interest on the promotion of a virtual operator of mobile already shows it the group GTS Novera that wanted to give a step further on to convert in a real competence of Telefónica O2 in the field of customers of companies. 
"We have a great interest in that, to be able to offer to our customers not only services of fixed telephony but also of mobile telephony. 
and how much before, better. 
With this possibility we have run repeatedly into all the Czech operators of mobile telephony. 
With some of them we have managed to advance in the meetings ", said the spokesman of the group, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, better times perhaps sparkle. 
It seems to be that, for information not official, the first operator official should already arrive possibly at the end of year. 
But for now accompanied by is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence. 
"In these moments we think that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a operator virtual in the market Czech. 
The Czech market in comparison with others is a market very specific. 
Until the present nobody has been directed to us with some complex and serious project in this ground ", expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Srse, spokesman of Telefónica O2. 
Of the specificity of the Czech market other operators are explained. 
The spokesman of T - mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional compliance with the opinion of O2, adds: "Until today we have not registered any project commercial viable that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue developing. 
And he adds: "In the network from it will be difficult to find some operator virtual up to the end of year. 
Now we should already have on the table some specific contract that it was possible to study in that was so short "horizon" 
Vodafone rather directs your attention to the fulfillment of the requirements own a licence 3 G. 
Miroslav epický adds: "We are open to the negotiations with potential operators virtual, and this as for the distribution of costs and infrastructure. 
Precisely we consider it as the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field is in the member with whom to establish a network shared for one internet fast in the mobile. " 
Responsible offices - with the operators breakneck speed and meat 
The progress of the operators of mobile can be understood easily, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing the competence what would entail to falling prices and with that, to a decline in profits. 
Then Why to facilitate the entry to the competition? 
When the operators want to obtain something, they are capable of throwing of a concert, proof of that is the agarrón when U:fon rose up. 
fon. the greatest pressure to the YOU was at the moment of the entry of OR: fon for the T - Mobile society. 
Testifies it the information public accessible on the websites of the YOU. 
but precisely now OR: fon acts as argument of why not to accept a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová adds to this: Moreover, not long ago that the competitive atmosphere in the market of the mobile telephony was opened to a fourth operator. 
As for the character of the market of phone mobile the Republic Czech in it is natural that the entry of another player the market would mean requirements for it and, especially, for their services large. " 
It is because of this that this access to the operators of mobile is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulating organ. 
It is not only about the position of the YOUR, that unfortunately not has no competition in taking part in the commercial bids, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries. 
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Bids (ÚOHS). 
However, this expressed its typical position in the face of this problematic. 
"The entry of a virtual operator to market phone mobile the would be possible" that a convention closed on the rent of the necessary infrastructure between a operator phone mobile and a virtual operator. 
Until today no convention has been closed since the offer of the rather interested potentials was not interesting enough for the operators classic ", added to our question Kristián Chalupa, of the department of Foreign Relations of the ÚOHS. 
These formulated declarations do not surprise representatives of the operators. 
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is about something else than a consideration, apart from that they must observe that nobody takes advantage of his position in the market. 
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where the virtual operators work with normality we can observe that its entry into the market contributed to the descent of prices of the services of telephony mobile" 
Evidently, the pressure as for the correct functioning of the means of the market and the drop price do not enter the interest of the ÚOHS. 
Really what is dramatically startling in whole this case lies on the discordant reactions that result from the three operators mobile. 
The question of whether really it is a coincidence, is offered by itself alone. 
It is the same as with the price of petrol at the petrol pumps for clearing that is work of the chance and of a hard fight for competition is. 
"The Office in this sense has not found signs of unfair competition and does not have therefore reasons for somehow to take part. 
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore they do not have a corresponding rise of responsibility in its actions in the market. 
The necessary tools to open the market for the mobile the virtual operators, rather, miss, like this as the regulators of telecommunication ", added its answer Chalupa. 
The interpretation on position dominant in the market is one of the many points sticking. 
Evidently there is a market analysis relevant fabricated for the YOU according to which the telecommunications are a single market from the point of view of the tender commercial. 
In this type of market none of the operators Czechs naturally have a dominant position. 
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - so that a virtual operator rises up the agreement with the administrator of the network is always necessary. 
And the operator of the mobile telephony - with all its logic - has a monopoly of its network. 
Therefore, in a segment particular it must be necessarily dominant. 
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for ÚOHS should represent a warning the fact that three operators mobile rise showily in a similar way. 
The current complaints of the interested ones (inluida the mentioned society GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they are crashed against many obstacles similar. 
Loading the responsibility in the YOU is a quite common trick in the field of the telecommunications of which its hands are washed by the ÚOHS in whole this affair. 
We have already found with it in some cases alike. 
Unfortunately little time ago it was presented a new amendment to the law of telecommunications for enlargement of the competition of the YOU in the field of the commercial bids that were not taken to effect, still when a series of specialists promised that the situation would improve. 
This must know it perfectly the representatives of ÚOHS, but it is evident that their interests are in another part. 
Everything goes well, when nobody looks 
At the same time, desapercibidamente continues working a little like this as a pseudovirtual operator that in the Czech nets of mobile telephony there are already some. 
They are companies that put its own prices to the services of mobile telephony that, however, only a part are public. 
Normally they are companies that dedicate themselves to in marketing multilevel. 
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other ones offer its own services of mobile telephony. 
Normally only some chosen ones obtain the list of price these companies. 
Magic the is in that company with regard to the operator the, acts as a classic business customer of it ordering a great quantity of cards SIM. 
As customer special it will receive afterwards special prices and other offers. 
The problem is in that the commercial terms in all the Czech operators of mobile telephony forbid that type of resale. 
"If cases were discovered as the that quotation could be spoken" of infringement "in the conditions of contract that could be translated in the end of the collaboration with the given society", answered to the question on this problem Martina Kemrová. 
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this type carried out on the part of the operators of mobile telephony did not arrive to people responsible. 
Precisely in the case of the three mentioned companies they can get to be thousands of customers. 
None of the operators are against this procedure. 
With the activities of these companies they obtain gains nothing despicable and, at the same time - unlike the authentic virtual operators - any way they do not threaten its own marketing official. 
Miroslav epický warns us about the potential problems: "the law allows speculation such, however, the services of this company are only used for one contemptible so much for a hundred of customers. 
these, besides, must accept that the card SIM of their telephone is not to its name for what they can absolutely not have it as a customer normal of the operators. " 
Precisely this is what should seem it to the YOU minimally strange. 
Besides a new question appears for the ÚOHS. 
If it is that the operators of mobile telephony half close the eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of operator virtual? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has the sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is that it is not going to want it must not be content with the explanations of the operators that they do not have nor idea of this story and that its conditions trading do not allow it. 
When will we stop being the most expensive 
As it already remained clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator in the market of the mobile telephony brought a significant decline in prices of services. 
At the same time, practically in all the countries where the operator virtual rose up, the operators traditional tried more or less to protect themselves from this outbreak. 
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too much saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc. 
, In these moments the regulating organs have however taken part, in the most advanced countries, and in none of the cases did they defend the operators but their customers. 
With formal measures or informal pressure they already managed outside that the first virtual operator rose up and with it some more started to rise up. 
Unfortunately, the Czech Organ of Regulation whole this case passes it as if it were a nail burning. 
For our experience we can not stop impressing ourselves that they agree on the confusion of the powers in these cases them. 
But let's not despair. 
If it is that this information scenes behind the is correct and the operator virtual really arrives to these lands the market Czech of telephony mobile probably then starts to move again. 
If one of the operators lets enter some operator virtual mobile it will be difficult that the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested. 
And we perhaps will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the anthem official Czech. 
On Sunday the, the first minister Mirek Topolánek on occasion of the day of the celebrations official Czech presented the new official recording of the hymn where my home.

Blohlávek considers this national Czech edge as one of the most beautiful tunes. 
The Czech Radio already said before deliberately chose for the Alone singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and more popular. 
"From the outset I have, also tried with both and afterwards, with the Chorus that noticed the diction so that the text was well comprised, so that it had consonance," it commented.

Those that start to use the internet as a way of trade, can start definitely to forget the posts of sale of tickets in the stations Metro, where until now they owed regularly to make queuing a ticket normal to be taken. 
The bond is bought in the Internet, and they recharge the card Opencard for you in one of the Thirteen subsidiaries of the. 
"In these places there is a window with prepared staff availably of the passengers that it helps the ones interested with the purchase by the Internet and also with the reload of the bond bought in its card", it said the spokesman of the project, Martin Opatrný. 
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the Bono electronic in the Opencard in the automatic machines retailers that find in some vestibules Metro. 
How are they these vending machines? 
They are red, remember us to a machine of pricking notes and the travellers probably will already have noticed them in the stations of the meter of Roztyly, Budjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Now there is in the city five but at the end of year there should be eighty", completed Opatrný. 
The bond is controlled by the machine instead of the driver 
The use of the machine, which will start to work tomorrow, is simple. 
It is enough to introduce the card of chip Opencard in it and the previously paid bond will be loaded in it only. 
bonds Electronic from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings. 
That is, in the peripheral trains and lines of buses from the numbers 300 up to 499 that use mainly the inhabitants of the villages of bohemian central. 
"In the trains appointed to the transport integrated of Prague there are inspectors equipped with a card reader that will help confirm the validity of the time and the area of the bond", like this explained the control of the notes, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of transport public of Prague. 
Buses bypass have their cards readers gotten on in the tickets's driver. 
When entering is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but besides it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place stationed for that on the side of. 
With that, the driver controls the validity of Bono. 
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is not anything easier to request to the driver this information", completed Drápal. 
The passengers that do not travel in buses bypass and do not remember when it is them finishes the validity of Bono can be directed to machines vending where the cards charge up. 
Here, in the screen of the machine, the information will be shown to them on the validity of his document. 
The southeast wanted to be part of us. in a referendum 
Sudeten Germans the asked in 1945 that smoking were part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted from the card that is put away in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemia of the South. 
If we can not belong to Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the sponsorship of the United States of America. 
With this desire they were directed, presumably, some groups of Germans of the Sudetes to the president of USA. in 1945. 
It results from the cards that are put away in a file particular and that today are put away in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemia of the South. 
The Germans of eský Krumlov request in a letter to the American president that does not allow the return of him "earth Šumava" - occupied by Hitler following the Pact of Munich - of new to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want its word that the units American are arriving to German lands not as not even enemy oppressors but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with one "the people that it takes the destination of Šumava in its heart". 
In view that the union of Czechoslovakia with the southeast German presumably means - according to these the Czech national character - a hope alone in the brutality, inconsideration, incomprensión, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the president American that it assumes for today and forever To Šumava under a protectorate. 
"We can not think that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants delivers us to a foreign state that oppresses and refuses to the minorities and that it does not collaborate with the victory at all of the allies", is written in the letter. 
The reason why the authors can not sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of los "oppressors Czechs". 
If the president of USA. presumably it doubted on this idea about the sumavos Germans, would be enough to organize in the land a referendum about whether their inhabitants want to be part of the USA. or to live under its sponsorship. 
Even though the text the letter of, with the knowledge that we have current of the history of post-war, can sound us a little infantile, according to some specialists it paints succeededly the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of then. 
Although the Germans Czechs had to sense minimally that only some were going to be dealt on its expulsion of the Republic few admitted this possibility. 
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some form clear of autonomy for the Sudetes. 
Others thought that they will stay in Czechoslovakia. 
Even the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in eské Budjovice, confirms it. 
This was in the war, as German of Budjovice, enrolled in the navy of the Baltic. 
When at the end of the war the British captured it and tens of Germans summoned it in the field of prisoners steer they went to it so that Czech showed them. 
"They thought that when returning home, the Czech would come them well", said Chalupa. 
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to it, counted on following the Benes their being moved away from the Republic. 
You do not think - 
pays! Emotive campaign attacks the drivers 
The most expensive action in the Czech history directed to the safety in the roads. 
This could the emotive Campaign which the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media could be characterized. 
office of the minister, Ales ebíek promises that it will dissuade the drivers of dangerous behavior to at the wheel. 
campaign of 150 million television will be made feel in the television, radius, cinema the Internet and in brochures. 
It should dissuade the driver of the high speed and of alcohol at the wheel. 
And also to remember that before being started off the belts are tied them. 
It wants to arrive to the conscience especially of the conducting youngsters, motorcyclists, pedestrians and in last place also of the professional drivers. 
And what is what we can see in the advertisements? 
Fundamentally human histories that charge to the emotions. 
and for that they testify it to us the advertisements "sanguinary" durante throughout the campaign: 
You do not think - 
pays! word the You do not "think" is written with big letters in registration. 
and in a pond of blood it is the word "pays". 
This must symbolize that the man in a time of diversionary can get to pay with their own lives. 
The advertisements go to "put fear" to the spectators until 2010. 
The Ministry was let inspire strong images of victims of accidents by the campaign carried out in land Anglo-Saxon where they can be observed. 
He promises that this way it will reduce the accidents and the number of dead men in the Czech roads. 
The advertisements have been RSCG elaborated by the agency Euro. 
Sugar and whip for drivers 
"For the drivers it costs the system of sugar and whip. 
Azúcar is for it when, for example a light is passed in red and like this saves time. 
The whip is threat of fine or accident. 
The drivers must be reminded them the risks ", the psychologist of transports of the hospital says Na Homolce, Martin Koán. 
and that's why an informative campaign is necessary in the press and mainly a publicity negative, specifies the psychologist. 
Less cash, for it, is the panels that warn the driver about the dangers. 
"If there is some panel installed soon warning about any danger probably will be fused with the environment and the driver will not lend it bigger attention", noticed Koán. 
Olmert would return almost all the areas occupied in exchange for the peace 
By the temporary prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert east Jerusalem was pronounced on the restitution practically of all the lands occupied in 1967, that is, West Bank, this and the High of the Golán, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria. 
It suggested in the interview that on Monday appeared in the journal Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians what means that necessarily we will have to return almost all the lands (occupied) whether it is that not todas", told Olmert to in the newspaper. 
"Insurance that we will keep a both per cent of these lands, but to the Palestinians we will have to hand over them a for a hundred resemblance (of the land of Israel) because without this there will not be peace", added. 
He admitted that in the event of restitution would be included also East Jerusalem this. 
"The one that wants security in Jerusalem and therefore it does not want for the tractors or bulldozers to pass above their legs as it passed it to one of my best friends, then will have to turn in a part of Jerusalem", noted Olmert with reference to the two attacks of July in the city in which there were several deaths and tens of people were hurt. 
As the president will be necessary find "join special solution for the Hill of the, sacred place and historical" that is found in the within old city. 
"The one that wants to maintain the sovereignty Israeli in throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
This "will not" work ", insisted further on. 
Withdrawal of the High of Heights Golan 
Olmert was pronounced also by the withdrawal of Israel of the High of Heights Golan what from their point of view is an inherent condition to close a agreement peace with Syria. 
But this would mean also some specific efforts on the part of Damascus. 
"I do not suggest closing the peace with Syria only in the basis of the withdrawal of the Golán", warned. 
"The Syrians know well what they will have to transpire from to gain the Golan. 
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, will have to abandon its relations with the Hizbulá (chita movement), will have to detach of the permanent support that provokes the terrorism of Hamas (chita movement), of TO Qaeda (the network terrorist) and of the Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq ", specified the prime minister. 
Questions after the accident: Are the stewardesses illegal in the buses? 
The law is not known, can not be walked in a bus long-distance 
In relation to the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova the question rises up from whether the hostesses and passengers can move for the bus during the journey us. 
"If we wanted strictly and formally to comply with the law the activity of the hostess is opposed the law transit avenue", says the spokesman of the ministry of Transporte, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in which the hostess of 22 years died last week, evidently was only caused by the driver of the truck that the bus crossed in the path. 
The girl, unfortunately, was seated next to the driver in the place less sure of the vehicle despite having other two sites reserved. 
However the bus can have an accident or stop in a sudden way, and in the precise moment in which the azafato divides up the coffee or the newspapers. 
Here what the role plays is whether the bus is found endowed, according to the licence technical, with places of on foot. 
If the bus is not standardized the passenger must go sitting. 
The buses of long distances from Student Agency do not have places to go standing, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Janura, to Aktuáln.cz. 
"This there are it solved with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers not is allowed. 
Finally this they withdrew it and arrive to the agreement that the passengers can go to the toilet being the bus in progress if it is that they have seat ", commented to us on their position. 
The hostess does not know the law 
"There is not an evident legal interpretation of the paper of the hostess - no provision legal clarifies this role. 
Or even any provision legal forbids the carriers to carry out some service. 
The law of transport by road only knows the term of Inspector of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not "defined", adds, less sharply, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
On the contrary the director of the department of Traffic of vehicles for road of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law attends enough to this problematic. 
"The allowed standardization depends on whether the bus has to have sites of on foot. 
That is totality ", says. 
Buses the are divided up among the urban ones, where there are places to be standing and of limited speed limit, intercity with places to be standing with greater licence speed and those of long distances without places to go standing, with the greatest permission of speed and with the seats equipped with safety belt. 
As in the airplane, he says the expert 
The expert of BESIP in Safety in the transport, Jaroslav Hoín, does not see major problems as for the movement of the azafato in the bus. 
"During the development of the trip there is not a lot of threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service in aircraft. 
Not even here it is had the safety that the turbulence arrives and that the hostess can be hit in the head. " 
"However, if the bus stops in a sudden way evidently that the physical laws are valid. 
The same as in an urban bus or in the tram. 
safety of the hostess the must solve it the internal regulation of the carrier ", says and also thinks that from the point of view of law this problem is without solving. 
Janura is prepared to nullify this service 
Student Agency is the only one carrier that offers the service of stewardesses. 
He employs two hundred in it. 
Does the director, not even after the accident, consider this work risky. 
"However, in the moment in which it has the impression that the post of hostess is risked, then I will suppress it. 
The coffee and the newspapers can receive it, the passengers, when entering. 
It would save even expenses ", says. 
In interest to safety it is the reason why Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who directs a small line in comparison with SA. 
"We do not have stewardesses, we are against them from the outset. 
Before or afterwards this will finish in one fatal injury ", said less than a year ago for Týden.cz. 
An enormous tragedy happened 
In the accident of the line that it joins to Naples a young hostess of Pilsen a fortnight who had worked for the company two years died. 
A Slovene truck that probably he turned from the parking lane blocking the crossing to the bus. without using the blinkers. 
Its driver tried in a rapid manoeuvre to avoid it, however, was startling with the side right-hand lead. 
Janura denies that they were the two places that are reserved for the rest of the hostess sold. 
"These places is not possible to reserve them for connections long distances, are blocked." 
The company has the intention of suing the driver of the truck. 
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of family of the girl the but she waits for the costs financial also for the part of the guilty one. 
of the law? 
Not, for now 
reform of the law the could bring greater precision on the movement of hostess at the bus in which since a year ago that thirty expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transport are working. 
"However, they have not arrived to any conclusion specific. 
They are not dedicated too much to the buses, but to more or to the system of points, speed limit in motorway and the use of mobile during the course, "it says the expert. 
"of the does not consider the activity of the stewardesses something that threatens in so important the safety of the temporary" the spokesman finishing Hanzelka, that the control of security in buses is competence of the police and the of Safety at Work. 
The expectation of Dusseldorf is based on Frankfurt 
In the card of the board of the Bank West LB for their colleagues do not miss big words. 
By the merge of the Unit of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA is been able form 'a central market of capitals of from group financial of Sparkassen' as the writing, published on Monday, says it 
Bank West the LB, breaking the ` I tackle of competence 'with sustainable capacity of benefits would enter in such a business. 
Besides a such merger can be a start for following merge in the field of banks regional. 
like this he gets to understand the text, when a board of management wants to show capacity to act in hard times. 
Because as before the West LB is found under enormous pressure. 
Not alone of the part of the European Union, but also of the federal institute of the surveillance of the financial services that not long ago has made clear the government of the Renania of the North - Westfalia that remains little time to find a solution. 
Already for sometime, also of part of Frankfurt, it is spoken a lot on the union of such a type between the bank DEKA, which the customers of Sparkasse know through its funds investment, and the West LB. 
To say truth, Franz Waas, the head of the bank DEKA, presenting the data afterwards of one half a the end of August left to know that it does not see any meaning in the merge of the bank, situated on Mainzer Straße street, with a bank regional as for example the Helaba or the West LB. 
But the board of directors of the DEKA, which now is composed by the banks regional and the associations of Sparkassen, ordered to board of management starting negotiations with the West LB on the common commercial activities. 
In this they could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it. 
Of course, the negotiations have just started, like this is said in the website financial. 
It is not the first time when it is about the consolidation in the area of Sparkassen appears the name of the bank DEKA that with their 3000 collaborators appears among more important businessmen in the website financial Frankfurt. 
In 2003 in a time the situation seemed so the bank DEKA could fuse with the bank regional Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba. 
This initiative of creating a union of three parties remained without results. 
As soon as the plans were made public the government of Hesse expressed itself against the participation of the Helaba in this project. 
other two banks did also not find the same language. 
Instead of that the bank regional the Rhineland-Palatinate of started the talk with the bank regional. 
But people played always of new one with the idea about merge of the bank DEKA with other banks regional. 
but finally Günther Merl, the president of the board of management of the Helaba, expressed that it was against of the plans of coexistence with their bank. 
Independent of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks of the area of public law is necessary. 
Then, when they are going to pass the choices of parliament of Bavaria, the union of the BayernLB with the bank regional could do progress. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily a good news. 
If the pressure to keep fusing will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to carry that out. 
In the south the bank could be alone a young member, although until now it stood out much better from the financial crisis that the properties of Stuttgart and Munich made it. 
Of another part the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse - Turingia, which has 85 per cent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year prevented the plans of coexistence with the West LB. 
In any case the Nord LB remains alone. 
but such thoughts geo-strategic form are alone a part. 
Of another part it is about the compatibility the various models banking. 
In June Merl did a basic question on a commercial model that could guarantee the future for the banks regional, to that the deutsche Sparkassen- and Giro - Verband until now did not give no response. 
In end the West LB can decompose, but that, is naturally not the desire for of the bank itself. 
Thus, also in the card of the board of the bank it is said that it would be tried to find a complete solution for all the bank 
As the coexistence among singular parts of the bank with the DEKA can be combined, that is going to show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest it is known as "the weekend of the Italians" 
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth. 
but this time, to it Elena attends it as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, it says.

And now they all go to the Oktoberfest. One, to mark the path, ties the hats yellow in the trees, road signs and even in a poster of the choices of a big People's Party of Bavaria. 
It is wanted to be able to recognize the way behind.

The nights without sleeping for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate 
The banking system of Germany is relatively stable, highlighted alone last week the federal minister of Finances Peter Steinbrück. 
That well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German bank area will also be affected of the critical trends. 
and that has happened afterwards of weekend. 
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the financier of properties of Munich, which is appreciated in the index DAX, receives an appropriation of billion of a consortium of banks German to be able to make resistance to the turbulence in the market. 
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told to Reuters: the credit help rose up to 35 a billion euro. 
The part of the asset that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to show interest. 
The money originates as of the private banks also from those of public law. 
The cause of that are the leaks of the subsidiary Depfa. 
According to a report, the state financiers with the money that was lent for the projects long-term financed them alone a brief period of time - what now, because of the mistrust in the markets, is not more possible. 
In the first half of the year the reservation of capital of's bank cash in there is also the fee of the own asset fallen by 95 per cent 2.37 million euro postponed a little of 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent. 
In comparison with the same period last year the continuous admissions of financial investments and profits net of financial operations they fell up to the zero, the admissions of imputation for debtors and some bonds of values also the ones of the dissolution of provisions of the credit businesses laid out downward of more of 70 per cent, in 5 million euro. 
Alone thanks to the high and many admissions of the reimbursement of the expenses of compensation of the restructuring of the ex-group Depfa as well as to the reimbursement of interests according to the federal code of tax and to the businesses organized for companies of the consortium, the balance negative could accuse a deficit with approximately to 16 per cent more. 
After its privatization in 1990 the former financial state at first got lost in speculations with the industrial loans for the properties, which acted as reason for foundation of the bank Aareal. 
As he could not earn a lot money with the financing of the projects state, the Defa started to dedicate itself intensively to the projects in the area of infrastructure and of the financing of the projects community by investors private and like this as governmental (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified. 
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to carry out repayments on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential effect material" envelope the consolidated account of losses and gains of the group, is said very imprecisamente. 
It is a fact that they have canceled the dividends. 
They were already for 2007 canceled at two thirds. 
After the acquisition of the Depfa el Hypo Real Estate it converted in an important state and financial financier in the area of the infrastructure. 
As the bank does not have the customer it deposits, in comparison with other banks, it is to be more dependent on the refinancing in the market system. 
With the bankruptcy of the American merchant bank Lehman Brothers, what has happened two weeks ago the granting of loans interbank went down essentially because the banks were saving its liquidity. 
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 a billion euros to finance a part of wallets of loan of the Defa of their measures short-term for the refinancing. 
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate the bank covers with a loan the need for the financing of the group for a brief time and the company is assured of "him influence of the international money markets that now are essentially not suitable for work" 
Others sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed up to the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, the president of the board of management of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable future. 
bank central German the and the federal institute of the surveillance of the financial services (BaFin) set off from the base that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now is guaranteed. 
That have that the stockholders and creditors of the bank to wait. 
But because of the dynamic and of the imponderables of the crisis there is not evidence. 
Even it is imaginable that the financing does not have to be needed in its volume full. 
But the case can not be excluded. 
It ran the voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, that's why the salvation temporary neither can calm down at least worried people. 
The price of action fell at 75 per cent, 3.30 euros. 
On the contrary courses of loan are real well. 
Whereas the debts priority do almost not change, the courses of the borrowings according to the position in the land registry lay out clearly downward. 
Affected loans of the former subsidiary are especially Württemberg Hypo and with the right the borrowings whose challenges go beyond 2009. 
After the remarkable growth of the crisis banking and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the present value of its borrowings that before were an investment for speculation has to be considered as shop assistant of the stability of the international system financial. 
Whereas the issuing banks, the governments and the banks that are little affected still are ready to support the system, meanwhile it can be set off of the amortization of pensions inside of term. 
Or something is going to happen, what is not risked to imagine anybody - the financial crisis is going to surpass in next 15 months. 
But when seeing the crossed news on the partial estatización, the safety that is already in its limit now turned into a justified expectation. 
That is going to be a reason, because the creditors will pass the nights without sleeping, breaking the head on the decision on its isolation of enthusiasm. 
The short-term investors can still put the point final and use the transport to afteraccount of the leaks for next payments of taxes of compensation of profits on the change in the future. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent? - Box 
- Box When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop 16-year-old girl, had to present himself in the Highschool de Tachibana the girls started to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"! 
What means that? 
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she counts Japan. 
"The first day in a college in Japan. 
I felt nervous. 
Already before going to the school had afraid. 
Alive at the edge of Tokyo in the address Kawasaki and I leave by train 40 minutes to the Highschool Tachibana. 
Alone had that to find the path, for fortunately I did not get lost. 
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony. 
Of eight in the morning the pupils come, to the nine less twenty starts a small meeting with the professors, the 'home room'. 
That it started the class, to me it had gone to present myself. 
Besides I am not person who speaks by far taste in the public, especially in the face of a class of 40 pupils. 
As they still have the uniform school I put on an old skirt of the mother of my family host and besides a blouse, socks blue and shoes black skin. 
Then, like this dressed I put to the pulpit and I tried to pronounce everything in way right: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana." I am called Sylvana, I am of Germany and in a week it will be my birthday. 
Now I was very happy because already since two years ago it had started to study this language. 
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and done distinguishing marks and all the time I have listened to the word "kawaii" 
He already knew it of my Sleeves. 
That belongs to the vocabulary of survival of girls Japanese and means "monkey, borders" 
Afterwards I slid quickly in my place. 
girl to hand the had a smile big, for it was an honor that girl of Exchange had to sit next to it. 
The rest of the class was quite calm, but when the gong was familiar, I felt really assailed. 
All talked at the same time, laughed and did many questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
Afterwards in the recreational all took his Benthos. 
The mother of my family host also did a Lanchbox for my - another is something than gotten sick of pieces of bread Germans. 
rice with herbs had, small sausages, salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and something as meat in mass of tofu. 
In majority of cases I do not have even idea about what as here in Japan. 
The things are strange and have a taste new. 
What is safe is that everything is very rich. 
Then, maybe except for marinated plums in the salt, bufff! 
In the Japanese schools the benthos are not simply a lunch. 
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in way very artistic to a boy and gives it to him in expectation to be able to know it better during a recreation. 
On that I read in my Sleeve - Manga-Comics. 
I have a lot of curiosity to see whether I can see it also here. 
"Why precisely Japan?", my friends have asked me when I told Tokyo that it wanted to go them the school to attend a year. 
Then he always answered: 
"Good, because it fascinates me. 
Finally since years ago I prefer reading sleeves. 
To be able to understand better the comics and the culture a day I started to study a little of. 
For me it was absolutely safe that one day I am going to travel there. 
Also because I have one skinny for tradition and habits. 
Here they have a great value. 
Of a part Japan is a country the latest technologies and of trends, of other hand it is, a country harsh disciplined and traditional. 
As everything is well organized, yet I did not feel lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city that I have seen ever in my life. " 
Also the rats have feelings 
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger runs away, why also has fear? 
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the area of the neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings. 
How can it be controlled if they, behaving in the mode similar to us, sit the same? 
In a magazine of the Internet call "Edge" desde many years are published the contributions of scientists famous. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents the chosen answers to the question in a series What do you think what is truth without power to try it? 
I think that the animals have sensations and other states of conscience without that I or somebody another could prove it until now, not even although we can prove that other people have conscience. 
but in this case at least we can wait it because everything the human brains present the same shape fundamental. 
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions on the feeling and in general on the conscience, we enter the area not known because the hardware does not coincide. 
When a rat is in the danger, he makes the same as animals other: the dead is done, it runs away or it attacks. 
The people behave in approach similar, of what some scientists make conclusions on comparable experience subjective. 
Naturally I do not think it. 
aspects of the structure brain do difficult to contaminate our experience subjective to that of the animals. 
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by the human conscience of the lateral prefront lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of its participation in the memory short and in the executive functions that direct conduct). 
This wide part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and it seems that it is lacking absolutely in other creatures. 
Taking into account at least the aspects referred to our conscience that depends on the prefront lobe of the crust brain, among them knowledge on the one who we are and the skill of planning and deciding, there is a reason to mean that even the man differs from the other primates. 
One another peculiarity is found in the nature of man: As the majority of his experience is joined to the language, that often means that the conscience depends on it. 
In this case the animals can be excluded. 
But even though the conscience did not depend on the language, it would influence it so the conscience of the animals, created comoquiera, in many cases would differ from most of our states of conscience. 
that's why it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works. 
If that, as a little interesting and subjective, is not even let measure because it has the hardware special, nor it is let analyze through our experiences, like this their research presents us great problems. 
Most of my interventions are referred to the content of experience the allows, but at the same time there is also one another aspect of the conscience that should be easier for the research scientific. 
The processes of conscience of the animals could be investigated without taking their content into account, and that is what it passes during the studies of short memory of primates, especially in the example of the display. 
but with this approach that Christof Koch followed and Francis Crick what is essential rather passes to the neutral correlatos of the conscience that to the mechanisms causal: Both can be similar or not. 
curiously this approach highlights the importance of the prefront lobe of the crust brain for the formation of the display. 
And what results from that for the sensations? 
I owe to the fact that in the system emotional is activated a part of the brain that is responsible for that, how same happens with the fear. 
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain takes up a space of the system defence (or their consequences as for example the reactions of the body). 
Seen of this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the crust brain what distinguishes to primates and especially to the man. 
Of Point view of the nature of they follow rankings of the sensation fine because we can differentiate and to classify the states with help of the words and of grammar to describe the states of others at couple of ourselves. 
For example Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, it thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the crust brain responsible by the feelings Corporal and of the syllabus of brain, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but it concentrates more on the syllabus brain. 
As this network has not changed a lot during the evolution human, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations. 
For teoréticas reasons I can not go against that, but I consider it not probable. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that is sat in two cases well as: But how can it be controlled if rats and men behaving similarly feel the same? 
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, then because it has afraid? 
I am of opinion that similarity of behaviour still does not prove the similarity of experience. 
That is true that the comparison neural helps: rats and men have similar trunks of brain, the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least a brain. 
Is the one that is responsible for sensations the core of the brain? 
Even if it is possible to try it for the men: How it is been able to try it in the event of rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also the cockroaches (who knows it?), have sensations. 
but I do not know it how it can try it. 
I prefer investigating behaviour emotional of rats that sensations emotional because their sensations are supposedly distinguished fundamentally of us (because the consciousness human is referred to circuits special and to the language). 
In any case the breakthroughs in the area of neurology are waited for here as long as the same of rats and of men is measured. 
As I do not investigate the language and the conscience of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know it if they exist. 
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer advancing that permanent without results to work. 
Then well, I am practical emocionalista. 
The president of the UEFA Platini: period of grace for the Poland and the Ucraina 
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations soon would carry out under the direct responsibility of the president and of prime minister. 
"government the watches the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as the proof of confidence of the ability of the Ukraine to organize championship of Europe together with the Poland", said Wasjunik.

Possibly the number of the stadiums is going to be reduced of eight to six. 
"We can not waste more time. 
Now we have to carry out work with big speed ", the president of a partnership said Ukraine Grigorij Surkis. 
"The UEFA is not going to take away the eyes of us. 
In Poland a step more radical was agreed on. 
After numerous scandals the Olympic Committee of Poland suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and it replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission met at the request of the minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of following the rules", said Drzewiecki to the Polish news agency PAP. 
"In a letter we have assured to the president of the UEFA Platini that the preparation to the championship of Europe of 2012 is not going to suffer from that." 
Alone in the last season many teams in the first division were condemned because of manipulation in decline to the inferior, finally the Council of division had to be postponed.

She knew the size of its they have been unfaithful only after divorce. 
The motif of the disclosure of things private was the work of Ryan with the press for its new film "The Women" - a history of the failure of a marriage is told. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to the designation of it as a husband infidel was clear: This is "unprecedented that Meg few Times it has tells the story them of our relation in one another version", told the man of 54 years "To New York Daily News". 
Among other things it is very "regrettable" that Jack, her son of 16 years, again "goes to remember in public the pain and the changes, all what means a divorce for a child.

The prices of the notes of tickets and of hotels are going down 
In the first half of 2008 the notes of airline tickets and the overnight stays Europe were cheaper comparing those of the last year. 
According to a study current, the notes of airplane in Germany were done cheap even 50 per cent. 
tickets services and the overnight stays in hotels were done again cheap - this are results of a study of the supplier of services travel services and of the financial services of American Express. 
company the has analyzed its data of reservación of the first half of 2008 and after the increase of the prices in the first quarter found out a great change in the second half. 
That during many years the prices in market of hotels kept increasing the overnight stays in many places were done cheap. 
In comparison with last year, between January and March the prices in 41 of the 48 cities different of Europe increased for average to 6,9 per hundreds. 
Of April until June the prices already brought 3.6 per cent down comparing last year. 
The trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where the travellers had to pay less than the previous year. 
According to American Express, the reason of that was the course of weakened dollar, the that it was the cause of that "the interests of the American tourists in traveling decreased." 
The decrease of the prices of the hotels is also made notice much more in the financial centers as Frankfurt or London than in the points of industrial concentration as Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the city Norway the prices of hotel increased to 26,3 per cent and like this beat a record in Europe. 
In the first quarter the prices of notes of tickets also showed trends upward: 
Because of the increase of the prices of kerosene the travellers of the class Economy had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more that in 2007, the flights long-distance even were done more expensive up to 29,2 per cent.

Of January until February the prices increased to 11,9, in the second half they brought down 23,6 per cent. 
According to a study, the prices for flights domestic in Germany even reduced the half. 
The cause of change in prices is of a part the increase in economy weak the, explains the company. 
In many parts of the market of travel with the plane the demand is going down. 
Of other hand there is big competence for the treaty of Open-Skies that liberalizes the traffic of airplanes among the USA and Europe.

The HSV wins against Gladbach 1: 
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg converts in the leader. 
Luhukay de Borussia to it does not go out yet to do the eleventh goal. 
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the emergency landing of the player of the selection national Marko Martin. 
The player of Gladbach started to play late and failed doing a goal. 
all what meant exactly reacting to the happened, it could be read clearly of their lips. 
Alone knew that was right. 
"We need a second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger in the entry of booth of the stadium of Hamburg. 
I do not pass anything special in the catacombs, the time of rest it finished and most of the present ones was again in their websites. 
Rieger was almost for three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, takes pleasure very big reputation as one of those that formed a part of the group. 
By that his request was noticed of one presents responsible. 
Cornelius Jol the coach assistant agreed with the head and lifted the fingers as a sign of approval. 
Cornelius is brother of Martin Jol the coach main of Hamburg. 
Its order was it: The second goal, goes! 
but that was not carried out. 
"Today not everything was nice of seeing", added afterwards Marcell Jansen. 
Also Bastian Reinhard had wanted to have it "more relaxed". 
The result 1 0 (1 0) Hamburg has that to be grateful to Mladen Petric (11) with its impact of head; and also to the situation that the equipment of Gladbach very weak could not show all its force to the weak team of Hamburg. 
"That was a victory dirty", said summarizing Martin Jol. 
This Monday the SV of Hamburg is going to celebrate its 121 years. 
On Saturday the of will be the spectators had already celebrated his same, the blue sky on the stadium and the change of board in the screen of video. 
It is going to be a birthday without a party real. 
"We know to interpret me", said Marcell Jansen. 
It foresees that the partial qualifications of the table correspond to the hint of the league more than to the dominance of its HSV. 
The quipo with its players obliged late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as Jansen that it was removed from FC Bayern need time to be joined, but yet the quipo can not shine with its successes. 
"We need more of feeling and of the dribbling", requires Jol.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of the probes space 
Since many years ago a phenomenon mysteries cause the disturbance to the investigators: the Dark Matter influences the speed of the probes space during like this called gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre. 
The experts fear the Theory of Relativity of Albert Einstein not being able to be so correct. 
The space probe "Ulysses" passed almost 18 years flying in the universe. 
Because of the pipes fuel being frozen now it threatens it one death in the cold. 
Since years ago a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the assistance gravity to the manoeuvre, provokes the confusion among researchers. 
assistance gravity the is a maneuver of the trajectory of the space probes during that they obtain an acceleration using the energy of field gravity of a planet, for example of the Earth. 
That allows the space probes to save fuel. 
Cassini-Huygens, the probe space eu-usa used this trick physical as well as the probe of the Sun Ulysses made it. 
but the that surprise to researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave for 100 per cent as well as it waits for itself for it according to the venerable law of the gravitation. 
They rather frequent irregularities of speed. 
Unexpectedly the probes has greater or lesser speed. 
The physicists could not explain this effect until now. 
They called it the anomaly during the assistance gravity to the manoeuvre. 
Some experts fear possibly even the general Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein that describes the strength of attraction of the field by the curvature of the area not being able to be so correct. 
Stephen Adler an the physical American of the Institute for Advanced Study de Princeton creates solemnly now as before that Einstein did not confuse and it tries to explain the anomaly during the assistance gravity with help of like this Matter called Dark, in what the astronomers remained in the universe. 
"reason for the anomaly the can be the Dark Matter that can also be very near to the Earth", he writes. 
Researchers in the universe know the existence of alone since ten years. 
Supposedly it has the strength of attraction and its influence can be observed in others planets. 
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, what means that it does not send and does not reflect any radiation electromagnetic is completely invisible, especially any light visible. 
According to the calculations of the scientists the Dark Matter does at least one fifth of the mass total of the universe. 
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
As it confirmed the minister of foreign affairs of Italy, after passing ten days in the hands of hijackers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released. 
The kidnappers of Sudan had demanded millions of rescue. 
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release. 
Five Germans are kidnapped in the south of Egypt. 
Negotiations with regard to the rescue already started. 
Germans the always fall of new one in the point of attention of the kidnappers. 
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells on the cases most important. 
For what has been seen the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released. 
On that the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the broadcasting station of the Arab television Al-Arabija and the Italian media.

'Now we control his state of health ", said Frattini. 
Germans five, five Italians and a Romanian as well as his eight guides Egyptian are well and are in the safety, informs the Egyptian state television. 
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are in the way to Cairo. 
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian guard of security the kidnappers were ready to finish with the kidnapping, but the army of Sudan had suddenly killed hostages kidnappers. 
"The problem was solved. 
They agreed with the ransom ", said the guard. 
It was treated alone of "the hostages receiving" this surprise "when it suddenly arrived. 
On Sunday the Sudanese soldiers have killed six hijackers and to two of them have person under arrest in the border area among Sudan, Chad and Egypt. 
The kidnappers have demanded the rescue of Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money had to turn in the wife German of one of the hostages. 
The journal "The Masri El Jom", being referred to a mediator German, it informed that the release was delayed because the kidnappers had afraid of their safety. 
According to the report the kidnappers have the intention of releasing the femeniles hostages after having received the rescue. 
The men had to remain arrested until the kidnappers had a route safe to run away. 
The embassy of German in Cairo rejected to take the position with regard to this report. 
Abuse of stepfather "took to the suicide" 
According to the court, years of abuse for their foster parent took a woman to kill to themselves same. 
Michael Trerise 57 years, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been condemned at five years of prison after it accepted eight charges of assaults indecent. 
The Real Court of Truro, across an indagatorio study, knew that it regularly had bundle to its daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl had among five and seven years. 
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: "I feel responsible for his death. 
court on knew that the Sra Randle committed suicide in its home of Mutley in Plymouth, on 1 of April of the 2007, at 34 years of age. 
In the season in which the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise got used to tie it and to bandage the eyes for her before carrying out their acts sexual, whereas his mother was working in a pub. 
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise went back to live in Cornwall. 
Its stepchild was transferred to Plymouth. 
However the court knew that the Sra Randle, that used much of her time working twice as voluntary for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted it per week. 
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of the Sra Rande had said of it, who after having been a great a surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if "it" had "renounced the life." 
In April 2007 its real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in his apartment in Plymouth. 
It is supposed that the Sra Rande has killed to itself suffocating through a bag plastic. 
The Sr Randle confronted the stepfather of its daughter, who wrote a card of confession that concludes saying: "I it used to tie it and to be it the eyes. 
It was never a sexual assault. 
I sit responsible for his death. " 
The judge Christopher Elwen answered to Trerise: "You are a abnormally attached very strange, and for his victim you must have been a dreadful experience, especially when you had only seven years. 
unpleasant saga finishes with the victim taking off their own lives. 
Still clearer, is that if it had not done it, the issue would probably not have finished in the courts. " 
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description done by the father and the mother of Stephanie the abuse there was on his daughter over the years. 
clearly she would have been able to have a future promising, of success and happy. 
An officer loaded by the loss of data 
The BBC was informed that an officer of the Cabinet that forgot some documents secret in the train in June is going to be accused by virtue of the Law on the official secrets.

The societies of Building confront the price of B & B 
In Great Britain thousand pounds could be confronted with a price of more than 80 by the societies of building after the ransom / rescue of the bank Bradford and Bingley. 
The Government, in effect, provided 14 trillion of pound sterling to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers's bank. 
interest on the loan the will be paid by all the companies that use the money of the thrifty, the 59 societies building included. 
The chief operating officer of the Association de las Sociedades de Construcción (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that the societies and their members have that to pay 
Eventually, the loan de14 billion should be paid back afterwards that the mortgages of Bradford and Bingley are redeemed to. 
However, the interests that are entitled to in the meantime, are meant full every year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits. 
The Plan of Compensation of the Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 societies building are included in that number. 
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudently... be called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been a lot less prudent. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
That is that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the societies of mediation had to pay 18% of cost approximately. 
The Treasure estimates that interest on the loan will promote thousand pounds to 450 in 2009. 
This entails that the societies will have to recover 81 a thousand pound sterling to confront the first year of interest. 
Adrian Coles, chief operating officer of the Trade Association of the Societies of Construction, declared to the BBC that this situation is unfair. 
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudence in the growth of the market property are called to pay the price produced by those that were a lot less prudent." 
According to the BSA, there are not data that indicate the failure of any society since 1945. 
"We will have the need to examine all the aspects of this matter in the next weeks to find out what options there are to protect the societies of building and to its members in front to what could be a price relevant," added Mr. Cole. 
interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year up to that of March. 
In 2010, it will be a complete year of requirable interests, which will be able to be almost twice more. 
Being the mutual societies of building organisations and there not being stockholders, its members will finish inevitably paying the price, or to through higher fees or interest lower in their savings.

Its defenders said that the court did not grant it the release on bail accusing it of extorsion of 50 million taka (729.700) to an entrepreneur when it was First Minister. 
This is one of the several accusations of corruption at his office. 
Its political competitor of long tempo Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of this month. 
By the return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh it is meant being in the coming weeks, but its match, the League Awami, has demanded that government of the, suportado militarily, grants first complete freedom to him.

Its lawyers say that they will do an appeal before the High Court against the order of the. 
"The High Court refused the request of bail to Sheikh Hasina holding that it could not obtain the why release on bail any longer was in treatment abroad under probation," said its lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.

The Special Attorney Nora Dannehy is investigating if the civil servants questioned during the investigation have lain to the investigators in the attempt to hinder the justice. 
"complaints of possible behaviour criminal have not been completely investigated or resolute," the Glenn Fine states in the report. 
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a prosecutor special with the power to oblige the witnesses to leaving their statements. 
The discussion commenced when nine estadunidenses lawyers were mixed up of its charges for the Department of Justice in December 2006. 
In that moment the department motivated to the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed by low yield. 
but later it was known that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others their colleagues, and many observers took to the conclusion that you dismiss them would be motivated for political reasons. 
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, members of high profile of the, while others had refused to investigating allegations of fraud electoral against the Democrats. 
These lawyers investigate and judge the judicial cases for the government 
and they can be dismissed in any time, but can not be mixed up by political reasons. 
The successive head of the of, the General Attorney Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the redundancies, renounced his position. 
A certain number of other civil servants of the made the same. 
report of the Mr is very critical of the role staked for the Sr Gonzales in matter the, and underlines as it had join "responsibility primary" give birth the dismissals, that "abdicated" of their position of leadership and was "notably not colaborativo" in the process. 
Other civil servants, and among them Karl Rove the former collaborator of Bush, were criticized by not having cooperated with the research. 
The epic of Meat Loaf of a lot honors 
The star of rock Meat Loaf goes to be honored in the Q Awards for its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who will comprise the special prize the next week in the ceremony that will take place in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "an honor". 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the bond of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977. 
The group of Coldplay they are taking the nominations for the prizes of this year and doing the classification of the four categories. 
Paul Rees, editor - head of the magazine Q, said: There are some songs that spread time and gender, and is certainly one of them. 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity as the one that was used by Meat Loaf. 
section of almost two minutes opens the anthem. 
The song was known first as one single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and got to be number 15 in the classification. 
However, Bat Out Of Hell de Meat Loaf remained around nine years in the rankings and got to sell more than 40 million copies in all the world. 
Meat Loaf - name real Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered problems of health in recent years, including a surgical operation for his arrhythmia heart in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, an acute laryngitis obliged him to canceling some concerts. 
Later it rose that it had a cyst in its rope voice. 
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps early on sale 
The city of New York account with thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other ways, some famous ones, others simply of service. 
However, to many people, inclusas the veteran taxi drivers and the residents local longstanding dates, it is them difficult to indicate the location of the place, especially because many of them have never heard to talk about this street. 
small street the is in the East Village and is extended in the North of the Primiera Calle - before that I found the Seconda Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue. 
more of an way active is compared with a dusty alley by this callecita, more or less than 30 feet of breadth and 120 of long. 
There are not signs. 
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas. 
The street, however has admirers. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently has built buildings of luxury in the Primiera Calle 
that he wants to repave Extra Place and to create a corridor clean shops and boutiques which it is expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other fans include the neighbours of old dates that they commented to be delighted through the lane truncated simply because it is the appropriation of buildings one of the last remains of the past of the bloc before. 
However, the Department of the House, Conservation and Development of the city, which has the control of the street, does not have no interest in having it. 
In the meeting of the Committee of Community of Vencidad for the use of the earth that took place this month, the representatives of the agency Avalon sketched a proposal to buy the street. 
However, the committee, preferring to the city that the street remained, asked for a new plan that will be presented next month, as he said Susan Stetzer, the manager of district of the Community n.3. 
"The city is proprietary today of very few spaces and it would please us that it kept having Extra Place," said the Sra. 
"We can consider the proposals done by Avalon to solve the problem and to manage the area, but we also want to guarantee access public to the street. 
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and to install some seats, included to be used as coffee, in the waiting of renting the spaces. 
The idea that Avalon could buy street the rose up for the first time during meeting this month 
but Michele de Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, he not necessarily wanted to possess it. 
"The primary worry of Avalon Bay is renewal of this impasse abandoned the and the possibility to convert it in one public area," said, adding that the proposal of sale came of city itself. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of for the, confirmed that the idea of selling the street was a desire by the city and observed that mission the agency of the is the development of property the more than management this. 
In comparison with his surroundings more of color, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark in the history. 
Some think that he obtained its name in 1802, when the big estate of Philip Minthorne was divided up among their children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anybody. 
The back door of the CBGB, the monument of rock punk that closed in 2006, he abriba in Extra Place, but street the is maybe better known by the photograph of the store that goes out in the cover of the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia". 
"environment the was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, that took the photograph in November 1976. 
It "was full of rubbish, pieces of clothes and sane parts of barrels, posters, leaves." 
Some resident, the bloggers that write on the embourgeoisement of the East Village included, have been opposed the idea about selling Extra Place, arguing that the public goods, still modest that are, must keep being public. 
Others have praised Extra Place as strange part, practically without changes, a crack of the city that should be supervised. 
Jeremías Moss, that it directs a called blog Jeremiah 's Vanishing New York (I subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: To Bitterly Nostalgic Look at to City un the Process of am going Extinct"), has put availably part of a talk of the history of the city on Extra Place, published by the journal The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a cul-de-sac a little narrow and alley, dark also for the day and marked by doors of store of oxidized iron and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters." 
With few exceptions the streets seemed it more or less in a recent afternoon. 
A rat itself curía across the part behind of the street and the door that was used to enter to the CBGB and that now receives a store of clothes of luxury stopped near. 
on walls and a bottle of empty beer near 22 - oz were nearly one new set of discarded newspapers. 
Some assistants said that rarely they put attention in Extra Place, but they suggested that it would be been able to give him a cleaned. 
Mr fields the, on its part, noticed that some people underestimates the attractive power of the street in its state current. 
"I passed the best years of my life," said, "in dark places, humid and sickening." 
debate on bilingualism the: immersion in language 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and launch T.. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates on the education. 
It throws T.. Izumi, an old man associated in studies on the California and director of studies of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice." 
To call effectively to the Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals on the subject of education done by Barack Obama are the example of that. 
The campaign of by Obama writes down that "the Afro - American ones and the Latin students have significantly less probabilities of being graded than the white students," and this is a consideration very true. 
To fight such differences in the events of learning, the plan of education of Obama specifically advocates, among other things, "him bilingual education transitional" give birth the pupils - English. 
However, the question opened for Mr Obama is whether the appointment of the bilingual education, which prefers in classroom the instruction in languages other than, is effective in ring-shaped the distance in the results final. 
let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognized in the oriental region of the County of Los Angeles. 
In this school the immense majority of the students are Hispanic and of family with incomes it goes down: 
More than a third of students, many of which newcomers, are learning the English language. 
However, incredible 100 per cent of students the fourth year, has been evaluated positively in the examination of mathematics of 2008 
and almost one equally astonishing 93 per cent has dominated the proof of English language and arts. 
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that the favorido for Mr Obama. 
The school Sixth Street emphasizes the revision and practice the, the constant evaluation of the competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses. 
Besides, and here it is where Mr Obama should write down, according to Linda Mikels, the main one of the Sixth Street, the approach of the school for the instruction of English to the students is in the "total immersion". 
Immersion in English means the nearly exclusive use of language in the treatment of the contents of the investigation. 
The Sra Mikels, that it is opposed the bilingual education, said me, "have had extraordinary successes with students as this ultimate that has arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter in the classroom 12 months later you would not be capable of comprising what was. 
"Funciona," indicated, "us we create that it works. 
Take Mr Obama will a school as Sixth Street Prep as a model of replying through other schools with big Hispanics - English populations of pupils? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt on the answer, but the idea of the political of his broken up on the matter of the education (associations for the education have been defenders of education for long time) and his continued support for the dark the prediction of's response Mr Obama. 
Although it is that the immigrants must learn English, recently Mr Obama has trivialized the question leaving that the people should stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English 
and instead of that, it said, "you must make sure of its child being able to talk Spanish." 
If really the Sr Obama wants to improve the system and to close loopholes, he should consider carefully the models of education that, more to despise or to trivialize them, work well. 
price of oil falls brusquely after the renewed economic fears 
price of oil the came down drastically this Monday because of the worry that the American plan of rescue for the markets financial can not be capable of reactivating the economy. 
The actions of the crude oil decreased of 7 per cent arriving at 99,80 dollars a barrel in the negotiation of the morning in the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The price has gone down of more than 20 dollars for barrel since last Monday. 
In the past two weeks, the markets of commodity have been shaken by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching a maximum of 145,29 dollars for barrel in July, the prices had fallen at almost 90 dollars for barrel at beginning of this month, before uncertainty moving back, once again, because of the enormous one in the financial markets. 
The anxiety took hold of the investors, more once, on Monday, in spite of the leaders of the Congress that they said they had arrived to an agreement during the weekend on the plan of ransom, the biggest in the history. 
The news was seen darkened by new worries that the financial crisis would be far from finishing. 
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the process of merging, confirms that Citigroup will buy the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what he said the government this Monday. 
Meanwhile the governments Belgian, Dutch and of Luxembourg have partially the European financial conglomerate Fortis nationalized. 
The analysts in Barclays Capital said that, in the hectic weekend, the negotiations that drove to the agreement of ransom "seem not to have been able to reactivate the sense of the market. 
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is waited for in a trimming of demand for commodities, once the oil has been included. 
"The perspectives for the world equity the rate interest and of change they are going to be every time more uncertain," wrote the analysts of the Deutsche Bank in a note to investors. 
"We think that the commodities will not be able to escape from this infection. 
From the perspective of products, the ours concern more pressing is the evaluation if the virus American will be propagated at world level and specifically to China. 
analysts's bank have reduced their expectations for the next year, as oil consumption goes down because of the crisis in the economic growth and the forecast of reduction of the price of oil and of the gas is of 20 per cent for 2009. 
Second quarter of madness: team establishes record 
After having passed, during the last eight seasons, more time than anybody in the uniform one of Jets, playing in defence, Shaun Ellis I thought that it had seen everything. 
Then he saw things in the second quarter as they develop this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a match without annotation in a game of deflating. 
I have never seen at all as that, "commented Ellis. 
The second quarter initiated after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness under the gloomy ones of the clouds. 
Now it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found to Laveranues Coles carrying out a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the Harbinger perfect for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relation among the players had a great leap forward. 
Favre found to Cabbages for two goals more in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the half. 
"I did not go out of my way," said Favre of all the crossings that went to Coles. 
"He is a devil of a player. 
Our communication has been big, independently of what the people can think. " 
While Favre and Cabbages were had in the dam, the defense of the Cardinals ill-treated to the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a shot andante and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith puntó to another happens and intercepted it. 
Linebacker David Bowens was obliged to the mistake by Warner. 
In the last turnover, the mistakes obliged by Bowens, could have been the best. 
The Cardenals had taken the possession with 10 seconds available, and afterwards that the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely it gave a kick of 20 yards to gain one definite 34 - 0. 
They are the biggest points that the Jets never did in a fourth. 
To the coach of the team, Eric Mangini, ask it of describing the folly of this time, said: "second quarter the or the third quarter? 
When both - the Jets allowed 21 points without unanswered in the third quarter - were answered to him Mangini said: "I can say that I liked it much more the second quarter than the terzero. 
They have gained a heap of points in a very short period of time. " 
Gebrselassie rested leads his record world 
More once, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proved because many consider it the biggest corridor of history, surpassing his own record world in the marathon of Berlin Sunday on and deviniendo the first person capable of moving the career of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in the adaptable career in flat in 2 03 59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds its previous record of 2:04:26, obtained the year passed in Berlin. 
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a race of a length impressive so it has established a cup world or a record world for any distance, from the race against time up to the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part to the marathon olympic in Beijing, fearing - perhaps in too alarming, in retrospective - that air pollution worsened their problems with asthma. 
However, it was noted to run in Berlin. 
In conditions almost perfect - sunny and with 48 degrees when starting the race, 55 degrees in the end - Gebrselassie gained this Sunday, using in average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile. 
From when corridors of track as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat de Kenya have converted to long distances the record of the marathon has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo gives of Brazil improved on Berlin in 2 06 05 in 1998. 
After the victory of the last Sunday, Gebrselassie told the journalists that it had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks before and that it had wasted a week of training. 
It is evident that the suspension lent him fresco, not rusted. 
"I am very happy," Gebrselassie said to the journalists. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I started another time a week ago, and today I dyed some doubts, but in the end everything was well. " 
The athlete has been the target of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the Afro competitor - oriental of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much their careers, in general, avoiding meeting with many stars of the marathon worldwide, being based in the Pacemaker as if it were dealt of a track of career, and putting the record in front of sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not decrease the greatness of the skills of Gebrselassie as corridor. 
This Sunday, to the course of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race in 1: 
Two corridors of elite of Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, started to challenge to Gebrselassie afterwards that their pacemakers decreased. 
But little before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie caught a final impetus to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2: 36, improving its best personal record for almost five minutes. 
Kamathi arrived to third place in 2 07 48. 
In the feminine career, Irina Mikitenko native of Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a year remarkable winning in 2: 19 the seventh time fastest history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain possesses the record world of 2 15 25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko, of 36 years, was a surprise and gained the Marathon of London in 2 24 14. 
It neither took part in the Games of Beijing for what was described as an injury in the backs, but was recovered to improve on Berlin and to establish its best staff record in almost five minutes in the third marathon that moved. 
It did a career of calculation intelligent, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian corridors to do of head and, next, recovering them after 18 ½ miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia gained the second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop de Kenya finished of third in 2 25 01. 
In a city separately, the pride and the proofs of the life of colour 
Concealed for the expansion of the park to subject of the big one Orlando, at a few kilometres of the brilliant, vocal and colossal city, it finds a people calm, where the pride and the complications of the Afro - American experience remain very evident. 
Eatonville, the first city completely lived by black incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is not any longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 men of colour, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison. 
Now it is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to the Sra Hurston, the most famous writer of Renaissance of Harlem. 
And, however, in many meanings, the city that she described - making it caused by the Project of the Federal Writers of the season of the depression also a touristic stage through its inclusion in the guide travel - keeps being a place separately. 
city the is remained independent, worthy and deprived as it was it in the years' 30, when Sra Hurston wrote that the rural blacks in the Flowery often resistive to share their real ideas with the white man, that "knows so little on us and that it does not know what keeps getting lost. 
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, the senator Barack Obama, has caught the attention to start one I talk on the subject of race, many keep being cautious in front to the foreigner. 
"We are very cautious about the way in which our history is told," said Jones Hortense 59 years, one resident long-time and member of the most former church of the city. 
"It has to be correct." 
Eatonville from always has been defined a paradox of triumph and fight. 
It is to the same tempo a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of almost 2.400 people that live under a level of poverty double the average national. 
It is a centre literary, but also an example repaired of culture rural of South black - sometimes disdained, others praised - that it originated from the slavery in America. 
One may not it find strange, if those that live here are at the same time proud and reserved. 
To And the worry about the image of Eatonville really started for Zora, as nobody calls him Sra Hurston here. 
It introduced his hometown to the world through its profound books in dialect as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
paragraphs in the guide of the Flowery transformed the city just outside the 17, a road that runs across the centre of the Flowery often forgotten towards inside the history of blacks and the human drama. 
Having side of cement so much in the life as much as in the literature, the Sra Hurston took to its readers to the store of estate of the first mayor of Eatonville Joe Clarke, and afterwards inside more areas private. 
"Out of the road" by hand left, "wrote," has the modern school public marón with its finished white, its well maintained jardinos and courtyards of game, taken care of by Howard Miller, as it can hardly read and to be able to write. 
It also mentions to the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn reads "bandages drinks of all kinds and any sews leaves with rooms transitional." 
Therefore, only in some hundreds of words, the Sra Hurston puts, the second marriage and the sex, in relation Eatonville with the government autonomous, but also with the illiteracy. 
Evidently, this Fodor did not make it. 
In fact not everyone noticed the portrait. 
"Zora described it such cual outside," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that the Sra Hurston immortalized mentioning to men that kept singing songs without colour brings his beauty. 
He added: "Some people did not like them that." 
The Sra Hurston is still remembered here as a vigorous eccentric who went back frequently after his family was transferred to Jacksonville, in Flowery. 
by Franklin Augusto, 77 years, it is remembered that when the Sra Hurston arrived in city, it did it without previous notice in one big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that still today is proud of dressing with dignity. 
Most of the resident ones were remained fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcastically. 
"The people were always very glad of seeing to Zora," follows Mr Franklin. 
but, adds, being swung in its chair in a back courtyard with sight on the Lake Sabelia, where the Sra Hurston was probably baptized, "him it never remained too long. 
When the Sra Hurston died in 1960, it was poor and his books were not any longer in printing. 
As the majority of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although it was a star literary, one contemporaneous with Langston Hughes and the only woman of color in the Barnard College in the years' 20, was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Flowery, where it had been living. 
In Eatonville, there were not big ceremonies memorial or large readings public. 
"I do not think that their contribution to the world or its heritage were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped un Rainbows" a biography of the Sra Hurston published in 2003. 
true turning point arrived in the '80 of them. 
The civil servants of the County of Orange wanted to put a road of five lanes across the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main street of two lanes of community Labour. 
the expansion of the area Orlando already had pushed Interstate 4 the through the occidental edge of the city. 
The proposal arrived in a moment in which Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history. 
The integration forced, among other things, had put term to it relatively idyllic isolation of community. 
In los' 50, the struggle for mixing racial took the hatred approaches the community. 
"During this season, a group of boys white, went for the city throwing oranges and each thing against the people that were sitting nearby," said Mr Franklin. 
"They killed also a girl, once. 
They launched it against a watermelon of the car. " 
In a card of the 1955 to the Sra Hurston it wrote to the journal The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration for the High Court that, in Brown v.. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race." 
R Los resident say today that the desegregación of the schools positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and hollowed out the confidence of their young. 
"The black children were used to be embraced - I remember this - was gotten used to embrace the professor in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director preserves the Eatonville Community, an organization without ends of profit. 
This lasted, added, even that the professors and the students did not originate from the same place. 
"It did not keep embracing your professor because white éra - is a divide cultural there," said the Sra Nathiri. 
The civil rights, however, helped create the space for a lot of more Zora Neale Hurstons - writers black, actors and artists that passed above the prejudices, the same as did it, with buoyant, confidence and lines as: "How any can be refused to itself the pleasure of my company! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went up to the anonymous tomb of the Sra Hurston and started to fight to revive its reputation. 
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of the Sra Hurston done by Robert E.. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, re-introducing it in the American canons. 
project of the road the arrived exactly in the moment in which the most famous daughter of Eatonville went again under the spotlight. 
and this time, the old neighbors of the Sra Hurston saw it as a saviour. 
In 1988 the community started to plan a fair for the Sra Hurston to show what the county could ruin with this road. 
Thousands of admirers arrived to the event inaugural two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration. 
After several years the county has given up its proposal of road. 
"The idea revived of road to five ways Mrs, would have been to put in what you would call speed of curvature, a real civic pride," said the Sra Nathiri. 
The Sra Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved to Eatonville." 
The victory on the project of road the has helped change image of the same city. 
People outside city as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer that started to come to the church here in 1993, started to appear in large numbers, and the resident ones started to revise the past. 
Eatonville entered the in 1998. 
A new library (taking the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays, Eatonville keeps being an anomaly in Flowery: at only six miles of from the centre of Orlando, he can feel you, sometimes, as in a street of the past under a rain of summer, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(90 per cent of the people is black day today).) 
The foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are still often treated with caution. 
To Un license for anticipated is necessary to do the majority of the interviews, and some things - as the murals in the most former church of Eatonville, painted for a man white and showing black men that work in the field - they can not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a brave and convinced professor that has weakness for the red diamond, it still fears that their community island gives can be misinterpreted. 
And, however, as the festival Hurston has been extended, a higher level of pride home has also risen up. 
Young the, particularly, tend to see Eatonville to at the same way that the Sra Hurston saw entire its race: beauty, and all problems not better the, not worse, and equally to, other groups racial and ethnic in America proud creative hard-working stupid or mixed. 
It is a sincere public-spiritedness the that it can be heard it in the voice of the nephew of the Sr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, of 18 years, go it planned for Eatonville to return after the university to work in the local government or for the of, that said could need some help. 
And even those that two twin sisters of 11 years of Winter Park are younger, as Lark and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most of the people, in case that dare to go up to here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is not anything in comparison with any another'," says Alondra Kenon after going to the church on a recent Sunday. 
"but if really you give birth yourself and Tomas a moment to look to its history, is a city very nice." 
For here, in New York, they all talk ordinarily financial 
In the surface, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan kept far from the kiosks and from the gigantic screens of television in Times Square, they would not realize to be in the eye of the hurricane. 
They could never imagine that behind the façade of glass of the offices they are confronted with honeycomb that find above their heads, the bankers and the managers of speculative backgrounds that monopolize New York to daily basis with the worse "badly day of the office" desde the slump of 1929. 
Boys for the delivery home keep making their trolleys of metal resound for tea through the walkways and taking trays of muffins for meetings breakfast. 
Latin men follows dragging among cargodos buildings of apartments, as human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric colgandas printing to a yoke through their shoulders. workers office the still wait in queue for its food to lead from the morning, and it keeps being impossible to catch a cab among the 4 of them and the 7 of them in the afternoon on the work days. 
The employees wait for todavia making queue for its bagel to trolleys sellers of the vendedores, and todavia is impossible to find a taxi between the four and the five of the afternoon in the dias of the week. 
I looked alike as if there were not a crisis at all, even that, this Thursday in the afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there are, I have decided to open a new account of savings. 
Although had calculated the necessary time so that the operation coincided with the calm of the end of the afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase a queue of more or less 20 people it was already waiting. 
And not for in front of the window of the employee, to withdraw his effective or to make a deposit, but in front of the bank of customer services, where new customers order its check books of checks, the tourists look for instructions to go to the department stores of Macy and new customers want to open their accounts. 
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my "personal banker of confidence", and they were in queue for same reason as I. 
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn its savings of the smallest banks in places from where there were some commuted, places as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Island of Staten. 
They had drawn its money of the like this called associations of saving (a little as a society of construction), of the credit unions and of the savings banks of its natal city whose brancas only work in the state of belonging, and that they make out that they deal to the customers as to his family. 
During last year, 15 of these banks silently have failed. 
In the last days, Washington Mutual a bank with 327 a billion asset, entered in bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers went towards their homes on Friday at night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some deposits of savings of 440 a billion, kept looking for a buyer of rescue.

"I recruit the master out of scene to extract his caracter" Günther Bauer _ Photographer 
Neither not even flying heels nor costumes of debut. 
The essence of the big teachers of the Flemish, removed the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or the woman from. 
To a side the artist. 
To the other one, the person. 
Inseparable except in the privacy, in those times outside the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expresividad of some hands, disregarded because they are not going to go out to scene. 
The German Günther Bauer alternates the showmanship of some put on stage with singers, Temple and guitarists in "Flemish - people" with that hand less well known of these teachers. 
With this proposal the photographer collects the iconography individual of the Flemish from different areas. 
Included in the programming of the, the exhibition "reflects the importance international of the Flemish, bigger every day", explains the creator, the one who clarifies that "Flemish - people" can be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists in the scene. 
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting in passion scene, sorrow, joy... captivating the public. 
To collect the personality of these artists pictures of the scene do not have to be taken. 
They take your personality and character within. 
The that to my I showed interest was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to recruit with the house the personality of the big ones of the Flemish ". 
With the taste of the festival "Singing of the Mines", Bauer started in 1.997 a long journey to portray the cantaores, guitarists or bailaores with a house of plaque. 
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the House and of the material they remember the photograph classic. 
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classic base of the image, conferring modernity, idea that reflects how the Bauer itself understands the Flemish, on it: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and it surprises every day." 
It is not the action of the dance, of the singing or of the touch in itself, but the personality of the artist his character, that it captivates to the public with their art. 
The search of a meeting with what is essential, with the elf that is done visible in a way of feeling, of to be and of being have been and have been the constant of this work that presents itself these days in the gallery El Fotómata. 
Figures of the Flemish as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, known among another, configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists. 
The project has turned into an anthology of the Flemish, which soon will be published in a book that will collect the portraits exposed in the sample. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer took it to repeating the idea two years ago with "Portraits of sportsmen veterans" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flemish - people", the photographer admits that "it loves me portraying people, knowing them and his being able to enter a moment in his life, is a moment long or short. 
I think that in the photograph the portrait is gender more difficult. 
You meet or confront, characters, who sometimes you not even know, or who they leave you only some minutes to be able to take the photo, with people. 
In spite of these circumstances, as photographer, always try to bring about my ideas ". 
This collection of portraits of the current Flemish that it takes for "Flemish - people" bond is exhibited in the, once the 16th of October has been situated at number 20 of the street of the Bush, parallel to the Poplar Grove of Hércules, where even the next one will be able to be visited.

Being Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous lifting of Spaniards against the Frenchmen in Blood of May, the one that is the film more ambitious in its study of the film with approximately 15 billion budget. 
This way the film-maker has tried "illustrate the torrent characters of and the analysis social" that it has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the front of a wide list of interpreters. 
Blood of May, with a footage superior to the two hours and average, is used for the first time this Friday in the cinematographic rooms, to be converted in the future into a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration. 
Big fan of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures to have complied with this filming "a dream of childhood", that it must thank Expectation Aguirre, the one who from the Community of Madrid ordered it three years ago to film a tape memorial for the second centennial of the 2 of Madrilenian May, something that accepted always and when the story was based on the Episodes National. 
The 15 million budget that has contributed in its whole the Community of Madrid constitutes for Garci join "opportunity only" of to set with the decor and the clothing appropriate the portrait of "join Spain scatterbrained that it mistook head for whom to fight, since, the fight for independence took to the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", has noted.

Many of the interpreters with whom it coincides in Blood of May repeat before its cameraman, as it is the case of Miguel Rellán, of Carlos Larrañaga or of Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Candidate to the Oscar on four occasions - of which it gained one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent to Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood of May itself, Siete tables pong French and the finally selected one, Los blind sunflowers, do not represent to a young generation of the Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be given to knowing", has assured. 
With this film Garci he does not wait for prizes. 
"In the beginning you think that you work for the posterity, afterwards you realize only that you work for the prosperity, and now you adjust with doing a film more", explains Garci after more than 30 years of career. 
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia

Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and when it had three years was transferred to London with his family. 
She was a dancer of dance free and specialistic in oriental dances. 
It had an exciting life, pioneer of the women's liberation, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement women. 
The life of this woman who marked a dancística revolution and esthetics in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me and it seemed incredible to me". 
According to the bailaora, "we do not intend to say their lives but to comprise their spirit. 
The bonds of its dances have suggested sticks of Flanders to me. 
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos. 
Its dance was sensual and to my have said me that my dance is also in this esthetics ", states. 
The assembling has two partnerships exceptional: the one of Miguel Poveda that will sing again to Isabel in one in their performances, the same as it did in the of "La door open"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally has wanted to collaborate with the one who was its pupil. 
"Matilde makes the character of maturity, of Turtledove of bigger one. 
I am happy because he has agreed to acting in my work and feel very honest because of that ".

In the work the life of this woman that was developed in places as distant, especially for the time as India, United States, or Russia, is had also in some form besides of for across Europe, since it usually lay in London. 
"I have wanted to remember it because I think that it is of those women that have an enormous influence in a period particular and now nobody knows and it puts a lot less in value his work", states Bayón. 
The show will start off today the 20,30 hours in the theater Lope de Vega. 
The publication of the "Journal of a poet newlywed" closes also the Trienniumum 
The presentation of the first erudite edition of the "Journal of a Poet Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), place where Juan Ramón Jiménez got married with Zenobia in March 1916, is set in the activities programmed by the Department of Culture of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienniumum Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006 - 2008), organized with the aim of commemorating the fifty anniversary of the concession of the Nobel for literature and of the death of both.

America is liked less without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates people perfect. 
Paul Newman was one of them ". 
sentence the is of actress Sally Field the, that it worked with it in "Absence of malice", and gives the idea about of the distress of cinema American, and about across America, in the face of the impactante idea that Newman has left. 
Sight that cost them to give him an Oscar. 
And that it was withdrawn since 2007. 
And that it was known that it was very ill. 
Still like this has been a blow for all. 
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and I now have lost to one big friend", cried Robert Redford, "Wed life and my country were best thanks to his existence". 
Nobody had fear to do the ridicule even of exaggerating. 
A father of cinema and of the homeland in a had died particularly dark, with fear of the terrorists and of the markets, with the American selfesteem through the grounds, looking desperately for reasons for the dignity. 
When so hard is the time and without virtue the men and well few beings that to admire remain you, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
It personified an ideal almost Platonic of beauty and truth for all of them. 
He was reliable enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of causes lost and gained, from the foundation to fight the drugs created in honor of its first-born dead for overdose up to their brand of food home-made and organic. 
a whole gift to a country for which it has been difficult a lot to recover from a suicidal food culture. 
The shock wave of the admiration swept Hollywood without attending to nationalities nor passports. 
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that a man but an era has not died. 
Another English, the directive oscarizado Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was not even more not even less that the summit of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman its greatest inspiration. 
"It has left us the bar very high to all", confirmed George Clooney, maybe one of the few that nowadays it dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand of probity and of having a private life serious and far from the cameras. 
This is not always easy or even possible in the media jungle of today. 
But there is the one who tries it, and Paul Newman is its example. 
Divorced once but afterwards was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to the one that was faithful when they probably were in excess it the opportunities of not to be it. 
"But for what I am going to eat hamburger outside of home, if inside I have steak?", he himself used to joke. 
In the sky you seised it the pride that in the land their daughters coincide with their called anoraks, something common in America. 
"Of all the big papers that it interpreted, of none was it as proud as of that of devout husband, father lover, grandfather assiduous and dedicated philanthropist", say. 
career imperfect of an Madrid Olympic 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that a Olympics is celebrated in Madrid and, after the unsuccessful 2012, maybe that it is the 2016. 
But I wonder, are we prepared? 
If we follow the example of the race yesterday, 
I say than! They called the perfect career, and to my trial it has been the worst career with a lot in which I have been. 
A height of nonsense that, of course, if they took it into account as evaluation and me it examined, would be a very clear failure. 
But let's go for parties and from the outset. 
The nonsense starts with the collection of the ridge, which makes you have to go before. 
Which it does not seem to me badly, but if they already make you go that they give it everything (included the chip to prevent queues in the race). 
Then not. 
They here only did you to go to comprise the dorsal (first inanity, to go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, only there was cutting 'S' give birth the T-shirt (second inanity, because I need a size XL) 
In what world do we live? 
or is it that for the crisis they have decided to buy only T-shirts small with less spiders and cheaper? 
Then well, things as these are a trifle compared with those of the day of the race. 
Apart from which to have to go very soon to collect the chip, the queue when arriving is of 15 minutes and, besides, the knapsack has to be left. 
More than 35 minutes the waiting, a little incomprehensible for a career where more than 11 people are waited for, lasted. 
Then, as one might have waited, it started the race and we had not left yet the rucksack, although once obtained, the collection was worse. 
Besides the rain made enjoyable the waiting of more than 40 minutes, which it was joined with attempts of revolt popular and assault to the stall. 
I think that we around 500 people, will tomorrow probably have pneumonia, and some as me, will not even appear with time correct in the classification, due to the chip that gave me that, I imagine, the departure did not mark me correctly. 
Of course, if to me they asked me for the race perfect, this would not enter my thoughts. 
So I think that we will keep dreaming of a well prepared olympic city. 
Microsoft looks for receptionist (virtual) 
In the conference of the mit Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a sort of Artificial Intelligence without great intelligence but capable of carrying out some tasks basic, as asking for a cab (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move through the campus of the company) attending to what it listens to in the conversation. 
Thanks to a house and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can to know how many people there is in the room, who are - even to remember what they take post - and to listen and to understand the words key of their talks. 
Also grouping together the present ones according to the groups of conversation. 
In the video shows the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that it does not belong to the group that she is speaking with it and that is not an employee of company. 
He asks him whether it is there to visit somebody and he tells him that he will attend shortly to it. 
Everything without blue pantallazo. 
Impressive. 
But that, clear, is the future. 
Now the company has better things to concentrate on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has been spoken very above a change of strategy in Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be slighter and will not have so many associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with what was essential instead of full of commercial basurilla, they would go five times more quickly - man, Steve, will already be for less. 
a whole finding taking that Microsoft version after version, has added functions into account and "extras" to Windows. 
People are grateful the change of shift. 
Microsfot is right, the system operating keeps wasting importance, and also the software. 
When Google Chrome went out to the net, I was one of those that were added to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many indicated with rightly that a Navigator is not a system workable. 
system operating the will always be necessary because it is the essential layer so that the Hardware and the Software are understood. 
It complies the same role as his wife or her husband when you have to tell his mother-in-law something. 
It is true. 
It will never disappear but people have to think in the "death" of the system operating not as an truth absolute but relative. 
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people every time pay less attention to the system operating, and more to the browser Web. 
The computer is started only to execute the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and each item we pass more time sailing than in environment of Windows. 
What are half of the applications that come in the system used for? 
Less is more. 
and Windows 7 has to be less, a lot less, that Sight. 
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex. 
Microsoft it interests it more to integrate its online services and that at last they are an alternative to Google. 
They need it desperately, in fact, and I bring a small example. 
photo of this the post I took it in one of the stand-by rooms for employees of Microsoft, in Redmond, at the beginning of this month. 
In the machine of lemonade a poster asks them that they use its tool of search - "Your search. 
Ours future ". In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to search in the network. 
Last week, also a delay was by the way confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but to the end, rather throwing 2010.

Starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes would prevent the alcolock since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in expired air and it prevents; or when it is detected a concentration of alcohol is superior to the allowed one. 
Its cost is superior to the 1000 euros and would run for account of the sanctioned one.

The prize better endowed with the fashion 
Possibly there is not place in the most appropriate world to present a prize in fashion, that Paris and possibly there is not a designer living more delicacy and bont live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of the new talents of the fashion.

And for whether it was little, they are all brought together in a book that will bring the rest to the bookstores on the 30th of September.

The office is called tension and the pain computer of back.

Not, the number rises to, nothing else and nothing less, that 1001.

Besides, it offers other procedures as being in touch with the nature or recipes 100% natural that they contribute to the relaxation. 
If the adrenalin does not run any longer for your veins to restore the balance of the body and the stress has turned into a problem, hour of sitting in the picture, disconnecting the mind and concentrating on the reading is. 
Speaking asleep 
Some children talk at night. 
I do not refer to these that are aroused very lively telling us something that he has passed on the previous day, but to children who talk being asleep. 
The first time that maybe it happens you take a fright, but it is in fact not important. 
It is a benign alteration of the dream that is called somniloquios. 
It is quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents. 
Insurance that to more than one they have said that it spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can appear in so very sporadic (once in the life for example associated with an episode of fever high), or in a more periodic way (every day, once per a week, once in meseS...), the day after the child does not remember at all. 
There is not a unique cause that determines its emergence. 
Often they go to other changes the dream related as they are usually the nightmares, the nocturnal terrores, the nocturnal enuresis (asleep pis to be made) or the somnambulism, but being like this does not have necessarily. 
As we have already mentioned previously also linked to tables foot and very high can go, to situations of stress or overexcitation. 
Anyway it is a little studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which it appears also is very variable. 
It can be that it talks in a tone of voice calm, words parts, a murmur or everything the contrary (cries, weeping, long speeches... 
In the cases in which the demonstration is very intense it would be convenient to observe the child and to consult with a specialist, to prove whether there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and it gives him out this way. 
We have said that it is a alteration benign, therefore it does not have treatment, except that it goes associated with another alteration of the dream than yes it can be dealt (for example, if it goes associated to apnea of the sleep or to a frame of stress). 
What yes can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as: 
Trying not to excite the child a lot before going to sleep. 
Therefore to look for games reassured and programmes or series of television to prevent their being scary or a little violent. 
With children very nervous and that costs them a lot to relax, techniques of relaxation can be used to help them acquire a reasonably calm internally. 
This will favor that the child can have a dream more leisurely. 
Once the somniloquias appear try to maintain the calm. 
Remember that they are inoffensive for the child and that the day after it will not remember anything of what he has passed. 
Useful boards 
Do not arouse it. 
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break him the dream. 
Even if it is talking, he is sleeping and is therefore resting. 
Remember that if it appears very distressed during several episodes it would be convenient to consult or to find out what is what generates such anxiety in the child. 
If what he says (which is not the most usual thing) is understood, do not fall in the temptation to do a interrogation to him to worm information out of it. 
You will not obtain anything, because when being asleep is not conscious as to organize their thinking. 
Besides you will hear what says, but you do not know what is dreaming to say that, with what a lot of care in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions that you draw. 
You never tell the child that you can question him at night to know their secret. 
Not even of joke. 
That generates much anxiety. 
In summary, you do not worry, is not at all bad, it is an episode that it lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern at last!

In front, we did not let the midfield player pass and left only Riahi in position to attack. 
principle of the second time the was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well situated in a first attempt of Diebold to collect the refused balloon (53 '). 
but the goal scorer Illhousiens will not be able to savor much time their happiness and will be obliged to returning in the checkrooms a dozen of minutes later and to leave like this their fellow team in inferiority numerical.

In the face of this drama and to discontent of the public, the government of Canada made in February 1994 a public enquiry, presided over by the judge Horacio Krever, that intended to clarify the circumstances that had driven to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster does not reproduce more. 
Whereas it took the judge Krever to present their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that planning a new system of management of the blood in Canada had as intended. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau complied with this mission. 
Consequently of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood to supply all the other provinces and both territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec commenced their activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, remembers Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
After having done many efforts to improve the safety of products blood and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have recovered the confidence of the public ", says before stating proudly that at the beginning of 2008, near 94% of the Quebecois population it had confidence in Héma-Québec henceforth. 
The doctor Décary remembers however in that "him confidence is something extremely fragile". 
From its creation, on the 28th of September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the beginning of precautionary. 
In that period, we attended the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the illness of the crazy cow, a new variant of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, account Décary, in Europe. 
And we did not know whether this disease could be transmitted by the blood. 
Then we base ourselves on one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know it and when an illness taxes it can emanate of that, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that takes inevitably to the death, we establish measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, we then deny the blood of the people who had remained more than one month in the United Kingdom from the 1980. 
but some years ago, it has been proved out of everything doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood. 
This episode showed us so the beginning of precaution that was applied had of the sense. 
In 1999 a technique much more sensitive of detecting the HIV appeared in the market: the nucleído proofs of acid that they allow detecting directly in the blood of the donors the presence of the virus and not the one of antibodies against the virus, which the proofs used until now were founded on. 
The nucleído proofs of acid allowed shortening the period between the moment in which the person has been infected and the moment in which the first virus can be detected in the blood for our technical, explains the specialist. 
We could reduce this period in a duration less than a week. 
We decrease like this substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and that we can not detect them. 
These mejoramientos allowed bringing down considerably the risk to contract the AIDS for a transfusion blood. 
Nowadays one person every 12 million it runs the risk to receive blood contaminated by the HIV. 
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed that somebody is infected by the HIV. 
Like this since Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, will pass more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV occurs for a product blood. 
I think that nowadays it can be received or to prescribe a transfusion blood to recover the health without worries ", states the head of the address of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of products. 
It is never known cual pathogenic could emerge in the system. 
Last year the virus Chikungunya that, to example of virus the Nile West, is transmitted by an insect in the blood appeared in the island of. 
It has to be constantly watcher ", chases the doctor Décary before underlining that besides a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also foresee a sufficient supply. 
"The needs increase because the population ages. 
since treatments anti-American carcinogenic most aggressive, the patients often need an injection of blood Khmer or of wafers. 
ageing population% has also consequences on the net of the donors of blood that only 3% of admissible to donating blood regroups on average. 
all the people with good health, of a year and that correspond to the criteria of eligibility can donate however blood every 56 days, that is six times a year. 
On average, 14% of the people that their blood suggests is not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or from malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where the malaria reigns, they will be excluded during a period of a year. 
"With this 3%, we manage to hold an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very strange. 
But the members of this network of donors have to be renewed as they age and can not donate their blood more. 
but it is difficult to convince to the people to donate their blood, but especially to retain them and to incite them to be regular donor. 
Since the current life is very wild, we find rarely the time to pass an hour to donate his blood ", Francine Décary grieves. 
With a budget of 297 million $annual, Héma-Québec supplies not only products blood, but also woven human, among which bone grafts, heart mussel shells, balloons eye and skin that is almost exclusively used for the burned big ones. 
These fabrics are analyzed, are transformed and are frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, who manages also the only public bank of blood of the umbilical cord in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was considered as waste biomedical is full of a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for the treatment of illnesses serious as leukaemia. 
"We have celebrated few weeks ago, the setting in the bank of our thousandth shows blood cord umbilical and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year. 
We should start to suggest it for grafting at the beginning of year next "precise Doctor Décary that describes this program of socket of blood of cord as very popular. 
"Many mummies are disappointed of not being able to have of this" since Héma-Québec does not have resources to suggest this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.

Charest is in charge of the North 
prime minister does not exclude of starting off choices before the end of year 
As soon as it finishes the Council General of the Party Liberal, Jean Charest was yesterday where the new minister of the Health, Yves Bolduc (of left), tries to be done to choose during the by-election today in Juan-Talon, in Quebec. 
Refusing the limits of our last great border of the north ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with force visual staying in the great lines, after the general board of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind it, during its speech, images were projected. 
Paraded, in three screens huge, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, of mining, of Quebec seen for "Google Maps" maps, etc. 
media such as during the period election. 
prime minister thinks that the choices will take place this autumn, although it did to see that its timetable was very full. 
The "Plan north" is the fourth side of join "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, the of a "new area economic", that understands an agreement on the workforce with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently the opening of the - the Territory Northern to 49 ° parallel ° - it had never been the target of a presentation. 
prime minister the was limited however to explain why the North was "join jewel to potential immense", but did not give a term, amounts of investment, nor priority needs in future projects. 
What could be especially more developed they are: particularly the hidroelectricidad, the forest, but on all the mining sector, doped by growth in countries emerging and the reconstruction of the infrastructure public. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond" according to the enumeration of Sr. Charest. 
Is him "territory two twice big as France", "is home of ours, is in Quebec. 
Not only is to home of ours, but is in us ", insisted, as to show that myth national requested a myth. 
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the, underlined: the flood towards the gold in Abitibi, the Quebecois engineering, the James. 
"Belongs us, is ours future", added, after having done a pause theatrical to contemplate the map immense behind it. 
The North, 70% of the Quebecois territory, understands a part of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, needed prime minister during the press conference. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated. 
There is a line of border in which they do not go in agreement since a lot of time ago and, when the opportunity is presented, reiterate that position on behalf of the government ", indicated. 
Besides, "with the climatic changes, has to be rethought to our vision of the north", testified talking about the passage of the northwest, which will open every year due to the smelting ice. 
In this new geopolitical context the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites? 
prime minister the said that government of Quebec the would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly to young people. 
Two former ministers that originate from two different matches, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former representative of the Quebecois match of Ungava), already started consultations nearly one thirty of communities. 
An interdepartmental committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important paper started some work. 
prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily one summit", but a meeting in which "he will give a vision common". 
The development of the North would be done in compliance with the principles of development sustainable. 
The Plan north "will be agreed, tidy and respectful of the environment", was promising. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the first liberal ministers that preceded it. 
"As the liberals who preceded us, we have thought in another way to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and of development. 
This was one of the themes recurring of weekend, that started on Friday with a big cocktail to underline the 50 ° anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage in the power of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions suggests rebaptizing the Headquarters Beauharnois in Reservoir Adélard-Godbout. 
"Of Godbout, which created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that it did the gentle and the nationalisation the hydro-electricity, in Bourassa that it did the James ours divided knew to forge the future", declared Juan Charest. 
In the press conference, it invoked another reference, preserving that, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, first minister from the 1957 up to the 1963. 
Touching the subject of the project of hydroelectric reservoir of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Sr Charest underlined that its commissioning is foreseen by the 2012. 
"This stays among us, but foresee to be there", entrusted their militants, sparking off applause. 
Indeed the prime minister, that it said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not discard the possibility to start off a vote this autumn, which the law allows it. 
It underlines that its schedule is however full, particularly because of a mission of the board of the federation in China and a summit Quebec - New York. 
council general of weekend the supplied the leader Liberal a platform that contained resolutions nationalists, particularly "aspirations constitutional" than had problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec claims particularly the recognition of him "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
He wants also that Quebec names members of the Board of the broadcast and of the Canadian telecommunications and that these have a right to veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
Of the side of the opposition, we received the great lines of the with scepticism. 
The head of the Quebecois match, Pauline Marois, did to highlight the Policy of development of the North of Quebec that the government Landry had launched in 2001. 
As it the government liberal, arriving to power in 2003, renounced to apply it. 
If it had done it, "would do progressed nowadays" it commented Sra Marois next to its candidate in Jean-Talon (poll that was carried out today), Françoise Mercure. 
of Quebec the seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan on behalf of the government. 
"but what is wanted, is that this is not exactly one show", the leader commented on Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who turns over of holiday today. 
Letters - A dishonored country 
It is Sr. Vic Toews, former minister of him "Justice" (oh irony!) in the cabinet Harper, that saying was allowed last summer that Luisa Arbour was join "shame" to Canada. 
Dishonoring like this woman who took a fight relentless for the justice and that deserves all our admiration what says everything on the relations of between the prime minister and of Stephen Harper. 
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the implied occidental countries, that it has not repatriated to his national that it is locked up in the camp concentration at Guantanamo. 
It is a government that does not take into account any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager very young when the facts that it is reproached for happened. 
The only government that, in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Agreement of Geneva, denies its promise and lets live in inhuman conditions a child - soldier. 
The only one that chonta with a false justice to evaluate the culpability of the accused. 
let's remember that the UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Association of the Canadian lawyers, particularly sustain the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he has the benefit of a process fair in Canada. 
It is this government that closes the eyes on the torture: it is little important it that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after many years levies. 
Yet we do not realize that, but assist now a insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of nuestra "democracy", that is the word that Harper continuous to repeat and that it does not have felt. 
The hour in which no moral exists more has already arrived: we can ill-treat, to torture, to imprison a citizen Canadian arbitrarily as it wants the head of government until now minority (what will he pass after the 14th of October)?). 
Many electors think that they will find the salvation in a match that praises the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounced what the reputation made and dignity of our country. 
Sr. Toews the shame is provoked by this waiver and by anything else. 
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of the 17 of September, Le Devoir published a card of Sr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and director of the Canadian miner Barrick Gold. 
Following an logic Orwellian, Barrick Gold states that the biggest auriferous company in the world tried a process for defamation of euros against three authors and a small house publishing in order to provoke a "debate public transparent". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law. 
Without surprise this difference fundamental is completely concealed by Sr. Garver. 
Cause, according to Barrick Gold, the best mode of taking a public debate would be to damage anyone dares to sustain a position contrary to his? 
outcome of the lawsuit the is important few, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to use up sums considerable in order to prepare its defense and of fighting, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the pockets almost bottomless of the mining. 
The tactics, in these fights unequal, is often consists in ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will gag opposition the besides frightening anyone will dare to examine the question again. 
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that has should present its vision of the facts. 
On the contrary to what is done in several of countries where Barrick Gold works the debates in Canada are done normally by the change of ideas and not to blows of stick. 
It was enough then the mining opening its books, their files and established a real debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent equipment of search that would have been able to clarify the issue. 
but Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and refuses the petitions and the cards of support for the authors of Noir Canada. 
Possibly could Sr Garver explain how he can ask for a "public" debate despising the opinions of this? 
According to the vice-president, it seems that this word designates only the very paid lawyers and not for everything the Canadians; that represents a view very limited of the concept. 
In democracy the opponents have also the law of talking. 
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or what he does not want to understand -, is that the public who holds the authors and the publishers of noir Canada makes it especially because it refuses the way brutal of the mining. 
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge it, but having as basis changes civilized of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution - gag (chasing the "debate public", Barrick Gold has just deposited a request with regard to the authors of Noir Canada becoming friendly them to their not using this word) more). 
Besides the surreal speech of Sr. Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of search university and of the truth, essential even all societies democratic. 
He denies the law of mentioning sources credible and doing a debate on the facts and the interpretations, which represent the basis of work intellectual. 
Whether it is impossible to study and to discuss on subject that the rich companies of this world in a country as Canada under death many persecution, dislike who will be able to make it? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a debate public and transparent, he could make it following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
It has a right of reply. 
The university world, which we belong to, knows how to administer the debates and the disagreements and to solve the conflicts since a lot of time ago. 
The excessive persecution of Barrick Gold shows clearly that, on the contrary to what he aims for, he does not feel like doing a debate transparent. 
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the debate public in Canada, and it is already time that the governments place devices that limit gender persecution abusive. 
Rescue Operation of Wall Street - Democrats and republicans agree 
The administration Bush and the leaders of the Congress, at the same time republican and democrats, finally arrived to an agreement yesterday on the plan of economic rescue more important from the Great Depression of the thirties. 
The new version of the plan of 700 a billion American dollars that intends to stop the financial crisis that shakes Wall Street since months ago has to be still confirmed by both of. 
He foresees particularly: a better control on the part of the ones chosen of its setting in application, of new mechanisms that intend to assure the reimbursement of the inverted public money, of the new arrangements to contain the number of seized homes the lack of payment, as well as a law of taxation on the salaries paid to the leaders of companies often-quoted. 
secretary American Treasury the, Henry Paulson, the president of the of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the republican representative in the table of negotiating, the senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news some minutes after midnight, yesterday, after one marathon of negotiations Che lasted two days. 
"We carry out great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets", the representative of the administration declared Bush Henry Paulson. 
"Totality has been done to put under cover the economy and the ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis in Wall Street", explained the democrat. 
"It is the basic point: if we do not do this, the traumatism, the chaos and the perturbation on the daily life of the Americans will be immense", the republican Judd Gregg testified. 
The negotiations had been finished very quickly in recent hours because they feared the effect that would provoke a new failure in the mood of investors. 
The ultimate hour that had been fixed was opening of markets this morning. 
The two candidates in the American presidential choices, which have been stuck late to the negotiations, were rather shown favorable for the agreement, without forgetting however to squeeze its unhappiness of being obliged to arrive to this barbarity. 
By Senator Democrat Barack Obama the certain arrangements to reach agreement the was conferred to him, particularly the one that would allow to the owners to preserve their home and the on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies for the State. 
"When it is asked them to the contributors to take action extraordinary because of the irresponsibility of some, does not have to be happy. 
but these measures are necessary ", commented in the American television. 
Its republican opponent, John McCain questioning in another chain to know whether it would vote for the suggested plan, answered that: "I would like to see the details, but I expect to vote it. 
The important points that I read [they show] that is something that we will have to digest and with the one that we will be able to advance. 
It said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable ". 
The plan of 700 a billion intends to buy with the money of the contributors debts dubious, assets to risks and unmarketable of the American financial institutions. 
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis provoked by the bursting of a property bubble that first took to the collapse of the mortgage credits of risk before being extended to other forms more common of credit titles (PCAA) and of provoking a freeze of liquidity and a rush of the banks and of the financial institutions. 
He is a group of chosen republicans that it had made change the first draft agreement, last week. 
We think that we have gone out of the stagnation since the democrats accepted that true active "toxicants" of companies in difficulty are only assured by the government, rather that bought. 
With the aim of ironing out the differences for all everyone in Congress the, we also add an arrangement that stipulated that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this programme, he could impose new rates that they would intend to help it recover money. 
new plan the foresees the payment of a first part of 250 thousand billion to which will be able to be added 100 another billion if it seems necessary to the president it. 
The payment of another 350 a billion would have that to be confirmed by another vote on behalf of the. 
However of its help, Washington will obtain participation in the useful companies that for him will cost dividends in the event of gains and that it will be to sell when the storm will be passed again. 
The federal government will have the possibility to defer the procedures of embargoes that concerned the houses obtained with property loans according to this plan, as well as to fix limits on the remuneration and on the compensations in cash paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis. 
architects of the plan Representatives would want to see it submitted to the poll of the of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday. 
In spite of all their efforts, yet it is not sure that his plan will be approved. 
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, on behalf of the republicans as well as of the democrats. 
The republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission of the finances of the house, declared to its electors that "with every evidence, Washington does not want understand". 
"We have a problem financial very serious. 
There are some solutions. 
but not the that it consists in benefiting of the contributors ". 
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is promoter of a small group in the Congress, presents the problems in another way, but he arrives to the same conclusion. 
"Four Hundred professors of economics, among whom three Prizes Nobel, wrote us to say us: we ask To the Congress not to be sped up and to examine attentively the way that has that take", testified yesterday. 
In this same time, in Europe, we had another time the proof of the nature global of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting the three countries Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the bank group Fortis for 11,2 thousand millions of euros (16,3 a billion dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and of Luxembourg it had been necessary after the bank French BNP Paribas gave to know that it renounced to buy its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 a billion euros (2,9 a billion dollars) during the crisis of the property loans of risk in the States United. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 banks European largest and of the ten insurers largest. 
"This is not lost money, the Dutch minister of the Finances, Wouter Bos, testified yesterday. 
However, we recover a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is precisely something that the savers and the families appreciated now that the times are uncertain. 
During this time, to the other side of the, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis. 
According to the press English the government would see about all the pending loans in the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 a billion euros (75,5 a billion dollars) of property loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander introduced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branch offices and accounts bank of the bank British. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be second bank the, after Northern Rock, who the British government should naturalize from the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) - of an icon committed 
Its blue eyes represented its triumph for so long. 
Had actor American with a smile charming released himself from its narcissistic side? 
Yes and not. 
Its modesty, its sensitivity and a talent that was evident also will have distanced it from the record of power that the real monsters sacred have. 
but what major corridor of fund! 
Paul Newman, dead on Friday, at 83 years, because of a cancer of lung in their ranch of Connecticut, one of the last icons of cinema American of the years fanfare remains. 
It is less magnificent than Brando, to whom it looked very alike and which was considered by a lot of time as a competitor in the cinema more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and of the bursting of the conventions dramatic. 
The mixed blood often does children magnificent. 
It appeared in Ohio in 1925, of father Jewish German and of mother of origin Hungarian. 
One of the faces glorious dream American will originate from these roots European. 
Without egos excessive, last mark of quality. 
Because in it a whole country fallen in love of self-service made was projected man, of the combatant of the war of the Pacific, wounded in combat, which at the beginning of the fifties studied the dramatic art in Yale, afterwards frequented the actor 's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, in the television and soon in the cinema. 
This man who militated for civil rights was also the self-propelled pilot that was classified in second position in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, folded by a sex symbol, although member of a couple models formed from the 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
The secret sides of this secret, discrete and embarrassing star, allergic to the scandals of the show business that we do not know very well, disappear also with it. 
He is a man decent, in the sense widest of the floor. 
death of Paul Newman the provoked chaos to the cinema goers this weekend of, whereas their major roles are collided in screen black the memories. 
More than one half a century of seventh art American in perpetual moves parades through it. 
Many memories turn over Sundance Kid (1969), the young man that its sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata rejects on the roof of adapted of Tennessee Williams in 1958, to memory as the cow-boy with charm of Butch Cassidy and the. 
Nearer to us (1990), we evoke its sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not comply with all its promises. 
Others as Paul Newman have passed to the history of cinema. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, violent, tormented criminal, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by the hatred), of Robert Wise, a paper destined to repeated James Dean after its death, that really it launched Newman in 1956. 
This dishonest nice in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Blow), Oscar to the best film in 1973. 
Bitter and vengeful player of billiards in the magnificent film The Hustler de Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat Money de Martin Scorsese, which for him cost in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations, to the character in The Colour of. 
This face that it changes with time, was it. 
Still it. 
The periods change during his career. 
young people know it especially thanks to Slap Shot de George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team hockey ice little Orthodox. 
called anoraks saw it again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers COAS. 
With a last paper of godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition de Sam Mendes in 2003 the picture was curled. 
On the contrary to several legends of cinema that quite soon gave up the race, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its oros, their fanfare and their concessions. 
The French movie director Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humour, "as a challenge that lives in" the underplaying "and that it judges its too much supported services. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to which the roles arrived for a long time without making anything. 
However he less often interpreted the paper of young attractive young man than of marginal one: neurotic, alcoholic, cabrones or desperate, whose outlines reflected the revolts. 
As director, Newman revealed sides its real modest sensitivity not very known. 
Its film Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with its wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, described a portrayal female of melancholy. 
It that lost to its son Scott because of overdoses dedicated it his film Harry Sound and in 1984, work of shame and of sadness. 
"Among the numerous tributes that broke out yesterday for Newman, its big friend and former colleague of weapons Robert Redford (they had worked Sundance Kid joint in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the) stated, very saddened:" my life and my country were better thanks to his existence " 
Generosity love of the existence are features important of the actor deceased. 
Of the other side of his career legend of, also a big militant for the civil rights, the ecology the film independent, is hidden one rebellious against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We will have seen his face a lot to reign on the boats of vinaigrette sauce, of the sauces, of the cookies and of other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag. 
advantages of these sales were given to its Foundation for childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather that to please of their myth, until the end will have been jeopardized. 
He lent their five daughters a card that contained these phrases: "always and up to the end, your father was incredibly thankful for their good star. 
It was a privilege of being there. 
And a privilege for us of having followed the race of an artist American lucid so generous. 
In short a citizen model.

the political and its accomplices of the falsification of documents committing frauds of significant damage, in way of business, continuously and in form organized besides other offenses, among these are accused. 
According to the Office they used for own ends the backgrounds obtained in the public competitions justifying the fulfillment of the tasks with bills false on many occasions. 
The public funds and that of the town councils - in its whole about 65 million HUF - they stopped partially in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partially in the pockets of individuals. 
The method, which was introduced by the investigators also, was to justify the payment of the backgrounds obtained in the public competitions with false bills behind which there was not implementation actual, the different associations never complied with its assumed duties. 
According to the accusation, most of the bills were false. 
For that they obtained the check books in the market of the District of Józsefváros and stamps circulars were fabricated in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the question that on behalf of what company the forged bill had to be carried out was decided among others in that tour in the Superior Region of the Balatón where János Zuschlag sent István sides. 
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants. 
He asked for bill for their consumption and these acted as model to produce the bills that they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Young and Sport Matters, in the Ministry of Social and Work Matters, thus as in the Town Council of the Capital. 
These bills were signed in the main by István sides and its accomplice András ri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public subsidies. 
During one of its "journeys of study" sides it chose a brewery could. 
According to two bills dispatched in 2003 by Zuschlag and their accomplices this centre food style provided the food for a group of ninety people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However - according to the manager of the centre - many people do not fit at the same time in this place. 
In equal way, the bill dispatched in the summer 2002 of to the Foundation Jobb Jövért - later call Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - it was full of mistakes formal and contextual. 
For a hostel of the locality of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not be lodged there in a night, however in the bill they figured a hundred and 30 people. 
But the manufacturers of bill of great fantasy also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. then in the bookkeeping of the same one - according to the information given to the Office - not had documents to name of Jobb Jövért and of Hoppá. 
Gyz Farkas the manager of that company, informed it to hvg.hu that when it was mentioned by the office and showed it the bills, it already knew that they were false documents. 
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in instead incorrect." 
He added: besides the problems formal neither it agreed that according to the bill a hundred people were lodged, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many people do not fit. 
Besides, in the bill they were included also eaten, whereas the restaurant some time ago that it does not work. 
enthusiasts manufacturers of bills did not inform themselves about the travel agency chosen in Budapest organizing exclusively trips abroad, so in bills of the agency they indicated foolishly a journey within Hungary as service, which did not coincide with the practice of dispatch of bills of the agency either, either. 
Besides - as it was known during the research - they also included in the document the IVA, even though the journeys out of the territory of the were exempt from taxes. 
Among other things the measure VAT was also incorrect in the four documents dispatched through the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jövért, since services that company are not full with one 25 but only with 15 per cent of VAT, besides the employees of the only extended bills done by machine however the bill was manual. 
Besides los "senders" committed other errors also, as in the case of a company in which they put the transport by road to which - it was known during investigations of the office - she does not carry out the company founded as consultant of investments in the bill as activity carried out. 
Equally for differences formal - inadequate format of the bill, forged cachet - was known that the bills dispatched for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány are false, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont. 
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied having dispatched these bills. 
The forgers neither paid attention to which when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate the HIB Kft there (2001). of Nyíregyháza it was in the process of liquidation, that's why the person in charge of the process of clearance - according to our information - denied having dispatched such a document. 
They dispatched consciously the bills 
Another group of manufacturers of bills false are those that were conscious that they had to dispatch bills fictitious constituted by those. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, dispatched bill to the value of about four a million HUF to name of the Foundation Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért. 
To the manager of the Collab Kft. according to the accusation - one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to dispatch bills fictitious, convinced it. 
In equal way the Biogate Kft collaborated with Zuschlag and their accomplices., at present low process of clearance, which in 2003 supplied bills for an approximate value of five million HUF to the foundation Jobb Jövért Alapítvány, to the association Atlasz Egyesület and to the association Vörösfeny Egyesület, without activity economic real behind. 
There was not movement of capital either, for afterwards they nullified bills ready but it was forgotten to make this entity figure in their documents. 
In the following group of manufacturers of bills false those that have some link with the accused are included. 
So for example Iván Kubatov was the demandadero of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with headquarters fictitious in Budapest, which was occupied with the trade of fuels and of vehicles. 
This company dispatched numerous bills for an approximate value of 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of resources computer. 
According to data from research these bills were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since the 14th of September 2005 is of settlement under process. 
manager of this company was a Romanian to who Iván Kubatov should have attended also documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005. 
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he himself dispatched bills for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány to behalf of the company charging the amount. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. they were founded by Romanian bricklayers to express application for Iván Kubatov. 
However, none of the companies worked indeed owed - according to the accused - to their not receiving work. 
but benefited from these companies, since at the request of its accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the documents of record of the company, dispatched bills to behalf of societies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y - Generáció. 
Kubatov on behalf of the cash investment, of the Delta Trió, of the Fa-Bani Jos, of the Jos Investment and of the Linaxtrade gave 15 bills to various entities in total for a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The Office considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10% of the amount of the bills. 
That man made use even of the society in limited copartnership Szi-Beri to dispatch fictitious bills used in the competition of Biztos Pont. 
The Y - Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in the month of January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), entity of public utility of the Socialist Party. 
Of tender of the they obtained 500 a thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the goals of the competition. 
So that this is not discovered, they presented the eba five fictitious bills received of the Works Team Kft. 
These were the bills found during the record of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had in the headquarters of the of. 
Part of the defendants will probably relate the course of counterfeiting of invoices in the judgment - as they did in the Office -. 
The most interesting thing will be able to be the confession of the main accused himself János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything. 
For their confessions until now have not been very detailed and although repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not made it until the present. 
question the is: What interest does making it have?, then perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists arrived to an agreement with it so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities. 
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even take offence, since to relieve their conditions prison it requested house arrest, but it was denied to him repeatedly. 
whereas the many perpetrators of crimes economic value very superior, that never returned the money, walk freely or at least they can wait in their own home for the judgment, he does not have possibility for that. 
Psychology of the overlaying ones: Why do we spend more money? 
participants of auctions are prone to spend more money and to overestimate the product. 
The neurologists and economists of the of New York discovered the basis neurological - economic of this conduct known and in an apparent way irrational. 
According to the study appeared in the magazine Science, the people do not want to lose in competences as the auctions of eBay, that's why it prefers paying even an excessive price. 
The scientists tried to establish the scheme neurological of east "stake" in the middle of auction experimental. 
One of the groups of voluntary played lottery, the other one took part in an auction and meanwhile the active areas of the brain of the involved people in the experiment was examined through the system of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
In both games the participants could gain money, but during the auctions, where it is basic element to bet more than the other one, when losing the game the functioning of the complex called stratum placed under the crust brain intensified. 
area of the brain, besides many other functions, has a role in the mechanism of "writ prize" of the nervous system. 
Thus according to the scientists the increase of betting is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of stratum. 
To found its theory economists of group scientific carried out also a study follow-up financial. 
In this experiment three groups bet against a person different circumstances. 
the value real of the product was simply communicated to group of control in question, and its members bet. 
Another group besides that was promised that if they win, they would receive 15 dollars more of prize to. 
However the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but if it lost the auction members of the group lost even this money. 
like this the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other one the failure. 
However, checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, members of the group that staked "disadvantage the failure" were ready to bet even more than the members of the group control and of the group "winner". 
"These results can not be deduced from any existing economic theory previously. 
Then those until now only explained the phenomena of auctions with the joy of winning and with the prevention of the risks. 
the methods Neurologically impaired helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so that now we arrive to a third explanation "- it established Andrew Schotter, professor of the faculty of economics of the of New York. 
Hepatitis: When must it go to the doctor? 
In the world a few hundred million people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary chronic liver is considered one of the causes main of death. 
The number of being contaminated in this country is calculated in a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment for many of the ill ones do not know that they are contaminated. 
designation of hepatitis is the common noun of different illnesses of the liver caused by viruses. 
The symptoms look very alike; infection of the liver and the jaundice are characteristic, but its pathogenic agents and the caused illnesses are very different. 
The viruses of the hepatitis in dependence on agent they are propagated through two ways main: the hepatitis to and by way food (for example with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with the blood and with body humors (sperm, humor of the vagina froth). 
It is recommendable to the travellers to be protected through vaccine against the virus A and B, against the C there are not bovine. 
The symptoms of the hepatitis to appear two or the infected food three weeks after consuming, appears by a bad state general, weakness, pain abdominal and nausea. 
After that they appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement puts on clear, the urine of colour dark and the cure can last even two - three weeks. 
Annually a million people die in the world in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by the hepatitis B the forms most serious of this disease. 
The main reason of that is that according to the calculations, only one of every ten contaminated receives pharmacological treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have consequences very serious: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer. 
Most of the contaminated ones does not know that it is ill because this agent unhealthy destroys cells of the liver in a gradual form and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years afterwards. 
Therefore the premature recognition, the systematic medical control, is very important. 
This illness is much more frequent in three groups: the people who had blood transfusion before 1991, the consumers of drug and those that take tattoos. 
At present it there is around 200 million people in the world that suffer of hepatitis C chronic. 
As to this disease it can be discovered with a routine control of laboratory also, it is worthwhile to consult some symptom unknown with the doctor of the family when experimenting. 
The illness has curable if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the body, like this can be suppressed the infection and to prevent the cancer. 
On the 30th of September it is the World Day of the Hepatitis, which was organized by first time in 2004 for representative organizations of the ill ones. 
aim its is to catch the attention of the causes of the chronic infections of the liver caused by the viruses and of the importance of recognition premature. 
Does it hurt it less to whom they believe in God? 
According to the outcome of a recent research, the religious faith has very tempting to resort effect that relieved also the death of the martyrs of Catholicism. 
The scientists of the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment: they analyzed of that the religious belief in that what way influences in the human pain - it informed the newspaper British Telegraph. 
Within the framework of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 believers Catholic and to the same amount atheists of, meanwhile all were looking a paint of the Mary. 
According to the results, the catholic believers went capable of excluding most of their pain. 
Thanks to the technique of scanning of the brain human, it could be verified that the catholic believers were capable of activating that part of its brain that is responsible for regulating the pain. 
This experiment is the first of the series of research that next to the academics also scientists, philosophers and theologians of the various departments of the take in part. 
The analysis happened in the following way; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, who applied the electric shock. 
Researchers the asked him the participants of the experiment who fixed their sights in two paints; to the Virgin María, work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and to the Lady of the ermine of Leonardo gives Vinci of the 15th century. 
researchers the had the expectation that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful ones, since they chose the oil because of Leonardo because it was not too different to the other one, and thought that it had effect reassuring. 
The patients passed half an hour in a scanner MRI, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four parts successive while they observed paint of issue religious or else the other one. 
The Catholics stated that when looking to the Mary they were felt in "safety" as people "protected", "he calmed down and in his heart it reigned the peace". 
They felt 12 per cent less of pain when observing the frame of issue religious than when they looked at the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias that also took part in the experiment, thinks that with any image that is so impactante a effect similar with atheists can be obtained also, the image right only has to be found. 
"We should find the portrait of a person for which they go very positively, as for a mother or one father" - it said the psychologist. 
Bishop vicar Tom Wright the celebrated result of the investigation. 
"exercise of faith would owe and in many cases of true changes ours personality" - it added Wright. 
After these formidable results a single question remains: What effect would it have for the regulation of the pain if the Madonna de Leonardo were shown to the faithful ones it or of another painter of its size? 
Perhaps would the vision of a Virgin Mary of high quality still show better results? 
You are what you say of yourself 
In its tenth birthday the Google can state: he can meet him in the pockets of the people, as well as in the sky above your head; he knows where they passed its holidays, to what doctors visiting and what being what interests them. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is not sufficient yet. 
On the other hand the sceptical that they do a parallel with the orweliana vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt declared to the newspaper Financial Times not long ago that the objective main of Google is to bring the greatest number possible of data personal together on their users, and this is necessary to be able to comply with the original goals of the founders of Google: let's bring all the information the world together in a system! 
According to the leader of Google the company even after ten working years that she turned over to the World is still in the initial phase of the determination of being able to treat all the information. 
To the question that what is going to pass in five years Schmidt answered like this: he would want for the Google to be able to answer to the questions as "What to do tomorrow?" Which would be the work that better would be convenient me? "however, the software will not be able to answer to questions in an apparent way so simple as long as there are not enough information users. 
all users Internet are conscious that during its shipping in the key words looked for, the addresses IP and the pages where they passed when finishing the search are stored with precision. 
graces for example to Personalized Search that it started out two years ago, the users can store their own record of shipping, can consult again for what looked before, which opened and thanks to this record it will generate searches much more personalized - in this same logic the Recommendations will base itself, on the one that the system will offer us products and services in base of the previously defined and stored preferences. 
What will happen if they make use my data against my same, if they comprise information on my activities? those users who see to Google seeing the monopoly informative ask. 
In most of the cases the potential represented by the company is rather what can be frightful and not the remorse, the fear for the punishment, the desire for freedom or rebellion against the power. 
However it is an already confirmed fact that not only preserve, but in justifiable cases they also yield to third all the expressions looked for, in these cases there is not anything that protects the rights personal of surfers. 
The example most discussed of recent times was maybe the coordinated action against the pedophile Brazilians, when Google delivered the information of its page of Web, called Orkut, to identify the pedophile ones, to the Brazilian government. 
However, the internautas who worry about the rights of persons, in May were relieved when the company together with the EFF, organization for the defence of the rights electronic, proved successfully before the court that was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, it will not be able to be obliged to him to Google, through any of the points of the constitution to supply any type of required information in secret for the FBI. 
(At the same time the federal government managed to obtain under the pretense of reinforcing the law of protection of the approved childhood years behind, close to fifty thousand addresses and about a thousand sentences looked for, but without obtaining the lists of search of the individual users, nor either the complete lists of Web websites and of words watchwords of the last two months).) 
like this the opinion is quite contradictory on the Google: they criticize it those that they fear to supply their data personal because they think that their privacy their lives private is damaged when starting to use the services of Google, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of preserving image. 
While so much, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic supporters, Webloggers and users of other countries, see the future generation in them, him "corporation of vanguard", not like this to its competitor the Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as conqueror of the, for a lot that both fight for the same goal. 
This can happen because the Google contrary to of Microsoft, does not ask of the users any identifying code or money for their applications the code is opened and the package of programme free, constantly update and seems younger, more collaborative that the practice of giant official of the software. 
but can be also because the geek see the existing very problematic relation between the rights of people with accurately and the Internet that more mentioned keys were caused precisely for one of the words in recent years: 
the Web 2.0. The Web 2.0 is been about the collaboration, of leaving deliberate marks behind us and making use of the channels of communication available, and while the measured of these different individually, the essence keeps being it: showing us to ourselves. 
young normal a can have profile on numerous pages collective, from Facebook up to Xanga, and even it can join them with other services, as for example the Twitter or the last.fm that offers lists of their habits of music, afterwards to these can include them in a system of follow-up as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can have besides a blog, in which most recent galleries photos appear automatically, that is stored in the Flickr or in the Picasa. 
We can know numerous cases of those that it is inferred that for example the girlfriend, when seeing the flow of photographs of the following morning of the common friends, finds out with who passing the previous night its fraudulent boyfriend or being able to dismiss the employee of a company because this writes his opinion honest in its blog on the direction of the company: One thing is safe, the definition of the life private was revalued completely. 
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows of itself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of youth of our days. 
And the one that wants to conceal something, or at least intends to avoid the monopoly of Google, can make it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses the system of search of Google, but does not leave fingerprints). 
There are many people that do not want to be registered on the collective pages to avoid they being able to find them, but can be replaced the applications "on line" of Google, from the software of writing of texts up to the applications of image and reading of news with alternative versions that are not connected with enormous servers even they prepare the profile more perfect possible on us. 
The public opinion waits almost that openly the day in which the Google shows its true face. 
The company with its value current of 156 a billion dollars costs more than IBM the (140 a billion dollars), the Intel (124 a billion dollars) or the Coca-Cola (110 a billion dollars), the surfaces of publicity of AdWords / AdSense threaten land income of agencies advertising, as the services that are introduced every time more quickly other developers companies of software cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also many. 
The critical observers however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example management senior refused clearly the protest of employees after doubling the price of nursery schools of the company, considered too expensive the unlimited number of feeding of employees the, but all this is not anything in comparison with the fact that in 2006 the Google yielded in front of the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according the agreement filtered every information that violated the good moral and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the regulations internal of the company says that they will not announce any service new with advance, but only when it was already ready to work, what if it is safe is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to turn over to the: whereas some think that the project of scanning and file of books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be mentioned by the High Court of the United States, others fear Health of its system, because in it we can create our own profile health full with analysis previous, with our doctors and our problems. 
and the fact that Google is going to create a database genetic, will be able to provide a good raw material for the writers of works of science fiction, the Scroogled, novel of the popular one of Cory Doctorow, describes in orweliana form that future, in which a man only of data from Google can be described alarmingly well. 
Under age two helped erase the marks to the author of the double murder of the city of Ózd. 
police the questioned to under age on the double murder of Ózd two who, according to founded suspicion, they helped erase the marks of the crime - the spokesman of the General Police Station of Public Order to the province of Borsod said the Tuesday. 
The youngsters recognized the offense that was imputed to them, and at present they are accused of fautores of crime. 
The two smallest - according to information of the agency news they are two girls - will be able to be defended in freedom. 
For the complicity they can receive even with 5 years in prison. 
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a man of 23 years - is in detention since Sunday. 
The crime of murdering several people with premeditation and for greed is accused for him. 
During the research it was revealed that the young 23 years owed a large sum to a man of 53 years. 
accused the did not want to pay its debt, that's why on Wednesday of last week quoted its creditor to the headquarters of a company of Ózd, where it killed it and afterwards it killed also the daughter of 9 years of the victim. 
According to information from the Tim the young prepared a lot before to perpetrate the crime, for he committed the murder with a gun hidden previously in the place of crime. 
The police analyze with a qualified person to the weapon and circumstances of their use. 
of Warsaw the presented an offer to buy of Prague 
The Stock Exchange of Warsaw offered euros - some five billion crowns Czech - by a hundred per cent of the actions of the Stock Exchange of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Stock Exchange of Warsaw confirmed the offer that the Poles did, even though the Czechs have previously excluded to the Bag of Warsaw of the possible new owners of the Prague. 
reason the is that of Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
99 per cent of the action is in the hands of the Polish State that in a few months wants to sell 60 per cent of them. 
The Czech economic journal E15 informed that the supply of Poles has been the highest among those that offered for the ones shown interest in the of Prague. 
According to the press, until now they gave offer the Bag of Vienna, the Transatlantic Bag Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the Bag of London and the Deutsche. 
Petr Koblic, the head of the Stock Exchange of Prague declared last week that among the interested ones the worst owner again would be the Stock Exchange of Warsaw and did not discard the possibility of with that, in a future the Stock Exchange of Prague disappearing. 
The experts calculate the value of the Bag of Prague in about 5 to 10 a billion crowns. 
According to the agreement of the shareholders 90 per cent of the actions could be sold approximately. 
The major owner of the Stock Exchange of Prague is the investment bank Homeland Finance with a participation of a 25 per cent approximately, follows it the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14,7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 
with 13,5 per cent. On the financial crisis from the point of view of the press European 
The main European journals in its comments of on Tuesday dedicated to the every time increasingly deep crisis financial international talk of a "segundo 11 of September". 
The global financial catastrophe is owed to the North American president - it gives an opinion The the of Rome - the president has not been capable even of obtaining the support of his own party for the bill done hastily, whose aim is to give it solution to this plight... 
Instead of one new "Pearl Habor", of the one that talked the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more correct to talk of a "segundo 11 of September". 
According to a part of the Madrilenian press, Washington is the scapegoat. 
In the view of the world the error of the leadership political the States United was the one that it took to the economy global at the edge of the abyss. 
The danger of the crumbling of the North American monetary system and this grows every time more afterwards, will have effects on the world. 
Although the plan of Bush was not perfect, after the vote in Congress the danger that Washington does not offer political instrument to treat the crisis rises up. 
economy world the is suspended in the air - precisely when one of the biggest transformations of history of capitalism is carried out. 
Neglectful case to this threat - it notes the Tages-Anzeiger de Ginebra. can not be done 
Some states today still can throw it belt of lifeboat to the staggering financial institutions, being able to save them like this from the bankruptcy with the money of the contributors. 
but if as I dominate them they are worn away more bank still, then any longer either the new funds, and nor the new improvisations will not be sufficient. 
It is needed in the long term that the member states of the European Union leave their selfishness nationalistic at a hand and centralize the control on the fragmented financial markets. 
The financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday more than 100 a billion euros - remembers the Viennese one Der Standard, adding that the worries that, as they did the North American ones, also the European contributors will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are every time more real. 
EU the until now has not been occupied seriously with the crisis that it passes as a cúname for the Continent Old Man. 
Los "saviors" not will have that to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but would be good if they defined: in What cases using taxpayers money ’ to avoid is justified one badly bigger? 
The intelligent writ imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
Which would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the sensors of existing obstacles in the nature? 
For example that of the bumblebees. 
In a surprising project presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the bumblebees gave the point starting for the engineers of Nissan to design the next generation of the system of preventing the collisions. 
Nissan the, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the imitative system of robotic address of type cars BR23C of the nature, to which they gave the characteristics of the bumblebees, with the final goal to create a system that can avoid the all collisions. 
During the flight every bumblebee creates its own oval particular space that in fact resembles a lot our protective capsule of safety - it explained Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and of development and research, in the exhibition. 
The compound eyes of the bumblebees which they are capable of seeing in all the addresses in a angle higher to 300 degrees have an important paper. 
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the system of measurement of the length for laser beams. 
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C in a distance from 2 meters, in a angle 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms into a maneuver to prevent the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, afterwards the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction turning the wheels in the measure necessary. 
Unlike any system existing this manoeuvre is totally instinctive. 
"If it were not like this the robot of the vehicle could not react with enough quickly as to avoid the obstacles" - it explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Laboratory of Mobility and of the project of the robot of vehicles. 
It must react immediately and in an instinctive form, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable interior layer of the protective capsule of safety, in a layer in which at present every type of collisions are considered unavoidable. 
The process must reflect what a bumblebee makes to avoid other bumblebees. 
This process must be carried out in one to open and to close the eyes. 
However, unlike the bumblebees, the movement can not go up, down or diagonal, but it can only be bidimensionally and exclusively in the address of gyration of the wheels 
This way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, the movement rotating and the acceleration in addition here only used the frenaje as possibility for the robot of the car. 
The BR23C uses batteries of lítio - polymer that is lighter and its density of energy is bigger, which means that they have a life time longer than that of lítio - ion. 
According to Andoh, what is important is the reaction instinctive and intelligent and not the capacity of processing of data, nor a lot less that of storage. 
machine on every second must only process some signs of entry and react according to the case. 
It is not necessary to store these data or to react with an instinctive logic based on data from the manoeuvres previous, like this uses only some tens of kilobytes by heart. 
Memories of gigabytes, nor of megabyte optical fibre cables are not needed. 
This is the first step to develop the technology to avoid immediately the obstacles, that according to calculations of the Nissan, in ten years the manufactured models will be able to be incorporated successively. 
possibility for its implementation is to incorporate the Unit to the system of navigation for satellite way GPS to take the driver to their destination, avoiding the existing obstacles in its path. 
This costly child already has behalf 
A billion dollars that will be applied in several stages with the aim of buying credits bad banks have been prepared by the version written of the law of the packet of financial ransom of 700. 
In the first phase half of the money will wear out.

Magazine of press of the area German-speaking 
The group of right is intact, only that in the group itself the most conscious electors - it states Der Spiegel the on the weak electoral result of CSU in Bavaria. were converted 
Haider and his supporters are ready to govern in Austria to prevent a coalition black and red. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of left Franz Walter, in his article graduate "La of Bavaria devours to his fathers" analyzes the motifs of the dramatic defeat of CSU. 
According to the famous political scientist the erosion of the CSU had begun that a lot people before of the sad duet Beckstein-Huber having assumed its charge. 
Christian Socialists during several decades those kept developing to Bavaria - and now precisely these modern citizens are those that turn on it. 
change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Democracy Christian as well also Angela Merkel. 
failure the was not totally surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was already foreseen since almost ten years ago ended: the indisputable hegemony of a party of state disappeared. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47,7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the fifties. 
This was still repeated three years, in the choices of the Bundestag of 2005, ago that is during the so mentioned one was of Stoiber. 
The reason of that is the consequent modernization of the voracious CSU in the province of their parents. 
Sociologists the already 40 years ago they come predicting this, but in the pace they were mistaken a lot. However, the secularization, results of the education the and the settlement of the Germans of the North in the regions developed of Bavaria had its negative consequences on the faithfulness of the electors of the CSU. 
With the modernization also the possibilities are increased and that equally has political consequences. 
The group of right is intact, only which in the group itself were converted voters more aware, more critical and more mulish. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks precisely the conventional groups of the citizens were those that moved away more of the CSU; the autonomous ones, the small industrial, those that have high school and the holders of a diploma. 
Like this he recudió without 40 per cent support for the CSU. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
The preserving journal of Vienna: Who with whom? In its article graduate "Los presidents of the parties are very reserved in matters of coalition" - it is in charge of the predicament of policy internal after the elections Austrian. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ interfering with its affairs internal.

Werner Faymann the president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to prove that the collaboration between the two matches - this already exists in some provinces and social associations. is possible 
Fayman left pending the question that if it can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice-chancellor. 
It stated that in any case they disapproved of the era of. 
It is not possible to follow this trend policy. 
Mr Molterer reacted cautiously to the offers red. 
He said that the cooperation will probably not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal matters of the ÖVP. 
It is still opened in the party if they will choose the opposition or they will enter in the coalition, these issues must be discussed with no doubt, in the ÖVP itself. 
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions. 
"To prevent the red - black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of the government" - it stated Haider.

Today the European Summit for equal opportunities has been initiated into Paris, its host is France that this year is also ruling president of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, representative of the European People's Party for the Fidesz, in its message directed to the house, as one of the main speakers of this meeting professional, caught the attention about segregation in education, because it is one of the most severe rapes that whip the gypsy children and besides is also the obstacle largest in front of the foundation prevoucher of their interests. 
This conference of high level was inaugurated - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, Minister French of Employment and social matters and by Vladimir Spidla, responsible European commissioner for the employment, matters social and of equal opportunities. 
Representatives of the governments, European and representative social interlocutors of the most important European organizations of protection of the rights social, attended the meeting. 
Járóka - according to the buró of press of the group of representatives of the Fidesz in the - noticed that besides discrimination in employment, the gypsies remain out of the job market in the first place for its low level of schooling. 
"Most of young Roma have not finished the teaching half and due to poor quality of teaching basic, only an insignificant part can obtain diploma university". 
Járóka stood out besides that the education, as basic human law, has a key paper in the foundation prevoucher of the other human rights also. 
The inversion in the teaching of children Gypsy an early age can strengthen the economics of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the European representative, necessary concientizar is these questions among the gypsies as well as among the not gypsy ones widely. 
Then as long as earlier commenced the school a gypsy student, more chance will have to convert in a lively member of the job market; through the ones imposed on the income and consumable they will also contribute to the budget national. 
"To the ones gypsy, as citizens of the, have to be assured by the right them for a education quality and to be guaranteed the abolition of the segregated education and of low level" - it highlighted Lívia Járóka. 
As the European representative, is necessary the Unit objectivizes and activates of the European Union to accelerate immediately the processes of desegregation school, for that the correct fulfillment of the existing and planned antidiscriminatory directives is of importance fundamental. 
"Has that, the gypsy children have to be offered to break the vicious circle of the poverty, the segregation and the unemployment to by the possibility that guarantees the space democratic so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of plenary sessions it laws" - it required Járóka. 
The goal of the European Summit for the Equality of Opportunities organized annually from the meeting from Berlin of the last year that it was celebrated in the sign of the "European Year of equal opportunities", is to guarantee a singular forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and the equality of opportunities at European level and at level national of the states member. 
CSU: Grace for a period transitional 
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the kind of the unsuccessful duet Huber-Beckstein 
In spite of the serious electoral, yet have not been cut heads in the summits of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate has been put off on personal questions. 
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein Prime Minister provincial they still remain in their posts, but it is not known until when the grace will last. 
The kind of the duet, which suffered a catastrophic defeat electoral of 17 per cent, will be decided in the extraordinary congress of the match that will be celebrated last weekend of October. 
The members of the so criticized duet let make out: they do not cling so much to their posts. 
With that they intended to calm down to the furious members of his group and of its organisation, who a day afterwards of the "tsunami Bavarian" required personal consequences due to the loss of the majority absolute. 
Five years ago - although under the address of Edmund Stoiber that was in the top of his career - the CSU reached 60,7 per cent, however now, a year after the blow filled up against Stoiber, they obtained only 43,4 per cent. 
CSU for 46 years the had "monopoly" in Bavaria that it gives 18 per cent of the combined GNP German. 
Although in the province of the South, of key importance for the economy Hungarian, the conservatives keep predominating, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make coalition with somebody. 
As first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice-president Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of the possible successors of Huber, also has a seat in the reduced group of intelligence that initiates negotiations with the FDP liberal and with the Free Electors of right on a possible coalition government in Munich. 
What is strange of the destination is that in the list of enters in the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber use was made for the blow of the duet Huber-Beckstein and afterwards they erased cruelly from stage to the ambitious politics local. 
The maximum leaders of the CSU are inverting now all its energies to stabilize Beckstein. 
In the transition it will receive an active paper Stoiber also that until now it was moving the ropes deep down, the ex-head of provincial government and former president of the CSU qualified the 28 of September as day more bitter of his career political. 
On Monday Huber did some remarks criticism of the CDU, in its opinion they had deserved much more support of the divided brother. 
Other politicians of the CSU interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for the Angela Merkel itself also. 
After the elections in September of 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not capable of enhancing joint to the CSU that had a role key in the successes of the elections national of 2005. 
According to Merkel that hardly could conceal his disappointment by the failure, the leaks of the CSU will not have effects negatively on the grand coalition Berlin. 
Which naturally is relative: it will not be easier to deal to the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats ongoing. 
The SPD with its 18,6 per cent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria. 
opposition of Lukashenko: 
After the choices of's Sunday, there will not be any opposing representative in parliament Belarussian. 
According to the observers Russian, this is explained with the welfare and the stability that guarantees in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, however according to the Organization for the Safety and the Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained with the rapes of the law committed during the conteo of the votes. 
The OSCE that sent 450 observers proceeding from 43 countries, did not recognize the result election. 
although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated per cent and ten members, more than a decade ago it does not have opposition, before the choices of yesterday the opposition joined under the name of Democratic Forces Joined (ODSZ) waited Lukashenko, that for fourth time it renewed its mandate after the elections of 2006 of dubious legitimacy, for consequence of amending the this time "would allow" him entry of some representatives of the opposition in parliament. 
like this the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that originally wanted to do. 
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition it was the that Belorussia, that every time depends more economically on Russia - that it took a loan to moderate the import of gas natural more and more expensive of Russia and that it contributed on sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - it wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which permission of entry does not give him Lukashenko and the other politicians of high level for having a politicial régime considered antidemocratic. 
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, rather placed emphasis on the positive phenomena and not on the mistakes - as for example the prohibition of informing a third of candidates opposition about imposed. 
However the primary report of ’ s Monday of the OSCE criticized even the campaign itself - in which the candidates opposition could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the conteo of the votes. 
With all this in the view of the opposition an improvement is felt in the political climate: the political prisoners remained in released and Minsk is disposed to a small with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of Osetia of the South and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a Federal State - does already a month that considers the two regions as independent. 
We have given two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union - it declared to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich. has begun 
According to the candidate of the opposition of the presidential choices of 2006 it is desirable to maintain this situation, in spite of that "the regime fears to allow the entry of so at least a opponent in this parliament without peso". 
opposition the does not plan to organize demonstrations of protest when seeing the results, it rather tries to do to arrive to the voters his message on the need of doing economic reforms. 
Clear this causes us many problems because we must print the press of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in the face of its distribution, but even like this I see that every time are more those that support the change among the biggest of adults also - said Milinkevich, doing referring to which to the regime of Lukashenko, which thinks that its result main is the creation of the social security, do not consider it adequate even the retired people, the that officially are the most subsidized by the regime. 
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of in the deficit trade, it is just question of time the collapse of the Security Social that "he seems to the silence of the cemeteries" - it opined Milinkevich. 
The Russian observers contrary to the politician of the opposition qualified as democratic to the choices. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the of declared to the Russian agency of news Ria Novosti: "the people do not believe in the words but in the facts" so that the lack of the opposition is not another thing than the testimony of the maturity of the voters Belarussian.

And the Public Administration adds that producing is necessary more effective 
Italian, "which wage dynamics - it explains the minister - in the last 8 - 10 years they have been double with regard to the private sector and well for above of the price of inflation". 
For now millions of public employees have joined to oppose the norms of the decree Brunetta sticking the request supported by the Codacons. 
"While the minister of the shows the numbers, the smallest working ausentismo for causes of illness - it writes the association of conadders -" the people of the 'lazy workers' are in continuous increase.

Every day, in Italy, accidents are verified in the work 2.5, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid. 
For the 2007, the data Inail confirm indeed that the deaths white have been approximately 1.200. 
Ciphers that show the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and provokes almost the twice number of deaths with regard to the homicides. 
To catch the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58 national ° hours for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October.

head of the squeezes its appreciation for constant effort associative the in favor of the prevention in the working place, of the protection of the injured workers, of the assistance to the families of the casualties and of the awareness public. " 
"It has been appeared, one 'is' enough, sincerely shared," in front of tragedies that, for its dimensions, spark off the clamour of media and the participation of opinion, however the daily reality suggests dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics, to us. 
Neapolitan does not hide that "there is a problem of resources without doubt: it is decisive to invest in training and in information. 
Meant individual take the numerous initiatives promoted in school area for a more direct awareness on behalf of the youngsters that enter in the world of work.

"We think that he gets used to general level still too little to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the cure can be exercised through multiple actions. 
They are necessary, to our criterion - it has stood out Mercandelli - greater checks and inspections, but also an intervention stronger on the formation of the workers, and this from the world of the school ".

Today it is initiated, in March it is closed, in June the accounts will be done. 
It is this the timetable set for the Municipality and for the workers of him "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome" that has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Springs of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the principal points deliberated for Rome. 
Once the doors had been closed in March, the junta and the council communal evaluated analysis and projects, in mode of presenting in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bump" of the Municipality and of its intendant Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the ideas political, social and cultural - it tends to underline Alemanno - Will have to provide suggested for the development with Rome in which those that decide politically, the board and the council municipal, will be able to be answered afterwards. 
There is not no needless position of roles, alone the will of having a place to fabricate a great project for Rome. 
In March the work finished it will disappear, because this experience must have one finishes precise storm. 
In June - it announces the intendant - we will present the strategic plan using the work done of the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome ". 
Since their opinions are not binding, Alemanno answers, the one who accuses the of useless: "Everything depends on the work that will be in degree of carrying out the Commission and of the quality of their proposals. 
If the quality will be present, like this as in France with the Commission Attali and as also I am sure in Rome, his contribution will be basic. 
The policy is almost always crushed in the management day-to-day and in emergencies that of back in return are expressed. 
We, on the contrary, want to look but there and in the long term, in a prospective but deep, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and to his future ". 
The intendant of Rome tends to indicate besides that "this Commission is not either a useless entity or a banality: it is absolutely free, not coastal one euro to citizens Roman and will be used for doing to take part and reasoning the best minds that squeezes the capital". 
For Alemanno, indeed, "he needs to have a strategic design as reference, not closed nor immobile, to allow our city to do one I authenticate leap of level, of which we have absolute necessity, thinking with spirit unity to his future". 
A future that, needs the intendant of Rome was not limited alone to the current communal limits but looked but there "not alone in terms of the future city metropolitan and of its status legal of but" also considering the role that Rome can and must unwrap as Capital of Europe and of the Mediterranean ". 
Does Obama? first president anti-American American. 
It has written one I notice American politician that it interests it to pass for independent: "Barack Obama will be the second president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that with their decisions it reduced the economy USES and digestive relations (as it does also today it gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam ". 
They increase the attacks against Obama while the date of the choices comes close. 
it has written a lady of Miami in one Web: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama has a great side of Stone: the charge thinks that it gained but loudly of the nation that has had two governors and five senators black! ". 
In fact they are attacks that they do not say a lot; attacks are of racial nature clearly and they do not answer to the question of the electorate: will he be a good president? And besides the polls are; all say that Obama gained and with a good advantage. 
Also in this case there is the one who talks with the heart but not with the brain. 
A journal of the Misisipi, in the entrails of the south of the United States, has written a publishing company: we will know well once in the booth to vote the one who will give its vote the patriot American. 
one side of the mindset American goes out had cover up to the last one. 
"They say what want, we will think afterwards where to put the cross, if on Obama or on McCain". 
There are people who swear: if he gets to gain Obama, we will leave America. 
never said things before of now, that it seems almost certain the success of the candidate black. 
However in spite of all these arguments, the victorious weapon for the democratic ones is George Bush. 
They have asked to 1500 people: which have been the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 per cent has answered: 
Iraq. 
It changes America. In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent it to home to kicked in the backyard. 
In Iraq they are 4500 the soldiers that have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the valises. 
Equally, Iraq for the majority has been the weakness of Bush. 
The one who will assume the post of George W will have an enormous duty to unwrap. 
It uses, the economic collapse is made feel also for the journalists: in the newspapers it is time of courts. Many give the fault to Internet, "murderous" of the printed paper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been Research Center interpellated by PEW on the state of their profession and of control mental for the future. 
although, today the journalists almost all are pessimistic around their future. 
However, the journalists have not declared openly that they feel less worried on the credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as once. 
problem for journalists Americans the is the money. 
The crisis of the 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model. 
Besides the cuts carried out in the room where the authors work to carry out the newspaper, is a big problem. 
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists had an interview, if it is not wanted for the traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands it to come down substantially. 
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today on the journalist American. 
Six on ten journalists and executives are convinced that the journalism at national level this following a way wrong. 
In the field local the executive group is 65%. 
against emission. 
It is not difficult for the journalists to see where it goes the web. 
By largest houses publishing a gap are opened in Internet, for many it dresses as the "murderer" of the printed card. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists notice has increased even 79%. 
The 500 journalists had an interview have admitted that they are embracing the technology in the expectation "that makes something of good" for the journalism. 
The breaking but big today in the American journalism it is among the one who directs the newspapers - that is the directors - and the journalists that work for them. 
56% of executives at level national is sure that its journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage low to 23%. 
For some this has to do with the "safety of the work". 
The executives who think to lose the job in 3 years are 47% at national level. 
For the journalistic staff it is of 30%. 
That of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always to the agenda. 
Only 13% of the journalists works with a contract. 
In an immense nation as the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radius, TV and Internet the employers often offer the that they want and it is converted like this in a matter of take it or leave it ". 
The directors almost always receive good wages, while the editors can gain up to 10 thousand dollars per month, but the retirement and the social aseguración. 
For the holidays the reasoning is made complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to arrive at 15 days full after a certain number of years. 
but the American journalists, by admission of his, he "fall ill" following during the year. 
a matter of climate is everything. 
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to refuse the application of the property one Danilo Coppola that it had asked that he could be moved of his home town, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola this inquired into by bankruptcy in the area of the research on the pact disadvantage related to the climbing Unipol-Bnl. 
In the course of the process of arrest to his office, last week, he has obtained the liberation home, transforming it into obligatory residence to Grottaferrata. 
Its lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the property one can go over the route of the city of the province room of the capital up to one. 
According to the court these journeys (therefore the pm has given vote contrary) would allow him to influence their society and to access the proofs that show it. 
elites in danger 
The phenomenon had already appeared some days behind with the vote of the camera of the representatives against the plan of salvation of 700 million dollars started off through the White Home: a significant part of Americans was, and this, but interested to punish Wall Street that to overcome the economy. 
It gives us one confirms the New York Times yesterday informing us that the crisis in progress is disarming the Party, always but divided up between its old soul of the, moderate East Coast, favorable to the institutions federal and to the business community, and its new soul, however, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington » and to the world of the finances, particularly forts in the states of the Center and of the South. 
The soul, in fact, that it has been converted prepowerful with the vote of the one who talked at first. 
This as soon as mentioned one example of the mutations is alone, of the big ones mutations, that the earthquake economic in progress announces: not alone in the United States but in all the West and not alone here only. 
It is in the United States as in Europe since some time ago the crisis seems to work as accelerator of phenomena of incubation that with the new climate they are solidified and they go out to the light. 
The first of these phenomena is the D update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double state - sovereignty category in relation to a type of nationalisation D of the economy. 
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking houses - would finance that have, if, strong relations you would finance with the outside, but above all are jeopardized much more the balances of the families that live in a single country and in a single state. 
The one that he considers immediately a political problem for the one who governs it: that is how to answer to the difficulty and to the protests of those people and of those families that, on the other hand they are electors. 
The crisis appears economically worldwide but it is national politically and exclusively. 
The political internationalism seems substantially outside stake or they do not have a lot to say: the test crucial is the European Union that divided up as always between the various interests and the various strategies state does not reach to decide no policy in common. 
It is the subsidy of funds of the government of every state that all are waited an intervention, plans of rescue and of reactivation, of new rules and particularly: from the moment that is arrived to court the state that has the economic resources and the mass of resources is alone to finance you to remedy the things. 
And they have also the resources necessary and the legitimation to use them: two resources invaluable values in certain circumstances in which any market probably and no organization will ever be able to have in the same measure. 
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state - nation is in perfect harmony, with the utmost importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute a very allied factor to this element: the territoriality. 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced to always have entered in the network of technology but had sophisticated, of the immaterial one, while we were convinced that the global finanza was already destined to dominate the world, we gave account that our future will have however to do the auditors every time but with things little intangible such as water, the crops and the oil. 
All things that, fix yourself, can be certainly transported of one place to the other one of the land but are equally joined in all in a space, a territory, limited. 
So the one who is found as sovereign, possesses certainly many but cards with regard to the one who is not it, and to the one who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water. 
I arrive to the second novelty that but presages a fracture. 
The one who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy and Leadership. 
In this sense the economic crisis seems to cause two phenomena convergent. 
On the one hand the awareness objectivizes of the need for one leadership, the request of one that knows how to take the situation in hand. 
On the other hand a wave of discredit to the leaders existing, of relieved economic sort inadequate with many areas grey. 
and joint something but deep and in a sense disturbing: a discredited, an intolerance, an inadequate image a sense of remoteness, that tends to implicate the entire ruling class of the countries of in an increasing number. 
It seems to advance always more, in various parts of the population the conviction than before that their actions are them as those of the social elites until now growing, the same mode of feeling and of to be, its culture in the exception understanding of the finish, to have done the time itself and to be but strange to the views of the majority. 
The demand for leadership, in a brief way, feeds in an underground way a divided but powerful movement of delegitimisation of the classes ruling and of the structures political traditional, that they demonstrate in a revolt ’ electoral or in the sudden changes of collective humors of these last times, from the preserving exit in Austria - Baviera to the collapse of the social - democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the Congress American against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has to do something). 
It is had the impression that the traditional elites, its matches their programmes, but also its rites its newspapers, his intellectual authorized, its format would say one, always do more difficulty to understand and then to represent, what since today that is taking shape are the strata profound of society Western and the economic crisis renews growing and shakes potentially in excessive. 
Of in front of all this to talk of join "rebellion of masses » nowadays is frankly exaggerated. 
But to have the open eyes certainly is not it. 
The super glue to walk on the walls 
Beating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walking on the walls as the man scratches. 
It is the goal of several centres research Americans and a team of four institutes has now come quite a lot close. 
With a badge of only 2.5 cm the scientists squared have been able to have a body of 100 kilos stuck on a wall vertical. 
THE STUDY - magazine American the has published the discoveries of some investigators of the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and of Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by team of researchers is an evolution of the existing that they use a single grain structure of the carbon, called nanotubes of carbon. 
« principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaguettis » explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta. 
Scientists the have been inspired to the leg of the gecos, covered with microscopic hairs that can guarantee a grip perfect to the animal. 
The test done on different materials, as the glass, teflon and sandpaper, have proved that the new badge is ten times but powerful of the ducks of this reptile and to the same one time "he takes off easily of the walls » explains Liming Dai, investigative of enables it of Engineering of the University of Dayton. 
WALKING FOR THE WALLS? - "This material could be useful as temporary adhesive » adds Liming Dai. 
Layers to walk for the walls exactly as the man scratches? Layers yes, but the investigators think to a use a lot less gripping as the connection among electronic devices, because the nanotubes of carbon are drivers of heat and of electric current. 
Other applications could have to which to see with the engineering aerospace. 
For the moment nothing of superheroes. 
ANOTHER INVESTIGACION - Also the University of Berkeley, in California, is dedicating itself in search of a new badge. 
In an article of the magazine American Chemical Society, the studious Californians have presented an adhesive done of micro fibres as 8m that itself auto clean of the dust during the movement on a surface always to maintain a perfect grip. 
Drugs: never with juice of fruit 
Attention to the juice of grapefruit, to that of orange and to that of apple. 
These drunk, consummated especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if they are taken contemporarily with some drugs its absorption is altered amplifying or decreasing according to the case, the efficiency with consequences serious for health. 
To repeat the risk of the juices of fruit they are packed that fresh David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, associated with the assumption of some medicinal that from the national 236esimo meeting of American Chemical Society in progress to Philadelphia sends a new: a glass of toys of fruit, of orange and of apple to reduce the absorbimiento of some drugs, is enough nullifying the effects beneficial and putting the health of patients to risk. 
The juice of grapefruit was already been under accuses because it was retained responsible of increasing some medicinal anti arhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistaminic and neurological at levels toxic. 
FARMACOS to RISKS - same agency Italian of the drug the had given the news in a bulletin of information two years behind alarming medical and patient not to underestimate the danger that derived from this mixture and to put attention to something is drunk in the case is being assumed a drug as for example the to Diasepam or the Metadone. 
NOT ALONE THE GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts also exuberance of orange juice and that of apple contain substances that inhibit the drugs. 
A long list of the active beginnings inhibited by the grapefruit and other juices. 
Of here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the state University of Milano:"Estos discoveries in general comes indicated to the several of the agencies drug international and national that eventually provide to change the informative notes of it. 
that's why the leaflets illustrative always has to be read of the medicinal that they are assumed and if there is something that it does not have clear us, not to leave us to impress, to ask clearly to the doctor to the when pharmacist » underlined the expert of the agency Anase. 
The Novel of economics to Paul Krugman 
The nobel prize of economics has been assigned to the American Paul Krugman by their studies, its models of trade and on the location of the economic activities. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a Keynesian neo that shows to the University of Princeton and is one I notice leader writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the oldest reviewers of the decisions of the administration of Bush as for the economy and to the foreign policy. 
Few months after the attack of the 11 of September of the 2001, on those days che cracked Enron, Krugman had foreseen in a publishing company published by the New York Times that the second event serious but definitive that the first, in you finish of consequence for the States United. 
A forecast that I unchain much controversy and that for several years came reproached the economy for, but that now has been revealed exact. 
« I am surprised and a little troublesome for as the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and of Worldcom they have disappeared quickly of the attention of the public », had declared Krugman to die it of the 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the committee executive of the banking central European, Krugman is a "economist of big value », but also a divulgator with one style" very aggressive, particularly reviewer against the excesses of liberalism of the administration of Bush ». 
Open Office, echo the third edition of the packet "anti - Microsoft » 
It is on day of the promotion of the OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that looks always to attract but utilizadores, from the home to the office to the profesionistas of the public administration, as alternative free to the well-known Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost one year on behalf of the voluntary developers, of whom its backs are supervised by SUN Microsystem the new open office is shown to the public with several innovations: to the screen of welcome and to the interface magazine less crude, others are added but consistent, as the compatibility for the system operating Apple Mac OS X and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, version standard ISO finalizes it. 
Attention put also to the multi-functioning with the suite Office 2007, Open Office is in degree of opening the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting some functions you specify of some modules as that one that allows to reduce the dimension of the presentation of PowerPoint, useful for example, to send it via fun electronic, or the possibility to import the have PDF in the modulate of grafica elaboration, preserving the aspect original of paginates it. 
They can always on this front be created documents "PDF hybrids", that they accumulate the typical grafica of the format of Adobe with elements of a road calculation or of one elaborating of text. 
The Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements in the interior of the aplicativos: in road calculation the they can take part in various users, avoiding the conflicts of you modify them, in preparation of texts the, to each collaborator it comes a colour given in the comment for a better recognition in stage of revision. 
Some companies are also working to take some functions of OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the outcome final. 
The version in Italian can unload in direction at http the: / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html and itself add to the groins that it was in the mirror since Friday. 
Besides that for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the system operating Linux. 
To request also the cd of installation to home or to the work can be sent. 
and if the subject of the free one can be a hook for the dissemination on houses, it is in business area that Open Office the suite test, tries the big one bet, being able already to have with several projects carried out in the public administration and at schools. 
and even the realities that offer a service of training do not miss, consultations and of ideal assistance for the small and medium companies, in which they could be opened prospective of business. 
Open Office is composed by five main modules: Writer, for the video notarizes the corresponding one of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel spreadsheet; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of known access is the program that allows to work in the dates basis; and for I finalize Draw the modulate grafico. 
for 2008 is of arriving at 5 million download, and considering that until today we arrive to almost already 3 million 600 a thousand, with the departure of the version new it is probable that the planned cipher can be surpassed. 
is positive is the fourth case of doping 
New positive case in the Tour de France: Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, is talked about the Austrian one third classified and winning of the best rower of the climber.

If the against tests they confirm that it is positive, the Austrian one will waste the third since the and wrath against both years of canonical disqualification. 
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the Epo of third generation the head of the agency French is antidoping, Pierre Bordry, that he has declared to the Associated Press of having notified the Austrian authorities about the news. 
The Austrian one of 26 years has been positioned in the podium to the backs of Spaniard Carlos tailor and of the American Cadel Evans, the rower of the best climber being granted. 
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK YOU SWINDLE SE QUESTION, ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italy of country of emigrant has been transformed into a destination privileged alone recently for the immigrants "received with hostility. 
Is this transforming the country beautiful into a nation of racist? It is the that to the debate about the issue is asked the New York Times in a long article that has dedicated racism in Italy breaking up of the case of the youngster Abdul William Guibre originario of Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for having stolen a box of galletitas. 
This case makes evident what the New York Times defines the "paradox of the north": regions Northern are at the same time those where they are registered "but integration and but work" but also the but high feeling of the country and the hold but loudly of the League ". 
As it confirms the New York Times of the increasing tension among Italian and immigrant it has mentioned also the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not alone. 
Also the new legislation wanted by the Layman squeezes the brake on immigration and facilitates the ejection from the clandestine ones is mentioned as paradigm of the cambiamiento of the climate in Italy. 
Marked trend is for the Pope that for the president of the: "Giorgio Napolitano finding to Benedetto XVI in the Congress has asked that the State and the church work joint to fight the racism". 
Estudiantes you kill of the expensive rent, up to 900 euros through a room 
The market of rental for graduates does not know the crisis. 
According to the last enquiry of the Sunia the union of the tenants, to rent a single room could be difficult for a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoles, 600 to Rome. 
"the phenomenon has already assumed characteristics very serious up to the point of excluding the law to studying many of young people for the very high costs that the family should hold - the one responsible for the office explains studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the demand strong has totally deformed the market to such a point of unchaining a process of generalized increase even for the resident ones". 
To part that in most of the cases the offers of contain a series of violations: standard contracts free, not registered, unlimited of canon, linked sub rents. 
For Sunia they are necessary interventions extraordinary that, through the review of taxation, can be established for the prices regulations. 
Looking in detail at the enquiry, we see that in Milan, for a bed in area Brianza approximately 450 EUR act; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (area Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine and Wild Animal) to a maximum of 900 (in area victory). 
In Florence a bed costs in average of 350 / 400 euros, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologne, where the students concentrate on areas near the, 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for an individual one act. 
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Bologna Post) they ask you for approximately 600 euros through a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room. 
Alone values slightly but basses (550 euros through a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
economy is done only if peripheral area is changed: 300 euros per bed and 450 through a single room in area Prenestina, Centocelle and nearby. 
In Naples for a bed they serve you 300 / 450 euros, by a room it is used up from 400 at 600 euros, with the prices but high in the areas Policlínico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari for a bed they serve you 250 / 350 euro, at least 350 for an individual. 
in the cities but girls the prices are but low in you finish absolute, but has greater weight in the economy of the city. 
In the cities as in Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and outside is but frequent, a further anomaly is registered: an increase of 25/30% / 30 of the canon to students foreign on the Italians. 
Good-bye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historical rooms 
The historical cinematographic rooms close favoring the Multiplexes. 
"A city without halls cinema in city blind a, is as a face without eyes". 
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the large centres urban Italians and also in cities of province. 
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, that with the birth of the big meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in areas central of the city, is an event inevitable indisputably with all the characteristics of a genuine crime cultural. 
Almost always to disappear they are places historic, full of memory it is as if a friend, an acquaintance » that « a piece of place and so much » was shared » with, « died » notes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago I gain the cousin behind Oscar and the great prize of jury Cannes, that it had the poem of a room of cinema of province and the nostalgia for the mode of living the cinema that lost perhaps forever. 
The ciphers given by the Anec, the main association of the traders, talk clear: in the past five years they have closed 316 cinemas traditional, and to pay the most part rooms of the major cities are overcoats: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions but suffered by the closing are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, continuing for Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
It is a demonstration that the one responsible for his disappearance is the avenimiento of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have made register the biggest number of new meticones cinemas are own: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 or in Tuscany that in Emilia-Romagna. 
« The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally » observes Paolo Protti president of the, "would be tool that was built by new structures but it would be needed to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a room of city closes, not all its frecuentadores are ready to be transferred to the meticones. 
Because it does not talk about the lack of funds in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is of approximately 10 million euros. 
It is shameful from the point of view ethical and moral, that the government does not respect the laws that exist. 
To sustain the sector it would serve » between 16 and 18 billion « to the year ». 
Interesting the case of Bologne, the first Italian city that worried by the closing, decided to be repaired with the firm of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and to supervise the cinema monkey room is in the centre historic that in the periphery. 
Among the planned norms they exist mediated of providing fiscal plus of the managers and advantages for the public in you finish of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter in the area of I deal limited and will have special fees for the deployment. 
« Is an initiative that me likes » observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I wait that other cities follow the example of Bologna putting other measures standing. 
It is true, that for contrasts the power extra of the meticones, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and of the image because the public today is but demanding. 
defence of cinema traditional the is a subject that for me was always important: the closing of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to carry out the "New cinema Paradiso" that it already thought since 10 years ago. 
Alive in Rome since 25 years ago, and when crossing in front to the Rialto or to the Quirinale of track Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many emotions shared, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn myself for the other one side ». 
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to make the choices of the Municipality for the interested ones to the cosca Piromalli uniform". 
Are weighing you accuse them that the magistrates of the anti-Mafia Address of Calabria give the intendant and the vice intendant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosary Schiavone, and to the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association. 
Also Gioacchino Piromalli the elderly mediator arrested among the clan and the public administration, and its grandson lawyer opposite number of boss shops, already condemned by association criminal mafia-like and to pay indemnity 10 million euros. 
"Despising any standard legal and moral, and of good sense", they write the prosecutors, the two authorities local had expressed the will of paying consultations to the lawyer Piromalli. 
"The Mafia family - they write the judges - of entering officially to internal the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and of command would have been allowed of the public administration". 
The president of the regional board calabrés Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements among the bad organized life there is one heap" in its region: "There are areas in where the intensity mafia is but strongly that in others, where the agreement is almost unavoidable. 
but there are so many local politicians that withstand at the pressure of him 'ndrangheta, heroes that are maintained clean ". 
The ones arrested of this morning are added to those of the last July afterwards that the police had announced the cut of heads of the Mafia family Piromalli. 
From the ends of last April, the municipal board of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and, the local politicians had always for supposed conditioning among the organized criminality and the local administration been solevados of the assignment of administering the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendant, of the Udc to the time of the dissolution, after the balotaje to May of 2006, had been elect as head of a right coalition of centre-right. 
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture I order the dissolution of the council municipal. 
I call in cause to the vice minister of the interior that in this time was Marco Minniti, accusing it of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the capias signed this morning they explain that Piromalli had even gotten to ask for the variance of the project of the road A3. 
Of the interceptions set them done To Dal Torrione, write the judges, emerges "him availability to favor the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very near to the clan Piromalli, making uniform the choices of the public administration on the interests of the families members of the mafia". 
When the energy originates from the waves, they take the big ones down to the scene 
It is an exterminated bed that it occupies but of 70% of the surface of the planet and, the big companies global of energy, are discovering it now. 
Waves, ordinary, tides are the new renewable fountains on which they look at the big ones as Chevron. 
The possibility to raise energy of the movements of sea is studied since a hundred years ago and in the seventies together with first crisis, the investigations intensified. 
When the price of oil under, in 1980, the idea about making use of the energy marine was put aside, but now that the cases of environment and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has estimated for the 2007 that 15 per cent of the need global could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea. 
This quantity would be the double of the one produced at present through the nuclear power stations. 
And besides the currents and the tides would be. 
to the attack. 
The first company to bet on the sea energy has been Enersis, which the 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal. 
When the intention was announced a step revolutionary seemed. 
At two years of distance to bet on the energy marine they are always but and among these companies those that have always voted for the energy traditional. 
"Chevron is studying the technology on the ocean energy - has declared the spokesman of a company associated to the has to the American oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and it is evaluating the possibility to cooperate with us. 
Cooperation in question is on the obtaining of a license of the commission for the American energy, to carry out a project to exploit the sea energy in Alaska. 
It is one signal quite important, if it is considered that in Alaska the USA continue to extract oil and the president Bush has recently activated a plan to carry out new drilling. 
Besides Chevron Verdant Power Inc is. of New York and Ocean Power de New Jersey to follow the path of the energy that comes of the sea, the total inverted until now, even if they are not detailed indicate an interest in increase. 
Technology to develop. 
The experts talk about a technology still at first, because the energy marinates there are not doubts that a huge impact environmental has. 
For now the impacts as those Portuguese or the Scots are of small scale and do not seem to create big problems to the ecosystem. 
To cause energy to long scale a technology must be used with a greater impact environmental. 
And the choices are several: for example, Ocean Power uses a system of boas joined among them. 
strength of waves, that it does to move the boas up and down is converted in hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders to the intern of them. 
The pressure makes a generator turn a turbine that in turn it feeds. 
The electricity is sent to the coast through undersea cables. 
For now they are four the implants of this type in the process of developing, waiting alone of the federal approval, to part of the energy, could serve to for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, already however produces energy for a centre commercial and for a parking, using turbines offshore in the East River of New York. 
the movement of water when there are tides, makes the palettes of the turbines turn, creating a revolving movement that the generator nurtures. 
Verdant has said that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy. 
After the waves tides. 
A particular interest, say in the Institute for the development of the energy electrical, merita in this moment the potential of the tides. 
Although it is an phenomenon intermittent the tides are but preventable that the wind, the sun or the waves and because of that but reliable as source of energy. 
It is especially that states as New York, Maine and Alaska, joint to others that approach at the coasts have inverted 7 million and a half of dollars in 2008 on the energy of the tides and a reversal of 35 million is planned for the 2009.
