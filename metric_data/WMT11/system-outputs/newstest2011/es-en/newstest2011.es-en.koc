What is it? The ČSSD in Prague to unfamiliar with voldemort or cake
The new councillors of ČSSD in the capital will have to overcome language barriers, it seems obvious to the members of the board of Prague and the local council to understand their renewed colleagues from the ODS.
The period aktuálně.cz "examined" to the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when they ruled Prague current members of the coalition.
The dictionary coded using the cream Prague policy during the previous period, the mayor Pavel bém, includes some of the characters, situations and causes more known of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been confirmed that the new councillors almost not understand these known concepts.
At least, so they say.
"who is voldemort?"
"The truth is that I do not know."
"rather, I am a rookie in the praguense policy," he said during the examination of terminology of 'colegueo "the councillor for culture Lukáš kaucký.
And as far as the veteran political, reacted as Karel Březina.
Perhaps aware of the concept 'hole of golf ."
"It is perhaps the only expression of all that I preguntasteis that use from time to time."
"If not, do not normally use slang."
The glossary, whose definitions published the paper aktuálně.cz last June before Congress for a vote of the ODS, chose six examples, in particular those which are particularly connected with the authorities in Prague.
The Socialists had to explain concepts voldemort, '"greatest" golf hole of Prague ,"" go to the cake, "" back of the head of bull, "" treason of the capital "and" shield ."
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, antonín weinert, which in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr dolínek, refused to do so.
"I am in these things and I think to assess how we enjoy the civic democrats."
"What I do care about is how we will understand one another in the implementation of our programs," said.
As has been seen, supposedly the councillor Lukáš kaucký had not realised that the previous title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of the former Mayor bém, Roman janoušek.
To kaucký the word 'voldemort "not told anything; the only word that was right in the review is" the largest golf hole of Prague ."
"This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký immediately, it adds: "but rather what I know about the news."
"I am going to have to point to a course of languages," joke.
Karel Březina is not the only one which recognises in the hole of golf the tunnel blanka, but also the environment councillor Lukáš plachý.
Later, both social-democrat groups know who is really Lukáš voldemort and plachý even knows where to find that character; moreover, the meaning of "go to the cake."
"I think that means going to a company of Prague"; soon it reveals to plachý that it is the headquarters of the janoušek companies.
Like Březina, suggests that such knowledge the got out of the news, but that is not using this vocabulary.
According to participants in the test, between the Social-Democrat Groups there is no glossary so familiar in colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but it seems that we do not have anything like that."
"rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or do games of words with the names," says the President of the ČSSD praguense, Petr hulínský, whose party colleagues call hulda.
"at school I called bříza, but I do not know if my colleagues I also call as well," admits his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party colleagues, weinert is děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, dědek ("old"), the representative, Miroslav poche, which teamed up before the election deception over the sponsorship of the Party, receives the nickname of "igráček" ("Playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only language that the Social-Democrat Groups tolerated in the talks within the party.
To hulínský not likes him, but the newspaper called hulda aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this President praguense.
"The doctor of the rights of truncheons" appears recalls that Petr hulínský received his doctorate in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of the "witches," according to published in a pamphlet
Women as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to have an advanced age, they cannot work, for example, for reasons of health, are unmarried and not have children.
Women who are "relapse" witches are sent to an isolated area, not to harm the rest of the people.
"men rarely suffer such but."
"nor is it isolates healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso is in a special residence for more than a hundred women driven out of their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure."
Issued an information leaflet which should help to avoid the witch-hunt.
However, this has a drawback.
"more than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warns the newspaper Die standard on the disadvantages of awareness in writing.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In wins, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the week died ammy hemmah, 72 years, when three women and two men the tortured, covered in petrol and burned.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman he set in the oil that is used to the unciones rituals.
They set on fire when the group wanted to "get rid of the bad spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" supporting people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a businessman of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "the devoradores of human souls always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to appease the witch-hunt, in Gambia last year still participated in it the President.
"The President gambiano jammeh, following the death of his aunt, launched a broad of the witch hunt which, supposedly, had been linked to his death and had tried to kill the President himself through the magic Negro."
"to help it brought to shamans from nearby Guinea, protected by police officers, soldiers and the staff of the President, were the force randomly selected men and women between the peoples gambianos to the ownership of the President in kanilai," points out in his report the organization Amnesty International.
In the building, those arrested had to drink a herbal potion effects drugs which, moreover, are causing intestinal problems and kidney.
Two of the arrested not survived the stay in the building.
Following international pressure, finally liberated around a thousand people have been arrested.
The caretaker of bakala: warms stoves with coal and signing a higher rent
The man, the elderly and robust, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the customers of the company byty rpg "tycoon coal" zdeňek bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm was about documents with the new rental agreements of Three floors: yours, your daughter and your son, who is serving judgment.
The three of them looting the liberalisation of the rent.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the son will pay from next year 4.100 crowns for a flat in two separate kitchen stays second category.
"In addition, does not have hot water and heating is based on a boiler of solid fuel," shows the finger at the man in the new contract of their son, on whose signature has full powers.
"But what I signed," explains the angry, means resigned.
The civil partnership bytyokd.cz, who described the new conditions of rent as "incorrect and dishonest," recommends that the tenants who do not sign new contracts and to wait on 7 December, the date that will publish a guide on how to proceed in such cases.
But, before that, the man only a shrug.
"everyone says one thing," says with bad side.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory evidence of liberalisation.
After the new year will be with the great majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a rent regulated.
That is why, aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The waiting room of mining rpg is one of the four in Ostrava and the Tuesday at 9 p.m., it was already full.
Just beside the door are the security guards and his side a machine for picking number.
"rent 2011," can be read in a shining button of his touch screen.
The pulsarlo, leaves the machine a papelito with a number.
Almost no time or to read "157" and already the number appears on the big screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Soon after, a marriage of old people to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rent.
The majority of people come to solve problems, as usual, applications of arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with new rental agreements will arrive in Ostrava in the setting of the tenants of the majority of the 44 apartments belonging to rpg around the middle of November.
Rpg in the letters byty proposes an increase in the rent of between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November, opens a window in the centre of attention to the customer for the new rent.
"It has been operating a week, so that is beginning," Oh, after hesitating briefly, workers who are in it when the customer is presented as a journalist.
The liberalisation and the old flats for miners of bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, already tried high and clear the Vice-President of Parliament, originating in Ostrava, Lubomír zaorálek, the ČSSD, and now appear in the newspapers of the area.
"twenty years later I want a new soil."
"neither I changed the stupid bath dish," it desahoga man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, by the time they come mostly pensioners to check if they receive a discount on the rent if you sign in time, as promised by the special offer rpg.
Also will receive half of the discount on the rent February the remaining tenants to sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the 'liberalisation' mining certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"The 360 customers who were here yesterday, just asked for rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimated the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, rpg proposes on the web and in their pieces make individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two sides do not reach an agreement on the lease, should resolve the issue an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but information on the only possible way of proceeding and completely in accordance with the law," warns rpg in its pages.
"We are not going to judge anyone," says one of the employees of byty rpg and a man in the street towards the centre of attention to customer gives him, at least in part, to the right.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and there are 5,000 for lunch; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately employed sows doubt.
"We will see."
"Mr zaorálek media warns them not to sign, so perhaps the people expect," says.
The regulation of rent it will cease to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to byty rpg, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary to the maintenance of the Fund to the Community," recalls Pavel klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company byty rpg, who adds that the neglected state fund that angry Community to the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 rpg was able to rent apartments to invest in four billion, in the four years that Iran from 2011 to 2014, the number will rise to 200 million.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, with seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data which highlighted in red.
"The increase in the rent in 2011 in a 15% and less applies to 31.200 apartments, is to say, more than 90% of the properties of rpg."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum 7,50 Czech crowns per month per square metre," stated on the screen.
Only a 38% increase in the rent of 400 flats of the portfolio of rpg.
"in such cases, this is an increase from an extremely low, 19,66 Crowns per square metre," suggests rpg.
In 2.6 flats, the rent will remain unchanged in the next year.
Rpg byty promises that liberalisation will not affect of blow to rents, but escalará between four to eight years.
Moreover, adds the following compromise: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (look at the graph) again in the flats, mainly in saving on heating: new windows and heating.
People will have priority to sign the agreement of rising rent.
The architects have understood that the offices also need nursery
The administrative building avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company arch.design.
No one would say that is also a small nursery in her home with everything they own to such facilities: walls of colours, furniture creative and even a miniature park in the terrace outside.
Since October last year, can go to the children of employees of arch.design.
The company arch.design architectural projects, whose study took numerous buildings in Brno, thought since the first designs of the building avriopoint to include a space for their miniguardería.
In the company they work around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and allow the arquitectas and delineantes could return soon to work after maternity leave.
Along with the possibility of a reduced timetable, the nursery is one of the benefits offered by arch.design their workers in the framework of its social agenda.
The construction and arquitectas thus have the possibility of combining a profession demanding in the care of the children.
The miniguardería was an idea of the employees of arch.designu and, with the support of the leadership, managed to get funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The miniguardería enterprise is funded through the European Social Fund under the operational programme for human resources and employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (an allocation of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, to recruit qualified staff and services.
When leaves the funding (two years), the company arch.design has the obligation to maintain the miniguardería with their own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and in the presentation of the application for funding helped the company economy rating.
The attention of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; moreover, they are present throughout the day for their care, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education. The nursery currently is home to children with no age limit, although the majority of them have less than three years.
Given that this is a "miniguardería," so can only accommodate simultaneously to a maximum of five children, but with the stakes go more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, independently of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is a lesson and individual care, the content of the programme of the miniguardería are comparable to the programme of the usual pre-school education.
In it the children not only play, but they also receive a quality education: from the basic education to prepare for the school, taught to English.
Not only has the kinds of toys and games of table, but also of a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself to create an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of collect late to children when the school is far from their place of work.
So, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this causes naturally a relationship of trust between the employee and the employer.
In this way, arch.design agreements between companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support to the family and, in short, this programme reinforced the marketing of staff.
The home of the bones still fascinando after 100 years of Gaudí home observed.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lagarto, ladders reminiscent of the backbone of a dinosaur and balcony seem to the mouth of a fish open.
So is the Casa batlló, in Barcelona, the architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its shape similar to a skeleton, the premises of the apodaron 'the home of the bones. "
Organic forms, their colors, the use of the novel, the fragments of stone tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and the ubiquitous lines curvadas softly, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front page of the home oneiroid plays with lines and colors, taken out of the texturas sensitive nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, there is a degree of flexibility, pace and an order carefully considered.
By the evening, the entire facade of the home looks even more impressive, since that is illuminated in such a way that improves the pale colours.
Serpentea and torsión of the ways we still surprised at his home.
The wood ondulada copy window frames, the barandillas, the decorations of the doors, the mirillas and signs.
The Casa batlló, which is in the district of eixample in the number 43 of the lively street commercial passeig de grácia, emerged from the renovation of a House of the year 1877 the architect Emilio room polite.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the home was completed in the year 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep batlló, initially insisted the previous building and start from scratch, but soon accepted the idea of Gaudí reconstruction of a novel and cheaper.
However, the Casa batlló, made up of various apartments not devised Antoni Gaudí only.
It has assisted in the design of the architect Josep Maria jujol.
Indeed, in their levels of the project arose ornaments for the apartment is representative of the owner of the property and mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa batlló was the start of the successful collaboration of jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol took part in the construction of the home milá and park güell of Gaudí, they are in other parts of the same.
Due to their organic form, the premises shortly after their completion the apodaron 'the home of the bones. "
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows started to call it 'the home of the yawns. "
It also says that, at the top of the building, the sword of St George, pattern of Catalonia.
Other elements of the building escultóricos hidden religious reasons.
Gaudí cast in the home, a single system for the time of central heating ventilation and air vents and chimneys characteristic.
It may be strange his inclination of forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí not respect the rules for construction of the moment and refused to be influenced by them.
Even so, the building got permission concerned from the outset, though obviously it data indicated on the reconstruction scheduled were so vague that, two years after its completion, the city was so shocked with the result that asked to be corrected.
He resented, for example, that the construction included columns even until the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never carried out, quite the contrary: only 15 days after the request of the city, Josep batlló demanded (and got) permission to rent the top two floors of the building.
In the lower floors was the owner.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room on the third floor and the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was hired at a jewellery.
The House, six flats, which by a staircase that leads up to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all angles and lines honest, cubriéndolos walls bendy.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of the space.
The common part can connect completely by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without any problems, without renouncing the privacy needed for more intimate.
The House, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only won a new façade, but also a roof unusual and two additional floors.
Also impressive is how plays Gaudí with light blue and white tiles, covering the internal courtyard and tragaluces.
The game with two colors provide the maximum of light on all floors of the House.
Was based simply on the principle that the target reflects more light than the dark colours, which instead absorb the rays of sun.
Any person can visit the Casa batlló, who in 2005 was added to the list of World Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
On the first floor of the House is the apartment more espacioso and more full of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, during the 150º anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With visits confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very profitable business and widened the visits to the area and to the attic, including the terrace of the roof.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, reaches 16,50 euros, although students, pensioners and the holders of the tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí building in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of bed with its towers should be friend quickly lagarto, a resident of the neighbouring houses and visit him at home.
How it chooses the mattress and the somier: men and women want different things
Nothing of a pompous to bed; what really as a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
Above all they must be complemented perfectly to suit specific users.
During the election, many factors come into play, including height, weight, sex and state of health of the owner.
It is also important to the kind of Interior for the mattress and the somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a herd of weekend which often has no heating, must not be used because látex cushions are "warm" more slowly.
In addition, usually weighing considerably more than the usual polyurethane foam cushions.
It is therefore necessary to around them more often.
If not properly aired the channels of the centre and, above, are on a firm footing, kept within the humidity moho. Even can appear below.
When it comes to choosing a bed, also influence the customs.
Anyone who has spent much time abroad, often uses a cushion very high with a soft layer and will have problems to cope in an area more low and hard.
"almost all the hockey players who returned to the NHL complained that there were sleeping as well."
"for their pulverised shoulders, heels and caderas needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelástica."
"This kind of mattresses are recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so that they are wrong information of the skin, joints," explains hadamcziková Sylva, which specializes in the acolchado furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, time-consuming preferring the viscoelástica cushions.
"Today there is no problem, because they have the appropriate magniflex tempur and Italians, but also the Czech brand tropico."
There are no longer to be a player in the NHL to see the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" in a way very simple.
Optimises its rigidity and form on the basis of the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, will not look like after a hard game.
Simply, they slept better.
The viscoelástica also functions as protection against the wounds.
By choosing the size of the mattress, add up the length of their feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example of singles, is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a standard simple to calculate their wide: the lying down, should be comfortably encogidas towards the elbow," advises the Helena prokopová, an expert in engineering cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, which has been around for many years dealing with the problems of sleep healthy and the ergonomics of the furniture, which specialised in mainstream schools.
In twin rooms, each one needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to put the somieres to different stage, which is not always possible in all the beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum of 14 cm, high-end models with internal docks a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three inch are for the layer that adapts to the forms and edges.
"to touch it with a hand or sitting on the bed, certainly should not be perceived the docks," warns Helena prokopová.
Each mattress requires a kind of somier determined.
The bedrooms completely acolchados, in which the mattress and the basis are as siameses, does not make sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses are breathing poorly and cannot wash their forms, which today is often.
And, given that every night transpiramos between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a great (and crowded) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists reject the slogans that talk of a life of the cushion of up to 25 years or, even, of a guarantee for life.
However, everything has a but.
So, sellers are taking a Council: in the mattresses with a breadth of 120 or 140 cm, covering carefully cleaning and brainwashing the forms, but better add a protective buffer that can be withdrawn and wash easily.
Although currently manufactured fundas of mattresses with closure of one-for-one system on its shores, so that the open are in two parts (something very important for the overhead and the size of the washing machine!), his manipulation in the larger models (and for a single person) to lift the mattress may seem like a bout between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a somier, does a table firm?
Never!
As much for the beds designed to dock overnight visits.
However, it should make you (if not already) ventilation holes in the table and must be used with a cushion with docks in the interior and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in pockets (like the German taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
The mattresses of polyurethane foam should not be used on such databases.
For the somieres of leading-edge not articulables and containing between 14 and 18, can be used as látex cushions and mattresses sandwich (for example, a combination of látex and fiber of Coco), although it is always better to a somier with a greater number of leading-edge, 28 or more, in which the leading-edge scrapie area are strengthened and they can regulate its rigidity.
The somieres of leading-edge articulables should not be used with a cushion of docks, since we do not react to the reclinación.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the leading-edge, you can also use the protection of the shoulders.
This is a special display of the leading-edge that allows press or, even, tip the leading-edge so that "rodeen" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have a very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
Even remember them manufacturers of mattresses that, in the "male," began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
Also remember women, for which put a softer area around caderas.
For the most demanding customers, there are somieres structure in Cruz or tablets with the so-called buffer multitorsión.
The pressure was distributed among different points and waives the tension.
It must also bear in mind that, although using the mattress and somier adequate, if you use a pillow (large and "mullida"), will the majority of the benefits.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must underlie the head and the corner can only reach the shoulders, so that they can relax the muscles of the same.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 X 60 cm, something normal, for example in Scandinavia.
The lying down overnight, must be at the same level (when combined with the somier with reinforcement to shoulders or the softer area of mattress) that the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original cushions pies of straw.
The manufacturers are using increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, they are fashionable the organic mattresses.
The raw oil, builds the polyurethane foam, be completed with natural oils, for example of ricino or soya.
Indeed, virtually all manufacturers known used soya.
"biological, in the case of the mattresses, means that the Centre is produced only natural materials," explains Petr vašíček enterprise tropico plus.
Furthermore, natural substances are used in the manufacture of the merging of the mattresses, one of the first aloe Vera.
But it also can opt for the microcápsulas, who released a fresh scent to forest or lavanda.
There are also differences for men and women.
While the men was "cool" with plant extracts of breeze, so that the merging of the mattress will absorb the heat and I could just refresh the body, women prefer "heat" founded.
The extract of red light enhances the circulation of blood, so that women feel more warmth.
Does the favorites?
The mattresses made of foam, which are more porous, with a suitable cell structure, which means that they are more open than the normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold and viscoelástica may manufacture foam mattresses in various areas which they know perfectly well where is head, shoulders and the heels.
A buffer of good quality will cost of seven thousand kronor to the top.
Those who play a role, therapeutic tend to have a lower VAT, because they are considered as health resources.
The first thing that got this advantage in the Czech Republic was gumotex.
It is difficult to save in the mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes it can approve the offers by manufacturers or sellers, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the brand offering magniflex mattresses duofreeze with a memory foam memory affixed to the founded by 11.990 crowns.
The second you get for free.
The era of the viscoelástica with an open cell structure and a high density began with the "cosmic tempur material."
Initially emerged as material for NASA, because during take-offs praises astronauts were subjected to a huge burden.
Ablanda tempur is up with the heat and with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect and best suited their pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid wounds, but also to improve comfort for the dream.
The foam viscoelástica not only used in mattresses, but also for medicinal products, for example to almohadas that is injected under the legs and the ease, as well as their movement.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use the foam eucatherm C or twinsaver and similar.
More and more parents used monitoring devices in people to control their children
The fear for the children has been more and more people to control them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for the monitoring of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl anička janatková.
By the time the device is the size of a box of cerillas, but soon will be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people gave fear the case of the missing anička and started to report on the means available to best protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading their privacy.
"We are all trying to tell us that it is not about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy," the company believes Petr pilin macro Weil, one of the suppliers of monitoring devices in the Czech market.
"I recognise that, in some cases, these devices can be used, for example if they get into the bag of someone without their knowledge, but we are not yet encountered such cases."
"The majority of customers what they buy for security reasons," adds pilin.
In your opinion, children should always know what it is for the "cajita" and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana bočková warns about the fact that, if the child does not want to drive it, just throw away.
"even the smallest children show great creativity to intentionally lose certain things if they want to avoid being monitored."
"before, parents relied greatly on mobiles, but these could be put out as easily as the monitoring device," says bočková.
In its opinion, it is questionable whether such a measure in case of attack is really useful.
"If this is a kidnapping prepared, the author almost always see if the child has, for some kind of electronic device that can disclose his location."
"Now is the telephone."
"according to be extending the use of tracking devices, too, since its sale will undoubtedly take place with too much publicity."
"in such cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
However, adds that such devices can help in the case of an attack improvised a paedophile.
According to Robert čech enterprise RC monitoring, which provides services of monitoring, both for vehicles to people, even if, after an attack, destroy immediately the tracking device, his presence could help.
"You can make the device to send regular position after a certain period."
"If it is damaged, at least it provides the latest position of the person in question."
"The more expensive devices have included an medidor pitch, so if the person is simply resbala and falls, the device will issue an immediate warning with the position in question," says čech.
In his opinion, a service of this kind can be obtained with the smart mobile phone navigation, in which only has to set up a special software.
The problem of the current monitoring units is that by the time it is devices with a similar size to a box of cerillas or mobile phones.
Therefore, could be lost.
According to pilin of macro Weil, for that reason we are testing now with devices that resemble a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage of a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"or that identify it after a while, which may make the police win time," it adds.
Although the monitoring devices are put in the doll or by hanging, still using the same technology used in the monitoring of vehicles.
This is the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the role of a mobile phone that said the current position.
The army has enough to encircle mechas Czech Republic as a whole but only last for two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of fuse for setting explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to his arsenal 224 miles of fuse.
Therefore, they have stocks to 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the fuse is two years, four at most.
The army bought the fuse for explosives at stv group, A. S. by 40 billion crowns.
The staff of general responded to MFF dnes justifying the purchase of such a large amount of fuse saying that soldiers need training exercises for the 60 miles of fuse per year.
According to the calculations of the fireworks of the army, with which contacted MFF dnes, is however that, in this case, they should make these manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives each year also all the generals, officers of high command, and even secretaries and limpiadoras.
They did not want to exempt nor defense minister Alexandr vondr and captain of the army Vlastimil picek.
The only way they could justify the army spent 60 kilometres of fuse.
Such length is tantamount to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient supplies for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts, to the training of every new professional comes with a maximum of two metres of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of units of engineers or special) stocks to the 225 indicated previously.
Soldiers from the brigade for rapid intervention personally recently complained to the Minister Vondra because they say that with little ammunition for various weapons, so it is even firing practices as a matter of money.
And let us not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also understand that we buy repeatedly such quantities of fuse."
"but it is his decision and, without doubt, remember why acting as well."
"for us, the army is a good customer who, as a company, we are trying to meet," admits the stv group commercial director, Jan děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of fuse saying also that will take stock of this "ammunition" to ten years.
However, Jan děcký, stv group, indicates that the fuse only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of the fireworks for the army or the police, for two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, can take up to four," says one of the soldiers who, by the criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
Following the completion of its useful life, each ammunition must be tested to see if is still reliable and not detrimental to the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument is that Ministry, to buy 445 kilometres of fuse, got a discount.
"cost us a 60% less than the requested last year of 244 miles," the spokesman pejšek shopping centre of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of fuse the fireworks of the police, to remove the ammunition from the second world war or the left by the Soviet army, not more for some years the 1500 metres.
In addition, the police always calls for just the right amount to stymie ammunition before it finishes its useful life.
It was decided for reasons of security for the fireworks and, moreover, meanwhile are types of fuse more modern and reliable.
The Department already has clear difficulties in closing tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of 200 000 people were preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the fireworks with which spoke MFF dnes, after a couple of years there will be another problem with the present: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometres of fuse old, which is now buying "cheap."
Until now I am experiencing the contacts that I managed to tender
The fact of winning the competition "entrepreneur of the year" helped Lukáš pytloun in the sale of the franchises of their hotel.
The last edition, won the competition "entrepreneur of the year," the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš pytloun Liberec.
His history of success seems out of a movie.
To Lukáš pytloun Le encantaba travel.
Abroad he realised that in Liberec was required quality accommodation at a price.
With the savings that met with seasonal work abroad and a loan from the Bank bought a House that was half derruida composed of five floors.
Bearing in mind that still looked at his third year at university, it was really brave.
"Today, the cost-effectiveness of housing in our area led me to do something about it," says Lukáš pytloun.
He started to rent the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income they earned the invested back in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, managed to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of housing.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the hotel pytloun design of four stars.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in ostrov or tisé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a franchise of pytloun," said the businessman number one last year.
"The sale of licences for the opening of hotels helped the fact win the support of the 'entrepreneur of the year'," adds grateful pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity as much in Liberec in the vicinity.
"The people I recognized on the street, I still felicitaban often and, I must say, that was very pleasant," recalls.
Without doubt, recommends that everyone who wants to try to any company that is participating in the tender.
But believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is beneficial.
He says that, so far, still lives in the contacts and known that, without the competition, perhaps had not obtained.
"with some people that I met thanks to the support I have begun to cooperate."
The fame associated with success, in his view, also included in the employees.
In total around 70.
"I have seen that show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that got the general recognition."
"It is not, far from it, my own personal success, but that is the result of the hard work of the team."
"That is my name in the headlines," says today Lukáš modestly pytloun.
I wish my successor calmer year which we had in farmet
The euphoria of victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that farmet is over the worst.
The owner of the company farmet, Karel žďárský, was awarded first prize in the latest edition of the competition for Vodafone "company of the year" last year in the "home Slavic" of Prague.
The jury put their efforts, with those who managed to make a small technical workshop in Česká skalice in a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize had not only encouraged me to me but to all my colleagues and enhanced our confidence in the fight against the competition," said the winner of last year.
The history of the company farmet starts with the desire to do something useful.
That is why, when the State proposed to the father of Karel žďárský to rent a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, has not hesitated too; he resigned from his post at the company that constructed and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of batteries of plastic.
Soon after, began to specialize in presses of vegetable oil.
Eight years later became the largest manufacturer of coin-operated presses in the centre of Europe.
They won a greater presence also among the public does not specialised following success in the competition in the media.
"not only our customers started to regard the brand farmet as significantly better, but also foreign partners began to assess the cooperation with a company that won a greater success in their country," said Karel žďárský.
Last year, perhaps it was not in farmet only a sample of the euphoria of victory.
Was also recognition for the results to trade up to 2008, and, in part, of 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the year harder for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which still had not reached many people, causing businesses to pause its investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, nor do we rid ourselves of this situation."
"The revenue fell by 40%, we had to limit the production and even had some redundancies," explains Karel žďárský.
A viable company must, at times, even unpopular measures.
However, monitor the situation and kept the profits of the company, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where farmet was not cut spending on research and development.
"with the subsidies we have built a centre for research and training, strengthen the presence in the international market and obtained excellent assessments in national exhibitions," says žďárský.
Everything indicates that have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are increasing and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expect to bring a sense of victory, but in an atmosphere more level-headed," said Karel žďárský.
A survey that reveals the rules ridiculous
The survey of absurdity of year form part of the tournament for the fourth time in business.
He has already managed to remove some rules are ridiculous.
The winner unknown of the new edition of the survey absurdity of the year was the obligation of bringing the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision adopted by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration called for an extract of the commercial register, although its officials can be accomplished with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security no longer will an extract of the commercial register when carried out an audit of the impositions of the insured," said the spokesman for čssz Jana buraňová.
The purpose of the survey absurdity of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must respect businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and trying to remove those that are absurd.
For the fourth time this year as part of the tournament " s business publication hospodářské noviny and begins to create fashion between the general public.
While the edition last year with the participation of three thousand voters this year virtually reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have legal obligations, several of which must be respected simply to trade.
"perhaps in number of necessary paperwork for the declaration of taxes we are first world," says Karel havlíček of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules is a stated objective of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation has improved particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, the Czech Republic is in the position 74ª, that is, eight posts worse than last year.
The absurdity of the year contest was first held in 2006 and each year in the same way.
Anyone can suggest any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when it closes the competition.
The proposals might be made to the website www.firmaroku.cz. later, the organiser of the tender chooses to seven candidates for the "antipremio" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Wins the absurdity that receives more votes.
For the survey this year there were more than a hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples sent them both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "final" of the competition was framed, for example, the requirement that the vehicles for the maintenance of roads and motorways pay tolls or that employers with 20 employees, two offices and two spas painted every two years the walls.
The list of the 1970s proposals this year is published in the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place in early November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which tend to take social and political personalities.
This year, for example, attended this act of tender Eva svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic, or Petr kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce in the Republic.
"economic prosperity may not last if the state is continually obstacles to employers, so my aim is to eliminate every year a minimum of 30 paragraphs which currently unnecessarily complicate the trade," announced the Minister of industry and trade, Martin kocourek.
The efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not fall by the wayside.
In 2007, the most annoyed people was the duty of the employer to communicate with an advance of three days in the business office of the area of operation permanent, the intention to go with a post to a show or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new law.
The requirement that ended up in second place in the number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the office of work on the part of its foreign workers the journeys of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is the conquered.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for the physiotherapists have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two básculas of soil.
That is why, this year the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying that he had removed the obligation to have a fridge.

In one case, for example of disabled people, in other of the personal problems and health of employees.

"The individual candidates for this contest are not permitted, because it is a subdivision of the main business of the year contest," explains Karel Goldman of the bison & rose.
The police made arrests at a public auction on the building of the agricultural fund, in Pilsen a fortnight
The police against corruption made several arrests in the building of the agricultural fund in the last few days.
The detectives esposaron to a local businessman in the media sector and the property entrepreneur luboš g.
Apparently, this attempt to manipulate a public auction under way for the restoration of rights so that the ground auctioned it received an interested.
Should pay for it to luboš G. half a million crowns.
"at the moment I can only say that the police search a person for bribery during a public auction and tender," he told právo the head of the Attorney General of zelená antonie Pilsen area, adding that by the time cannot divulge more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police soltó impresario of 46 years.
On the way in which could influence the public auction, given the little official information, so you can only speculate.
The spokesman of the agricultural fund lubomíra černá responded to the questions of právo saying that the police carried out the arrest in the headquarters of Pilsen area, and it was during a public auction.
"This is a client, not one of our workers," said.
According to černá public auction, the so-called 'call for proposals for transfer of land in accordance with the law of the land "and occurs when several interested parties on the ground.
"these people, during the call, offering a value higher than that of his return, which must be transferred before announcing the value of the land."
"in terms of the offers, sets out the order of buyers and, later, the agricultural fund transfers the ground to the person who provides the increased supply," said the spokesperson of the fund.
Luboš G. had information about who was to present the collection and, given that the time is interested person because acquired various rights of restitution, proposed to the people on the ground that do not participate in the auction.
For this favour, was taking a Commission.
This would, at the time of the arrest, I had so much money on it.
Special luboš G. had contacts in Pilsen a fortnight since long ago.
In the case of the former head of the PF Václav sankot, who was accused by disposing of the replacement of areas to which it had already issued a decision of construction.
For example, luboš G. just to get the fund some areas earmarked for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where they should build a major road in the industrial area of borská pole.
Later, the changed very beneficial to the magistrate for a House in the historic centre of the city with a much higher.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the areas blocked would avoid building.
The families have to pay additional expenditure of several hundreds of Crowns per month
The homes will have to pay since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity for heating, supplements and, in some cases, rents higher.
Therefore, the families will have to pull out of the bag, starting in January, several hundred Crowns per month more than now.
The price of electricity increases at a 4.6%, gas around 2% in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many are increasing the price of district heating.
The rise of the electricity for the families living in apartments should be up to 100 Crowns per year now.
However, the main suppliers of electricity reduced prices, because it has growing support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular the photovoltaics.
However, the gas is urged moderation, especially at a time when more is used, heating, and hence greater consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred Crowns per year.
While electricity and gas is getting expensive across the country, the price of district heating varies from place to place.
The price rise the plan primarily the largest municipality.
For instance, the homes of Pardubice or of Hradec Králové will pay since January to the central heating around 50 kronor per month, while families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear an increase of 9% of the price of water and heating, especially in the event that the city will increase the rental of the infrastructure.
If the lease does not vary, the praguenses will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest rates, both will become more expensive 7.4%.
Can significantly increase the prices of hiring 450 apartments renting in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company, which has in byty ICC said nad Labem around 2,500 flats, will increase the rent from January in up to 100%.
The company will bring to justice those who are not in accordance with the new lease.
The rent regulated, which benefit the residents of around 300 flats, could increase next year, up 10%.
The young Czechs emborrachan with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because it slowly effect
Fernet, rum, vodka and even whiskeys good stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks which end up in medical care young drinkers aged less than 15 years.
The children who end up lying on the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover because they are not an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who have such cases in the hospital admissions of paediatrics.
"drinking beer or wine of fashion, because they are very slow in emborracharles."
"now the fashion are alcoholic beverages to právo strong," says the head of the hořovice paediatric hospital in the centre of Bohemia, luděk Pelikán.
"when they can hold it a bottle to his father in the alacena, can be whisky, but usually it is Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it lessens with juice and that does not smell so much," explains.
It also confirms the university hospital spokesman motol, Eva jurinová.
"normally, it is usually Fernet or rum."
"These are the modern alcoholic drinks, especially among schoolchildren."
"in some cases, use spirit that pick up at home," adds jurinová.
According to the head Pelikán, drinkers are 13 and 14 years which usually occur in hospitals.
Before hořovice, where working from this year, worked for a decade in paediatrics at motol, where ambulances took young people from the nearby areas.
"A girl had to join perhaps four times."
"began at 12, when the cascades with 3.5 of alcohol in their blood, as well as a mixture of Ecstasy," says the doctor of the Department on this case.
"It was at the festival of Holešovice in some celebration of dance."
"What is interesting is that his mother and was surprised that his daughter be 48 hours," was surprised at the head.
It is precisely the lack of interest from parents or even its clear tolerance towards drink by their children, which is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts say that, in the case of children, you cannot speak proper of dependence.
"We understand by alcohol to a person who has a chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all the phenomena linked to it, which is not produced in children."
"in those who drink alcohol, it must be a social environment or family failed systematically," explains the head Pelikán.
According to the spokesman jurinová, this year in the motol pediatric clinic is hospitalizaron until mid-November 40 children drunk.
However, the figures only show those that come with a serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
The young drinkers who, after the medical check, they will be travelling home with parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children just meet after school and drink firewater, to Pelikán three seasonal ups and downs that it is worth noting: the day of Bruges, end of the year and the end of the school year.
"in such circumstances, drink for the poor or, on the contrary, are celebrating the start of the holiday."
"on the day of the witches, I have come to see in admissions until seven children drunk at the time," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who spend the night in recovery under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day it suffered a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, avoid injecting a serum with glucose and with nutrients, which lacks the body.
"They have been much better, because after the troubled night, get well and not hurts anything."
"only are confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that, often, patients lose good humour at least when they see the costs that have generated.
The transfer in ambulance and the hospital in a room to patients to serious is ten thousand kroner.
"I have often used the cost as a means of teaching them, when in the visit I say directly to children how much it has cost them and that they would have to spend the whole summer jobs for young people to ganaras enough to pay that night," adds Pelikán.
Medical insurance, in its opinion as perhaps measure regressive, which tends to give the people the costs of treatment, not in the case of children who drink.
Two l-159 jets are for the first time in hands alien in Spain
Two l-159 jets out of a total of five, for which the Czech Defence Ministry replaced the plane home c-295m, started on Tuesday to Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer home - EADS.
It is the first time that a system of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the moment, only were abroad for flights of practices or demonstration.
This is the l-159t1 biplaza version, which used the Czech army and was still in a state of flying.
The three remaining planes are the monoplaza l-159.
These are still being kept in Aer vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company omnipol, already took on them last week.
Jan peješk, of the Department of Defense press, suggests that is not yet known when the planes will be physically of vodochody.
"The aircraft monoplaza l-159, however, were separated from the aircraft made a long time ago, without investment or additional contributions by the ministry."
"The biplaza l-159t1 exchange in its current state," he told právo pejšek.
He added that the army is not left without biplaza aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer vodochody totalling 200 billion crowns for the construction of four devices to biplazas l-159 unnecessary.
One of the new aircraft already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to pejšek, EADS vowed that the planes will be added to the equipment in some allied countries.
"in the contract is clearly indicates that the company EADS is withdrawing the l-159 jets and will work to the practice of pilots from NATO countries."
"therefore, depends on the buyer will decide how to use them in this framework," says pejšek.
The hospodářské noviny newspaper published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the l-159.
The exchange of five l-159 by a plane home and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the sale and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of defence claims that the exchange promotes future export l-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired to Aer 72 aircraft and only used 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft home may come to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already complained to the Czech Defence Ministry to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft making a European tendering and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three flights home and the latter should reach the airport praguense of kbely in 14 days.
A finger away longer than the index indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the rate than that cancel are subject to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a studied published Wednesday in the British journal of cancer.
Could depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results suggest that length on the finger can be a test of the risk of prostate cancer, in particular for men aged up to 60 years," said the co-author of the study teacher Ros eeles, of the Institute for cancer research at the University of WARWICK.
Therefore, the finger might help determine why men should be subject to a test for prostate cancer, particularly if this is linked to a genetic risk or other factors, such as family health problems, according to indicates eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, did the follow-up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the finger concerning the right hand more than the void.
They were the same chances of prostate cancer that 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer than the finger cancel, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men age 60% reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of two specific fingers in question, in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones which the foetus in the womb.
A lower level of testosterone corresponds with a longer.
Previous studies suggested the testosterone affects the development of the prostate cancer.
The great genetista Czech, and former President of the Academy of Science, Professor Václav pačes, told Czech Press Agency knows the study, but he does not believe that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can "prove completely."
The Czech Republic under Snow: are closed the D1 and D5
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, amaneció Thursday covered in snow.
The roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by Snow compact and machines quitanieve circulated throughout the night for many areas.
By the morning D5 road was closed between the kilometres 89 and 93 in the direction of rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars, like the D1 in Brno to Prague.
The news sent the operator of the ústředního automotoklubu (úamk).

The means of transport is the subway.
The trams are circulating late, for example in the line between karlovo náměstí and náměstí míru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems affect the railways and the airport.

The special ammunition calibre of 25 mm created for this rifle and the high burden of explosives which contains causes that actually works as a small Granada.
The bullets can be set to explode not only when golpeen objective, but in any point which is in his record balística.
You can use against the opponents that lie behind a barrier, a wall or a cold.
Certainly, we cannot use a normal protection and, when it launches its rain murderous metal chips, may prove to be essential in the battle.
According to Richard audette, who spoke on the development of the xm-25, the new gun is the first weapon for infantry technology that uses a "smart."
"The soldiers the manipulated so that the objective, point to the same its laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a sights precise and, on the basis of the same, corrects the line of projection and pulls the trigger."
"say measured 543 metres."
"when it hits the trigger, the gun charge and been launched the missile to a distance of 543 metres, one, two or three metres," audette says.
Move 400 jobs
The consortium Fujitsu raises its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees will work in his former office building in the marienbader platz in bad homburg the star park.
The Japanese firm Fujitsu raises its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
As was the giant of the sector specialising in computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of next year in his former office building in marienbader platz in bad homburg the star park, a vast complex of offices in the street lyoner straße in the district of niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term other 100 employees more of the consortium, which previously were scattered around the region, alojarán there.
The offer is highly attractive, then the office star park, collective benefit the working methods of employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only occupant in bad homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner said, "in franfkurt-niederrad have found a central site with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday brought joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of Department of Finance in Frankfurt, Markus frank (CDU) said that it has won a "global player."
This is a "wonderful recognition at the site."
Fujitsu is based in the city, the settlement is a major boost for niederrad.
The mayor of hombruger bod, Michael korwisi (the Greens) it regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management reported earlier in the city on their intention.
"Of course we have offered our assistance to the company," stated korwisi.
However, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the owner of the property in marienbader platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons producieron the fall.
So, now there is a great place to cover the famous.
"I hope that the owner of the building and the arrendador be cooperative."
The property was previously used by Fujitsu in the rathausplatz and neighbouring "kleine vertikale" formed with food marienbader buildings platz from ten years ago of a controversial project to build the resort city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the city is a new entry to the city, which is in charge of the critical mass in the building that previously used the gaps as parking and in terms of buildings.
In 2001 have been installed the Department of investment and business valuation, the producer of software for Amadeus, start reservations systems, as well as then joined Siemens with the home computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, a building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group in Frankfurt, Deutsche immobilien-chancen-gruppe along with Morgan Stanley real estate and a year later resold to Spanish falcon real estate investments SA in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, a native of Tokyo, is recognised as the third largest global provider of it.
Have companies, for example of computers and servers, and also provides the services needed.
The branch in rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, anyway, Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu technology solutions is installed from bad homburg in frankfurt-niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu services and a company with the name of TDs.
That is why we have rented 7,000 square metres in the office building of star park.
The complex in the 1920s, its name refers to its place in the form of star among others, is home to the central partnership for Electrotechnical and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels the servant - threats against Assange
The anxiety overcomes increasingly of WikiLeaks.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the platform of revelations of his name.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of diplomatic documents secret.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, apparently, is arrested in England.
The platform of WikiLeaks' is always the butt of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and is currently seeking a homeland of the Internet in Europe.
The well-known American Senator Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and businesses to boycott of WikiLeaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, which is on the list of people wanted by Interpol, must be detained in Britain, according to an article.
"WikiLeaks driven out of the servant of Amazon."
"to speak freely in the country of freedom," comunicaban activists of the revelations by the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had eliminated the documents on WikiLeaks server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the web services Amazon to be able to cope with high levels of access to documents.
Through Twitter, WikiLeaks explained: 'fine, we will be pledging our dollars to employ people in Europe. "
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his name by WikiLeaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported CNN as a call to the office of Lieberman.
The Presidency of the Council of the Senate for the security of the country had threatened to Amazon with boycott, reported the British "guardian."
"I wanted that Amazon take these measures earlier, before the previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also demanded that the platform is also banned in other countries the use of the name.
"The process illegal, monstrous WikiLeaks insensitive and our national security is at stake and threatens the life in the world," it said in a statement from the independent senator.
"No company responsible, whether American or foreign, should help to WikiLeaks with its service to extend material stolen.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Assange, who is sought in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper the independent ,"" the Australian 39 years is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard is aware of the site.
The Internet has described activist constantly research in Sweden as a plot of their enemy.
The spokesman, kristinn hrafnsson WikiLeaks, he said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why there are fears for the safety of Assange said hrafnsson.
Therefore, still has not disclosed the location of the founder of WikiLeaks.
Obviously hrafnsson reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the responsibility for WikiLeaks' should be tried for treason and must be implemented.
In Canada, said an adviser to the Prime Minister Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in television, Assange should "murdered" and Obama could use a "drone."
Between the White House and Assange grows a long dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of the American President Barack Obama described as "ridiculous and absurd" Assange has called for the resignation of the Secretary of State, if she will be responsible for orchestrating recently to diplomats who involucrasen in espionage.
"I am not entirely sure why we must import the opinion of a type with a website," said Gibbs.
"our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The American Government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of their databases in general.
Russell travers, deputy director of the National Center on terrorism, was appointed commissioned exceptional, announced the White House.
By what travers is responsible for developing "the substantial structural reforms', which are necessary in the light of the leak of WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to inspect the paths and change the information on the government and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that for the safety of dissidents and activists, should jeopardise the publication of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything possible to get in contact with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of glacial
In the "gelato university" in Bologna heladeros prepare in the best times of the year.
The course of three days for future heladeros has the greatest influx and visitors from all over the world.
In reality, of all the ice cream?
The gelatiere and gelataio.
The gelatiere prepares the cream according to all the rules of the art of the Italian ice cream.
The gelataio pulled out with a espátula the cream of the ice cream counter, spread over the barquillo and what sells.
To know this, you do not need to go to anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "gelato university" of the Italian company carpigiani.
The manufacturer has fitted to the University of ice cream with the congeladora in 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of their machines meets the high ideals Italians everywhere.
The course of three days for future heladeros has the greatest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses most days on the ice cream of chocolate and practices in the heladería of the home.
In these times of crisis, some are dreaming of a new career, other risks in the soft ice cream its vague desires.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
To Jacky, professor of this art of California, I love the slow food movement and in the future wants to offer a high quality European product in the land of the ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is an adviser to companies and wants to create something own in a few years in a work aggravating.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a heladería in Cairo.
A man of Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream of their pubs, and a housewife, Julia, is because their children adore Italian ice cream.
The master heladero Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants then the qualities ideals of ice cream is perfect.
It is not convincing, only his good taste, but also his mildly sedosa and his good form.
Luciano has not forgotten their training or cover of cream of the Upper House national and mainly in the south of the country, "the Italian ice cream is simply the best, and so each bauble has something romantic."
The first step to drafting seems facilísimo.
Luciano takes the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and a great batidora stabilisers, that hot all with an electronic programme to 85 degrees and the time it enfría until four degrees.
Then opens the tap of the machine and white basic lotion is pasteurised, the basis for all types of ice cream of milk.
Suddenly, Professor question: are the cream of ice cream can be made only with or without estabalizador natural elements?
How can give free rein to some keen to experience?
Luciano advises that 'minds on the job of the trends of the time.
The talks of ice cream "of not only natural ingredients," it has used stabilisers, mainly a natural product, probably, of frijol guar guar rubber.
Of course it can be made ice cream without stabilizing, only to buy a day, put it in a bag and the customer morderá a resounding ice cream of granite.
Permitting some variations in the mass.
Flavourings are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which are bought in the section of fruit or in the sweets in the supermarket.
Moreover, there are powders and toothpaste.
"all providers will try to foist aromatized ingredients in their products."
"However must undergo once."
Whether with sorbetes of fruit to sugar and baby.
Or even with the cream of ice cream from the basic mass with egg white, which will become a yellow cream and cocoa powder as a basis for all potential pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the heladoras.
Luciano allows them to produce more and four different types of ice cream of vanilla, chocolate and hazelnuts, moca, with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Performing the same experiment with types of ice cream to fruit.
That should know better not necessarily depend on who has more aroma of tofe or more fruit purée.
It is not necessary for the ice cream of hazelnuts to more if it contains nuts, including hazelnuts.
The working group has produced the beloved ice cream of kiwi fruit, using more fruit, less water and less of stabilizing.
First a balanced blend highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The drafting of ice cream is a problem of artimética: used the peach purée with a lot of sugar, we must reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
For the ice cream with lemon needed an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano draws a tool with which sets the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (measurement of vinicultor for oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables provide the account.
Producing ice cream requires not only the implementation, as before.
Not only help the utensil automatic for the preparation of the mass.
There is also a tool, which beats the mixture of ice cream ready and we to temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, the whole automation remains outside the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo is channel itself and colleagues of top-down with fruit purée, as if it were a giant miniprimer without control.
"in all classes," says the teacher Luciano, "is just a matter of time something as well."
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European Food Safety Authority has taken root in the industry which has transgenic crops.
At present this issue as the group of experts, which is considered a testbiotech Institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a theory of the conspiracy but we have not well documented," said Christoph then, director of testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry kuiper, the director of the group of experts from EFSA on genetically modified plants, and other expert from EFSA is employed for years in the ilsi association.
The big companies like Monsanto, nestle or Bayer is purchased.
Kuiper has worked in the standards of testing of EFSA of genetically modified plants, as he puts it in a clear conflict of interests, criticises then.
The provisions of EFSA are in paragraphs on the same terms with documentation of the situation of ilsi and imitate the spelling of the company, which in reality is controlled by the Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that testbiotech criticises a clash of interests.
So, recently, a senior manager of EFSA was without the support and the time of transition to the agrarkonzern Swiss Syngenta, and has changed on your side.
Recently, also mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (mdr) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the inspection of the EU and the industry, which carried out the oficinal general of the environment as well as a far-sighted Member of the EU.
However, EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interests.
It uses all the formal data, also to some of the industry, provided that they are of a high technical quality, are ranked in a report.
Are not required to experts who work in EFSA to have no contact with the industry.
But they must address these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the US.
It is called himself as a neutral forum to experts and science, industry and policy, among others, to the risk assessment for biotechnology without the commissioning of a lobby.
On this subject, independent experts, as then, criticise currently allow transgenic plants without investigating the food for the animals and not checking the influence of the genetically modified plants in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, the genetically modified maize in agriculture," says then.
The current practice is to verify only proteinas isolated, but not the entire transgenic plant, which provides reliable results.
"If we do not seek the risks, how will find?" asks, accuser, then.
Angelina hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientific researches since 1994 the field of genetic engineering and is now working on the technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly, in the US and Europe, influence or discredit scientists critics.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For businesses, the critical studies have not been covered as a general rule.
"The industry controls research of security," maintains hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli gsell has achieved, in total around 400 kilos.
On Monday, was at the station in Stuttgart, with the tuba to the shoulders.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is: in September, and bulldozers began to break down a great piece of the North wing.
The land of Stuttgart will never again be the same: thousands and thousands protested against the S21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As was precintado, the greater part of the wing is hizó rubble.
6, 7, broken into pieces.
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft Rugova, placed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, has 43 years.
It has secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthuses: "a cheap and poor, simple and natural."
As once said, has olido the smoke cigarettes.
Still does not know what he will do with the pieces.
The stones have the time.
Uli gsell also.
The trail of the Stuttgart leads to a forest in TUBINGEN in a previous deposit of ammunition of the French navy, where Manuel rongen erected a stone stein-reich.
The man is 44 years old with stones.
It has bought all the outcome of the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would have, molerían the gravilla or transferred to the dustbin," says in her office, a little wooden house that was once a guard.
He insulted and threatened, explains, when, in September, appeared in the newspapers, that had bought the remains of the North wing to the company of derribos.
The spoke with the enemies of the 21s for several days.
And they explained that it could not do absolutely nothing for the demolition.
And when it did, then it was the most sensible, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of S21 took the mazizo 80 kilos cut, with a price for piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some, as it were, as I remember, but also with the hope of sending it back in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, a burden of 25 trucks.
Roughly half is still in the forest, the rest is sold.
Owner of gardens, gardener paisajista, commissioned projects.
They came from all sides and took what they could be carried in the boot and above.
The stone of Stuttgart the momentum it has become "the wall" or in the division of kräuterbeeten.
"in reality this stone is nothing special," says rongen.
"If it were not for the political component."
Amounts to his SUV, a tour by his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
Studied law, interrupted his studies and later biology, interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And is a lover of the stones.
There to 4,000 tonnes of stone.
Transported their treasures across Germany.
He claims to be the largest trader old stones of the country.
Slowing things down.
In the snow is artistic stones of arenisca bitten.
"pertencieron at bridge of Dresden marienbrücke," explains.
Chalk Alba, yellow, warm, enthusiastic about.
"My dear stone."
The path crosses the forest.
Says a lot: arenisca red, a piece of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"beautiful travertino."
In the past, mazizos belonged to the gallery of the neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, travertino yellow of the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite church Sankt blasien, the toba Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When rongen thinks as before the carved stones and led it with a simple gear and a cart, feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something were to be destroyed."
There has been no rich, immensely rich.
But now 14 people wrote to the trader stones, in addition canteros, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a vidriero and a gardener has been set up in the forest.
"We are working hard, but is satisfactory," says the man who is in charge of the remains.
In a little has to go to Cologne.
There is also stones to rescue.
Fight of talent around large potential
Queen active influx in the buffet.
16 students amassed around the panecillos, the tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of braunschweig and the manufacturer vokswagen have been invited to a workshop to students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the workers of VW and learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizando and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, sitting in a fight body to body around the best minds in cooperation with universities.
Their mission: take as soon as possible to the pupils with more talent from universities, before entering the labour market and are employed by others.
And as universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, is trying to see the exceptional talents in practical projects and captarlos.
The second day of project at the technical University of braunscheig, the consortium wins talents.
A miss of the Department of personnel and carpetas gomitas pens, shared with the logo of VW.
Explains to the excited young talent programmes and the work to students and shows their paths in the consortium.
Nico important of the Technical University of braunschweig bears the project with VW.
Sees advantages for both sides: "students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW could make the students see more closely to the candidates, interesting and programmes as possible future workers."
Some partnerships, says important, are not rare.
The novel aspect is that students will be required so directly.
"The main point previously was in the technical projects," says important.
The fight for fresh graduates is becoming more severe.
In many sectors, companies cannot choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If they do not have to be announced and, above all, to achieve a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation situation.
According to the German engineers' Association (vdi (in German), in October there were 40,000 jobs vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognósticos of the vdi engineers, this gap will grow even more.
In the company of auditing and advisory KPMG, Roman dykta is in charge of the hunt for talent.
Organises expensive recruitment events, as the race yincana KPMG, a kind of modern, in which the participants have to find their way through the coordinated the GPS.
The company shipped to eight students very promising to us the following year.
In addition, the participants can observe the subsidiaries of KPMG and learn about the company.
It decides who should go in two rounds of choice in the exit.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants is to us.
Universities are working increasingly in selecting and soften the high potential of universities, according to dykta.
"with the race we want to highlight the money."
"The trip simple alone we fell short."
For the cazatalentos dykta notes yield results.
"until now we have a similar action in the last year, with all participants."
"Some are close to an end, and they want to apply for work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, are also in the hunt, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, with its traditional job fairs.
"We are trying to get students in specialist exhibitions."
"something about," says sitha intersolar stübe, in charge of personnel for the manufacturer of solar technology solarworld.
The company Bonner has about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently on the web page of the company appear 35 vacant posts.
"It is very difficult to fill the vacant jobs."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A way shorter is contact with the teachers at the university.
Solarworld is collaborating with several colleges, for example, the University of freiberg.
"teachers are such that they can practice with us or do his ideas.
There are expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: friendly staff, hierarchy simple and convenient communication.
"a large group usually cannot provide it," says stübe, responsible for staff.
In the search for a job, the money is not the most important.
The key factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good opportunities for advancement.
According to a study of the great place to work instituts, solarworld holds the square 55 among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute produces an annual list of the best suppliers of German jobs.
For what question the employee how pleased we are with work and with the environment in the same and observes the preconditions for employees.
Stübe, responsible for staff also expected extra points in his rating for their candidates to work.
"I think that the applicant is fixed, especially in external ratings to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner kriegler of the akademie deutschen employer branding advising companies that want to a long-term strategy to earn a reputation as employers.
Advising its customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to be as attractive employer to the employees," says.
In the jargon of the field is called employer branding, promotion of internal corporate identity within the workforce.
"some employees happy are the best ambassadors."
When it comes to the people and I identified with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with gang," said kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the US State of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, has not appeared in these years no new oil drilling.
The government in Washington issued a strong prohibition and thereby overturning their previous plans so sound.
Also in the Atlantic coast have been closed by the time new drilling.
It announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in force at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident that claimed the lives of 11 workers and provoked the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the west of the Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and of the industry.
Supporters wanted as well to reduce the dependence of America of new supplies of oil from abroad.
Until now, has not been clarified as yet of who is the responsibility of the irreparable oil spill in the Gulf.
In the center of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A Commission of Inquiry by Obama will present their results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Interior Minister, lifted the moratorium on drilling following the explosion.
Then, various consortia peteroleros submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster using controls tougher and more stringent safety regulations.
Currently the competent supervisory authorities, who had been accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, root and branch reform.
Obama announced parallel that tax loopholes will be closed for the profitable oil and gas companies.
The industry announced publicly that the total production in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
"the plans of the government are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the outcome of the current poll carried out by the consultant bdo - before the ban on mining on Wednesday.
American energey Alliance complains the insecurity in the sector: "nobody knows what changes to the regulation."
Investments in new mining projects goes on for now, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water from the rivers is márrón oil, smell as a petrol pump: millions of litres of oil have shattered the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live in the theft, corruption and the illegal trade of oil.
To akpobari celestine looks well.
"Don canséis" environmental activist, reassuring to journalists: "today will go down enough oil before your eyes."
The Nigerian has managed to take pictures of 37 years vadeando boys in water up to their chests with the glare of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: with the colorful glare of water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is that Brown stains floats on the surface.
Here before caught prawns in handfuls, explains Esther badom in the side of the river bodo-jetty.
Meanwhile, the waters fluid are completely dead.
Five years ago in the formidable wetland leaked into an incredible amount of oil for a broken pipe.
The fish from the outskirts of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters, full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and based in Ogoniland, is seen as one of the most apestadas regions in the world.
In the way of the route of the river that runs through mangrove, the widespread devastation is obvious.
Instead of water, the engine of the boat removes a soup Brown, who submerges his hand in the water, will take a full of oil.
The raices of mangrove trees of the rise from the soil as obscure regaliz sticks, sadly aislan the palm trees that conflict and posted their Palmas.
In vain he sought flocks of birds, as if they were in the watershed as always: as silent the barrier outside, expands in it a sort of calm ghost of a previous haven smell of petrol station.
"What happens here is a struggle," says green, huraño, celestine akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni is a close battle for years: stormed here for over 60 years the first European explorers, here we organised the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed here had to put up its first factory the consortium Shell in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of the oil.
Still it is nowadays forbidden to the return of businesses in Ogoniland: while pumped every day more than two million barrels of black gold across the delta region, a size three times bigger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipes, the oil fields in Ogoniland were reassured, the location is too unstable to the consortium.
Every 200 metres sobresalían platforms of steel as cranky sculptures of the water: "Christmas arbolitos affectionately called" to the heads of the drilling.
They are up to 50 years, the majority have a total corrosion.
A second failure cabezal, believes akpobari, then there is a constant pinch of oil in the water.
According to the assessments of the experts, have been more than two billion litres in 50 years in the Delta ecosystem: year after year, the amount of oil, as in the averia penetrates the vessel "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the largest ecólogicas disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the lasting environmental region, lidiará with it.
While the consortium of shell oil and organised theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see warheads into low-enriched about to be broken and the pipes with losses as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly poor standards of safety in the world for conventional, the scientist Richard Steiner consortium in 2008: only the defects of the pipes are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In a place, which from a distance it seems forgotten, appears a garage full of oil under the open sky, arise between the mangrove figures: are naked and covered in oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which sometimes are united to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flamea a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is hot in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
Firstly, the petrol penetrates through the pipes in the shaft, later the leaking oil pipeline and finalemente diesel leaves.
In this way, Michael and four employees produced on a daily basis up to four barrels of diesel 300 litres: "contains 34 naira," around $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta are fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states of sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only with a single refineria.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel only 40 per euros-céntimo illegal heaters can offer even less, and reduce the value of its raw materials.
"the origin of the bunkers," which trucaron the network of pipes in Ogoniland, according to experts, this step will lose at least 16 million litres of oil a day in the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the interim raw material stored it refines clearly illegally: organised criminal networks, which also include politicians and senior military officials, are the best part in aljibes cheap and sell it on the world market.
The activist akpobari considered purely academic debate over whether the environmental disaster should be quite the handling of the population or the weak way of production.
"If oil companies are not behaving as invaders and had not been destroyed completely natural habitat for fish, would not have sabotage or theft or illegal refinerias."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered especially by Shell to the point that only appears a deduction of consortium: "Perhaps it is better to have other nationalities such as China."
Michael is getting nervous.

The researchers detected dangerous factory flaws in the engines of the A380
Apparently, the A380 is a major safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible original defect that can cause a "catastrophic failure" in the engine.
The airline qantas wants to sue the manufacturer of the engine.
The passengers on the qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing at the beginning of November, had much more luck than you can imagine: the Australian air safety authorities perceived thanks to their research a major security problem in the engines of some A380, and warn of a possible defect of factory.
The potential defect has repercussions complicated: in a connection can cause manguitos, sealed by fatigue or cracks, announced the authorities of the atsb in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines made by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft from the series A380.
Including the qantas-airbus who had to make a hard landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline started legal measures against the British manufacturer of turbines.
Filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney with more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, the director of qantas, declared that his airline will demand compensation for the incident in early November.
In the mark of the engine lost pieces and his ward is deteriorating.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the kind of petrol as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be reinstated.
The Australian researchers announced that they more evidence of the safety of superjumbos fitted with engines affected.
The recommendation of security is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin dolan, a spokesman for atsb.
The problem of security has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the apparatus of qantas, the airline kept its fleet A380 on earth for many weeks.
Singapore airlines had approximately three of its 11 A380 temporarily in land.
Lufthansa reinstated the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This plane with dual deck is the largest passenger plane in the world.

In addition, strong gusts of wind take a broad brush to the Baltic Sea coast.
The federal agency maritime and hydrographic of Germany (bsh) expected tides alive on the level of water 1.2 metres above their usual level in the Baltic Sea coast schleswig-holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the weather service meteomedia, is called the red alert in sächsischen Matterhorn, the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimetres of snow newly fall and cold winds and heavy arremolinarla section.
There were trapped during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony anhalt police authorities notified important rioting in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralyzed and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snowfall hit the A4 and the A9.
According to deutscher Bahn, expected major disruption in Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia anhalt, in northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the lanes or the catenaria shattered and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the Leipzig commuter service.
In saafeld, Thuringia a train INCE had to stop their trip to Munich.
The fire and rescue service assisted the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.

Deusche bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: according to an article, the financial institution looking for a buyer for its office towers in its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Recently deutschen bank managed his seat: were modernised the twin towers in the area of banks in Frankfurt; while the bankers are back to their former place of work.
But now the consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the reonvación, and is seeking a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as stated in the Financial Times Deutschland "based on a spokesman.
The spokesman did not mention the reasons for sale in the project.
"Whenever we see whether owning property or sell it and then return to alquilarlas," he said.
That is why the greatest credit institution of Germany is to give up the seat of their company after a short period of time.
The Bank acquired the twin towers in the middle of 2007 by 272 million euros the investor in a fund of the home and then made the necessary arrangements.
Energy reform reached figures of approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the Bank.

If you sell the buildings renewed in a fund of a bank or an independent investor has not been revealed, said the spokesman.
Thousands of mourning for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought in the miners buried, started by dead after many explosions in a mine.
Office have not been able to find the bodies, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
For nearly two weeks ago there was a huge explosion in a mine Pike River near the town of greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
It introduced a probe in the place of the misery, but found no sign of survival.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, any rescue team could fall for security reasons.
After the second massive bang, authorities and experts led that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
No bodies have been recovered so far.
Currently the relatives and friends of the dead with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glare of the sun shining in greymouth in the South Island of New Zealand.
Silent for two minutes.
In tribute to the miners buried, laid 29 tables with helmets and lights and names of the miners.
Also had photographs and personal belongings, under clothes and tables of surfing.
Flags flew at half-mast on government buildings in the country.
New Zealand waited to return the miners to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John key, the President of the New Zealand government, the participants of the commemoration.
"but never returned home."
Cannot take over the death of their son until he has not seen his body, said lawrie drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Together with the President of the government and the families of the victims took part in the commemoration many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion on 19 November were also buried miners of UK origin and South Africa.
Rescue workers exhausted started a fire in the interior of the coal mine in the South Island of New Zealand.
As for explosive gases have been drawn, temperatures abrasadoras within the mine will start to decline, said Gary knowles, the senior police, journalists.
Woe to the devil, warrior!
Will the Gore fits the artistic film?
The director Nicolas winding refn is to explore the boundaries of the genre with his saga of battles "walhalla rising."
What public thinking the Danish director Nicolas winding refn running "walhalla rising"?
A warrior vikingo prisoner with one eye (Mads mikkelsen) is released from their torturers and kills their enemies with almost sobrehumanas, sounds ideal for young viewers that bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and drive their enemies, the bite of their bodies with life when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, unojo, it is not, in fact, almost no word throughout the film and the other characters they are driven by as much one or two sentences, or a couple of painful cries.
Otherwise silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying montuosos landscapes of Scotland, that the scenes are offering the world vikingo of around a thousand years.
Rather, ideal for film-makers swollen and interested in the existencialismo and movements of House very calmados.
When a film has several target groups it is a pity that cannot be ruled out.
The director winding refn considers its wild and to the trilogy about hair drug dealer "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses to live to make their works to the general public with something more humour into the mainstream or something less brutality of the art House.
A brain mass and gut sprouting cannot deter the majority of the supporters of cinema circles.
The majority of the fans of the action was dying of boredom, if unojo take a boat to Jerusalem with a violent cristioneros missionaries for reasons interpretable and is confining an eternity in the calm and fog before his team come to America and back to shut up there.
It is a pity that "rising" walhalla film distributor has not found in Germany and only be published on DVDs.
It is a calamity against the fantastic images, but also because, after the presuntuosa and bloody façade is a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, it deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, all is atmosphere, a fevered dream transformed into film.
And that is why there is no excuse for viewers.
Condede refn is scarcely a moment of relaxation and their images glaciers and the grim noise band of trauma make him a noose around his neck, above all, the incredible hatred, that since the hearts of the characters is going towards him.
Only a small girl hair, which supports unojo faithfully retains something as innocence, everyone else is owned by the IRA.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never, at any time in a warrior out of hell for enemies and allies temporary, possibly in the Ambassador of the devil.
The accounts for the downfall, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
Walhalla "rising" is a film mysterious that we can hate and admire, to get angry, tampered with and wonder.
An experience.
Mysterious movements of Earth
The organisation of nuclear energy IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country is refusing to comment on this subject so that controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September, 2007, at least four Israeli planes F-15 fighter R attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
Lies on the edge of Euphrates; the city closer and closer, 30 kilometres is as-saur dair.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is about an apparently the Syrian reactor built with North Korean assistance in the dustbin, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the US international intelligence service, the CIA to the end of April 2008, is a reactor design flow under the name of the near el-kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium with which to build nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technique only used for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation on video with images of satellite blurred.
With a computer animation showed where were the components of the reactor before the destruction, which was a copy the model of the North Korean Yongbyon nuclear plant.
In addition were shown photographs that showed the building from the vicinity or from inside.
Recently the reactor was in operation, he says, but still was not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later the bombing, is barely known that by that time, the puzzles were wider over time.
The former US President George W. Bush unveiled recently in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-kibar, but that hardly saw evidence of that in the country there were "a nuclear weapons program."
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and just talk about a "course reactor," even consider "plausible" the presentation of the CIA.
They need solid evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have in front of a reactor, a senior UN diplomat responded in summer so concise that the IAEA has "sufficient material to take questions."
The Syrians were very quickly on the rubble of the alleged "remains unused military building" and paved the way.
However, in June 2008, a team of the IAEA under the previous chief inspector Olli heinonen found rastos of uranium in el-kibar, which had been produced by people.
In addition the IAEA obtained satellite images on a Member State, commercial sellers in the moments immediately after the attack, which must have a value higher than the one presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not come to the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity regardless.
Syria always hinted that had never had a secret nuclear programme and built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, explained damaskus.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after the analysis of the particles.
Since then damaskus refuses to discuss them, as regards the satellite images.
Furthermore, the demands are banned from a second inspection in el-kibar and the entrance to the ruins of a building bombed.
Israel keeps a tight silence.
"we never discuss them," Ehud Olmert, the Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation has not produced results since June 2008 and was "gradually transformed into a serious problem of credibility to the authorities," as one Western diplomat in high office corresponds with a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally there is a serious offence against the Treaty of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which oversees the IAEA.
The IAEA believes three teams more as the key to progress in the investigation, that should be "functional" in connection with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not revealed publicly until the moment of what equipment is, or what tasks have, or if seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has appointed and internally to as-sultan, marj masyaf and iskandariayah, again with the surroundings of the cities situated.
The independent Institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near masyaf with satellite images, which will most likely be one of the objects suspects.
Possibly in or next to a military base, Syria prohibits the entry of the three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna, says that the Syrian authorities fear a register that the US has asked the IAEA to spy military plants.
The detectives were warning of nuclear equipment thanks to the warnings of the secret service in the US.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that moves material between the three places and belongs to the Bank of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "connected with the production of fuel."
But there is "no sign of activity," or sensitive uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is Acciona with uranium that is enriched.
Where should come the uranium and where it should be separated later plutonium for bombs, to these central questions is, at best, assumptions plausible.
Nor are there any doubts about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can recover, are at the three locations.
As disappeared hundreds of cargo trucks of soil, no one has information on where to stay the rubble.
The oiae considers it unlikely the al-tibni salt mine, located in the few miles from el-kibar to another part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians acknowledged in 1998 for his skill as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former inspector of the IAEA, drew with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images in the prestigious journal Jane 's intelligence review.
But the photos from the orbit show that the Syrians have made movement of land in the three alleged places suspects and eliminate large containers after the IAEA asked the entry.
It may be a coincidence but hardly helps to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, in the sector diplomat says that the IAEA has spent some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrians would, to keep the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, damaskus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna last year relaxed that the reactor was destroyed, so the issue does not have much urgency, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a kind of Ambassador of the United States - the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous vienesas nuclear authorities to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, which should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option that I am open in the future," but still falters.
This way is very risky: requires a majority of the Council of governance of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager to escalate.
Furthermore, as thought a diplomat: "So what if in the end they do not find anything?"
The love in the time of the War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the direction of their debut are yet to name.
She has written the script, a love story between a Bosnia and Serbia.
You do not know very much about this, but this is enough for the unrest.
The rumor is very persistent, women, Muslim, falls in love with her rapist Serbs during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women 's organisations have protested quickly, so that in the last few days of the initial time were planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been well in Hungary and post-productive, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic of the organisation of women victims of the war he wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not a diplomatic, weeks ago women offered a meeting in Hungary that rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says hasecic.
There are stories of love in the fields of violations, and the position of Jolie about it betrays the victims enough about the script.
The agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismiss Jolie as Ambassador, reports the guardian.
But what, exactly, Jolie has written to the scenes?
The Ministry of Culture Bosniak read the script, awarded after a tug-of-war a permit of recording in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author repeats that it pursues political objectives with his film, introduced with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains unclear.
The network is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: lovers were together before the start of the war and are reflected when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
It sounds considerably different is the "victim of rape falls in love with torturer."
It is certain that the film of Jolie has really begun before the war.
The pressure on it, says Jolie is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Today, it can make peace with the Hollywood hacker: while the script is in the network of illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon at last, be good for the Irish.
No trace of distress
Instead, the home team dominated on their clients of Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans shout of delight as resounding music high on, the floor with their feet.
The club Bailey vibrates in the sudirlandés Cork, because the players are to be launched, and pingpong balls to the glasses of beer from a distance of three metres

Tanner is a quiet, ultimately, this bizarre game of drink and the discreet bugs in reality they do not make good friends.
And the boy of 26 years trying to play with that, the question of recreation spot, what would happen in the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in their plans, in January will make a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a nasty feeling," she says.
"It is very far from home and still have no job."
At least: his girlfriend him in Auckland, "of up to win the job of your dreams as manager of events, it is perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiling.
Because of the poor prospects at home, two of the three brothers of tanners have already sought luck abroad.
His sister, Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin works at present it as an adviser in londrés.
Young people are: on the island, there are many families as the tanners.
100 Irish are leaving the country in the near future, predicting economic experts and the Institute of social research ESRI of Dublin.
Until 2015 are 200 migrants.
A great loss to this small country with only 4.5 million people.
The forecasts are confirmed, is comparable to a migratory wave on the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that trajó a great prosperity to the Irish, now extends melancholy.
The economic crisis confuses especially to the young, Irish well trained, for which up to now, everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and the social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
They all need to have money sloshing around.
But three out of ten men and women under 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish times there are letters to the editor in mass of young people, who complain that: "in Ireland everything collapses."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, will and lose our country and to a whole generation."
"The last thing we close the door."
Leanne caulfield, law student and President of the Union of Irish students see have a bright future because the government only pays to prosecution and already offers no future prospects for young people.

For the year, Seán o 'donovan knows how to build something in another room.
Since it no longer had anything to do for the engineer of 29 years, is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now raise a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January will be Hanover or to Berlin, the next project.
O 'donovan sees its homeland only rarely because working overtime to pay for a credit to his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, because for a long time for the first time I stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I earn money in Germany to a house in Ireland, where ever I am as well."
Laughs somewhat embarrassed and goes for rooms frost.
The tiny house is in an elegant residential area gardens with care to the houses, in the parked cars are big and expensive.
O 'donovan bought the home along with his sister four years ago by 380 000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a loan.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Is there any fear of failure with the credit?
O 'donovan thinks, serves hot tea and says: "I do not have children that have to feed and I am young; if anything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the grievances that constantly telling us today.
"No one should starve, our situation is not, as far as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"work a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with this we are for the first time as Irish."
Laughs and account about his father, who in the last big economic crisis was to England.
"after seven years returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
To ultimately tanner likes these ideas.
Leave pending future and simply do as is life elsewhere.
It worked a couple of years in London and why they are not going to go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that is worried about so much: the celebration of his 27 birthday Friday in Dublin.
Fears that could degenerate into a party of farewell.
"only, not too many emotions," he says and gives a great pill to his beer.
"farewell, sounds very distressing."
"better to call it a celebration of marching, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Rising support for democracy in Latin America, as well as the backing for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Furthermore, in large part of the region, sees Brazil as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest survey of latinobarómetro made in 18 countries and published exclusively by the economist.
Given that the survey has been held regularly since 1995, allows us to monitor the changes in attitudes in the region.
In the results of the survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two issues.
The first is the humour relatively animated in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has risen considerably in the various countries of the Pacific coast of South America (consult the table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen since a fallen 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a huge decline in production last year.
However, only half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which would lower the regional average (consult the chart 2).
Around 44% of those polled in the region declared themselves satisfied with the way in which democracy is working in practice in his country, the same figure as last year, but considerably more than 25% in 2001 (chart 3).
Around 34% said that they trusted Congress of his country and 45% in his government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America have seriously affected the support for democracy.
The fact that it has been held over the global financial crisis probably stems from that many Latin American countries only were affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and that has been reduced again this year, up 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (consult the chart 4).
The good economic returns of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
That sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, most respondents in Latin America about the crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing the country (consult the chart 5).
Around 31% saying that either they or a close relative, has been a victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has dropped from 38% last year and that is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns is reflected in a greater support for private companies and the market economy: approximately 71% of those polled in the region say that private companies are essential for development, while in 2007 as it was only 56% (consult the chart 6).
Approximately 58% agrees that the market economy is the only system that will allow the country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and the 80% supports private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that exerts greater leadership in the region, as indicated in the 19% of respondents (compared with 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the most influential country deemed by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds that title in Ecuador and Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic.
Elections to the rubbish
No one expected that the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, took place in a much worse than what was feared foreigners trying to help the country to pick up after their problems.
With votes in the ballot box, some people voted several times by lying in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the earthquake in January, move for the area trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, they gave up.
A dozen candidates for the presidential elections, including several of the more popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond mulet, the UN official senior in Haiti, declared that the elections were "relatively good in many ways."
The observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, with caution, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, revoke necessarily the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, according to their opponents is committed to René Préval says, the unpopular outgoing President, and with their candidate, jude célestin, should announce preliminary results on 7 December.
Then playing is expected to take place in January.
They have still not lost all hope in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel martelly, a rapero, and mirlande manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in calling for the cancellation of the vote.
But they can still cause problems if the electoral authority states that Mr célestin, that has little or no support, has moved to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the cholera epidemic; the country and more than a million survivors of the earthquake is still living in tents, we expected a big turnout.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but did not do so due to a lack of organisation.
Around 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote still had not been distributed shortly before the election.
There is much at stake.
Aid donors believe that the election of a government and a legitimate is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has become clear, they also think the Haitians themselves.
Moving tiptoeing towards the centre
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its ratings on 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level it has been since his election in 2007.
Despite everything, we can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in elections next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, his predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was taking charge of economic policy even after his wife would happen as President, had the habit of producing budgets that infravaloraban tax revenue, the economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple spend additional revenue at its discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs Fernandez lost their majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following the death of Kirchner because of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Ms Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which a Member gave him a punch in the face and other Members accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the budget by 2011.
"I am not going to discuss," said the President.
The 2010 budget, therefore, apply to next year, which will give the President a margin of still greater in the spending thereof.
The economy is improving considerably: will probably grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at the 11.1%, but many private calculations, as well as the demands of the unions, the wages are around 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made the growth and the reduction of poverty, their priorities, rather than the control of inflation.
Refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and sent the indec, the Institute of statistics, adapt the official statistics of inflation.
How will moderate the President Fernández these policies?
He has called meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
In addition, officials say they want to limit pay increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been fueled by high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Ms Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore the financial ties of Argentina with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused to a forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it appears that Ms Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with creditor governments grouped together in the club of Paris, to approximately $6.7 million.
The Kirchner always insisted that this does not imply the supervision of the IMF, as usual.
However, last month, Amado boudou, the economy minister, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to prepare a new national consumer price index, which appears to be the prelude to cleaning the indec.
It is not clear whether the President Fernández wants to continue in politics when its mandate, bearing in mind that no longer has to husband his hand.
If it does, it will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which is tired of kirchnerismo.
When Argentines return from their summer break in March, the wave of sympathy for her will be dropped.
If you want to win other elections, will have to decide whether or not repudiating, calmly, many of the policies of her husband.
The hurrah China
Voters in Taiwan are coming slowly to a kind of Union closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan on its big brother to the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, went on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors of five urban districts in what appears to be a comprehensive assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma has become an advocate of sentiment on the continent, innovative forging business links, including a free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five elections for mayor, failed to get the most votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been tipped for a full independence for Taiwan, won almost 50% of all the votes compared to 45% for the KMT.
If they had been the presidential elections, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP empató with the KMT municipalities.
In the elections could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy trucks and large crowds with banderitas lighter clothing and girls dancing.
Nor was the mysterious assassination attempt of rigour.
Are LIEN, the son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the candidates of the KMT the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young directly in the eye, hiriéndole and killing a transeúnte.
The curious thing is that it has not been able to determine whether the man was inflicting harm to LIEN or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, said tsai ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the fire overran the elections, scattering suspicions on the DPP and causing the voters inclinasen by the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it were not the subject of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of plans for public housing and employment.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and loathes the military threat from China.
Therefore, the KMT is often avoid publicise its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP avoided encourage the feeling against China.
Responding to the new awareness that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
For his part, Mr Ma said that it had confirmed that its policy towards China was acceptable to the majority of the Taiwanese.
It provides that the Beijing Government to sobornándoles with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China lost no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it would also ensure the political integration, but first things first.
It would be best to wait through the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigaba openly independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs tsai, has emerged a new generation of moderates and the DPP is struggling to attract professionals and young people.
Ms tsai has been welcomed warmly as candidate for the Presidency of the DPP, like his tseng-chang, which fulfilled mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that they can have relations with Beijing.
Ms tsai announced the plans for a group of experts that acts as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided they can carry out the negotiations without preconditions.
Ms tsai says the Taiwanese public that his party is a "reliable alternative" to the hasty approach of Mr Ma with regard to China.
Mr Chen is outraged by the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, said that the candidates of the DPP had better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered Mr its, a pragmatist who submit to the President.
Even without that call Mr Chen, the DPP will have to choose between their potential candidates.
The KMT also has some soul-searching.
The opinion of Mr Ma have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to campaign with him.
His lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and to the growing gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman of the KMT says that restructures his cabinet, as well as local teams.
The bites of the DPP suggest that the support of Taiwan to a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, the majority of the Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "has already been crossed the point of no return."
Grammy nominations to the Jazz singer: the hope Spalding is the election surprise in the category of artist disclosure.
Acting at the request of a President and possibly people are placed in it.
Hope Spalding, the falling and Jazz singer of 26 years chosen personally by President Obama to act in their ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of the grammys this year with a nomination in the category of best artist disclosure.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of the Jazz from their album of 2008, "hope," the nomination is what to think, but respecting the rules of the grammys, according to which must be an artist who has not lifted the market more than three álbumes before recording which determines the identity "public artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber music society," certainly was a great step forward and, bearing in mind its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, Funk and Latino rhythms, it can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the way to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the voters of the grammys, who lately have been concentrated in the field of Jazz for this category.
In the other categories, grammy voters did honor with reason to 'historicity "Vijay iyer, a trio of exciting and wonderful disc that was one of the favorites last year.
Among the competitors is the senior iyer saxofonista James Moody 4b "Moody" and the teclista John Beasley for "positootly."
Trombone shorty, a gaudy favourite in New Orleans and invited in "treme," the HBO, was honoured in the category of contemporary jazz, that for the rest goes considerably towards a merger as in the álbumes Stanley Clarke, John mclaughlin and Jeff lorber.
The savage punk of darcy James argue 's secret society got a well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the great Jazz of House of Willy Childs ensemble and the always risky dave Holland, whose album live with their octeto, "pathways," was a great example of the democratic leadership of falling in his gang.

The mosque proposal in temecula gets the approval of the Commission system
The draft mosque for temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the local organising committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying that encourages terrorism and congestion.
However, the members of the Commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respect local laws and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Baha 'I, of all religions," said Hadi nael, President of the Islamic centre of temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails.
"The opposition is really minimal," it adds.
"just talking very high."
"There are people in this valley wonderful."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who intercedía in favour or against the centre, virtually the same amount in each hand, according to the press-enterprise.
The discussion continued at the Web site of the newspaper.
"the United States is no longer there," says one of the comments.
"This is another planet of the apes with Mrs freedom dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans for construction of Islamic centres have led to protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the area of New York where came the attacks of September 11, 2011.
In the temecula valley, the magnet Mahmoud harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families live without problems for years in the county of riverside, but wanted a bigger and better than the warehouse that renting in a shared ownership with a water filter systems.

Would surface of 4,32 acres in Nicolas road, around two miles to the east of the chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project before the City Council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth or in other places...
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients holds out the possibility of finding new ways of life on earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although the researchers found the strange bacteria here on earth, say that shows it is possible that there are ways of life without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"It can grow is with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"that makes it a very peculiar, although he needed to be a kind of living really 'alien'," said Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, a co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
For some time, it believes that there are six large elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in monkey lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing the phosphorus by arsenic.
"You plantearte what more is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to indicated Anbar, the finding is important in the search for life on different planets of the land, given that researchers need to be able to recognize the life, knowing the aspect which has.
The study focuses on a microbe found in the earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, which is not have spread details of the discovery, led to a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of outer life.
We did not.
What the discovery "Yes shows is that in other areas worldwide, could have bodies to use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that all elements" standard "that we consider essential to the life may not be so fixed," said Charles cockell, professor of planetary and space sciences research institute, the open university in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell not formed part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the replacement of an element for another in biochemistry and structure cockell basic biochemistry," he added.
The discovery was not applied by accident.
The Institute of wolfe-simon Felisa astrobiología of NASA, who led the study, focused on the monkey Lake because it contains high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from the point of view, so that speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one with another.
"arsenic is a toxic chemical mainly because their behaviour is similar to that of phosphorus."
"consequently, may find it difficult to conclusions."
"however, arsenic is sufficiently different to that does not work as well as phosphorus, for what it is and, as it were, apelmaza biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers also collected bacteria known as gfaj-1 and exposed the growing concentrations of arsenic, which managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that you can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may be a natural a way of life to use arsenic, either in other areas of the earth and another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that we can replace the arsenic for phosphorus is not new, but had never been found an example that should prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in earlier eras of the earth, pointed out, the researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used.
"It suggests that there might be other means to create life, not only how life formed on earth used to," said foster, who was not part of the research team of wolfe-simon.
The research was backed by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs have been found missing in compton
The two dogs have been found of the four that were stolen from motel bellflower, according to said officers from the Sheriff of the county of Los Angeles on Thursday.
The four dogs, two akitas and two Welsh corgi pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole past Chevrolet express 2006 where they were going through the night, against the bellflower motel 6, pointed out the authorities.
Two of the caninos recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found on Wednesday, late at night, according to reported Steve whitmore, a spokesman for the Department of the Sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," said whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to indicate exactly where they found the dogs in the neighbourhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"It is carrying out an investigation."
"We do not want to say anything," said whitmore.
"We are following some clues."
It was not possible to find the owners of the dogs, kristina rickard and David Peek, to make some comments on Thursday.
Met with their two akitas in a county animal shelter in downey Wednesday afternoon.
The assistants of the Sheriff found the van and the two dogs separately in compton.
According to the authorities, the akitas (draw, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a perra 10 months) had not suffered damage.
But bunny and Peter, the corgis who rickard and Peek to exhibit in competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and rickard, who live in redding, were in the city for the akc / eukanuba national championship in long beach this weekend and had the intention to showcase to draw.
The other dogs the were to appear in other events planned for the run-up to the championships, according to akc / eukanuba indicated Peek in the times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour for almost two months making the couple involved in caninas competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and rickard did the check-in at the motel.
Usually they are in moteles and park, the van in front of the window of their room.
With three other dogs (rearing Parson Russell terrier, a boxer and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But the akitas and corgis in the van because they have a coat very bulk and would be more fresh.
Left windows slightly open, so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and rickard denounced the theft of the van Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said he would offer a reward to anyone who could escort until the corgis, fitted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear whether it would be a reward or not.
The lion is ready to rugir again, at the time that the restructuring of GMMs gets the final approval of the Court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, GMMs has finally found a green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York formally approved the plan "prearmado" by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the entertainment of 86 years focus their efforts on the production and release of films and television programmes.
The ruling on Thursday confirmed that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, so that there are no other legal obstacles to GMMs revives under the founders of spyglass entertainment and Roger birnbaum, Gary barber, who will become the senior executives of what will be a study reduced.
The staff reduction of approximately 400 to 320 Members.
In reality, GMMs will not come out of Chapter 11 until that JPMorgan chase closing a credit instrument planned 500 million dollars to finance operations and production of new GMMs.
The investment bank is currently sindicando credit, that alone is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed by the middle of December.
The process of restructuring the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank moelis and Co. was contracted to give advice on the management needed to sort out its finances, as they strove to make interest payments by $300 million a year.
In the month of August, the chief executive Harry sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and an expert in recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work in krispy kreme doughnuts.
The attempts of moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial travails of GMMs and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study, required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay more than $2 billion sought by the creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the table when the design team of GMMs began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was eventually backed by creditors at the end of October.
When GMMs officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the companies of moelis and Cooper will receive multi-million bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
The companies of Cooper, who have been collecting 375 000 dollars per month for his services to the company, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and birnbaum, plan to resume production in GMMs, that opening only one movie this year, and annual meeting a slate of seven or eight films coming out in 2012.
Also plan to co-finance two films based on "the hobbit," along with Warner bros.
The study needs to be seeking a loan of between 265 and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl icahn, who owns approximately 18% of the debt of GMMs, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with lions gate entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies were not in agreement.
Tech toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for gifts
While the iPad is the top candidate to be the most wonderful of toys this year, followed by, perhaps, the system of video games, Microsoft kinect, both can make a significant dent in your budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of a can buy five iPad bmx bikes to 99 dollars each, and a game kinect costs the same as 10 strings of traditional leap adornadas with auditors, or roughly 48 cans of play-doh.
But there are ways to keep its budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, toys "R" us and bj 's wholesale club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the law of Moore has been working; the technological toys this year is likely to have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared with last year.
In addition, while generally there are fewer new toys with partner websites, two of the best known of this type, webkinz and club Penguin, are more offers.
And toys powered button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(all prices are for toys "R" us, except that is present in a different way).
The sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are toys soft toys of the size of a cobayo chanting a note when you pull distended.
Shake is tantamount to a note, and a second shake begins to build a song.
If you are buying more of one, they cantarán in harmony.
Caution: once it starts tightening, cannot stop.
For song combined with dance, dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
By borrowing from the technology of elmo live last year, the muñeco animatrónico 14 inches plays games in exchange for turn as simóm says, and can make the step moon, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheels with blocking device.
Children who tested the toy used to Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, may remind alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (hasbro / playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a rucksack full of letters of questions designed to get a ride in a car in a session with a set of exercises ocurrente self-correcting.
If you are unfriendly to give your child a smart phone, here econtrará three independent alternatives.
Mobigo of vtech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheaper and easier to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the Games teach as effectively as the leapster explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), is the first definition of the leapster line, with a screen more new and shiny.
Neither version is compatible with old cartridges.
Ixl of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the kind iTunes for table games and e-books, and has a slots for sd cards that can display photos of family.
Finally, scrabble flash ($30, hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks barely bigger than a box of cerillas, each with its own screen LEDs.
The aim is to arm putting words in blocks lined up before the end of time; it is a competition for impromptu of armed words.
They are increasingly toys that have some sort of connection in line.
Founded only in her presence in jugueterías, the two largest are webkinz and club Penguin.
To buy his son a mascota in line in the club Penguin, for example, can achieve a Disney club Penguin 2 'mix' n match with Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you canjea the code online, your son gets enough funds in the club Penguin shop for two articles.
These could include roller on wheels or a toy mascota puffle.
Slightly larger than the cerda their toothbrushes, hexbug nano ($10, for five years and more) is the latest in a line of microrobots powered button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly about 12 feet of silicon that vibran, in random directions.
It is fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if he can find the exit.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while in the mouths of our dog.
It promotes a more moderate the maintenance of order in China
As a sergeant instructor urban, Tang shenbin marked the step in a square in the city, inspecting severely to the nerve dependants, issuing orders in whispers with military authority.
He wanted the female Members of corpulentos chengguan, the police the order from China, feared and scorned by its strong measures capricious and his penchant for violence, on a certain feeling to a handful of spectators.
"You!"
"attention!"
He muéstrenles, he whispered, "How are the girls fine!"
Four girls who barely passed the teens with white collar and identical olive Green jackets and trousers tailored to draw attention.
Four pairs of shoes were black perfectly aligned.
Four hats genteel fitted perfectly above the hair tied up with moños to white and blue lines.
"personally, I think we have a normal appearance," said Mr Tang, desdeñosamente.
"The models are lindos."
More than a government has tried to clean up the image of the inspectors urban China.
A city ordered that all the new recruits have a title of degree.
Guangdong province changed the appalling Green uniform of the blue to a supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating gaze: in 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward near snacks, and I noted with the few eyebrows steadily for half an hour, until the travelling salesman gathered their things and left.
Xindu, an urban district 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give to the dubious police a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, until scarlett johansson would strive to increase the respect of China for comparison with these squads of the city.
And for good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, the officers are allowed only to enforce regulations of the city, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely depicting a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of Hubei province killed blows to a transeúnte after having used their cell phone for filmarlos while disolvían a protest against a landfill of waste.
Last year, a handbook of training for inspectors in Beijing was guilty, and published on the Internet, which he described as a scourge effectively to criminals, without making them bleed.
This year, a travelling salesman sandías of Shanghai suffered brain damage after a row with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who are attacking street sellers.
"chengguan has left a scar on the government," he complained China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After that the district put it through a warning eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing evening news asked if women had real duties or were simply a distraction escénica.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The notice of district called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years, with a good figure and the five "harmonious" facial features.
They had to take a height above the average, more than 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement at the age of 26 years is compulsory.
Officials said the work was physically too arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"his image is the important point," said one anonymous official district to rednet.com, a Web site near government.
"first, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they comply with the requirements, such as facial features, height, weight, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the home qualities."
The chengguan are as floreros female, he said, adding, "as well as being floreros, will have other responsibilities."
Zheng lihua, deputy director of the office of administration of the city in the district, is not eager to support this description.
But noted that the demands of high standards in many ads were Chinese work for both sexes.
Then there is the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured must not stand.
"We cannot allow a person or a hobbled jorobado come to work here," said Mr Zheng.
"his image would not be right."
Liu Yi, who patrol baoguang square near a monastery, has 22 years, with their cheeks and a mouth just subtly curve.
She does not believe that the accent in his appearance is sexist, he said.
"Do you think I sound sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a look sardónica.
His colleague with hoyuelos, Xu Yang, 21, said, "our work must present the image of the city."
They do not oppose their work on time, they said, because harbour ambitions to race higher than simply scare sellers in the alleys where it is supposed to cover his business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less to a dozen hawkers was on foot or bicycle, trying to sell so many panecillos or ceramic tofú as possible before being themselves.
"Mr Wang, must leave."
"I have said many times!" said Miss Xu while a seller escaped on foot, leaving its cart thrown by bicycle with garrisons of fideos.
The officials described his duties as more monótonos that strenuous.
"This is more or less the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, of 20 years, who is marketing in their hours free.
"very routine."
One reason is that the female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of sellers.
They can only threaten to expose offenders to their supervisors men.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of the tape, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of people in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, amotinaron then that is esparciera the false rumor that a chengguan officers killed a seller.
More than a dozen policemen or chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 vehicles were so committed to the government or prendidos fire.
By the time xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is hardly assured.
Only two streets in the placid baoguang square, where the female officers patrullaron this morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had seized a motorcycle that was being restored in the sidewalk instead of in a garage, as required by the regulation.
The owner of the motorbike gritaba grossly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the official, with a bad side, opened up to the codazos until their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.

Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we verbally."
"Sometimes we struggled physically," said Mr Li with total naturally.
"most of the time it is the public that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not charge against Senator Ensign
Advocates of the senator announced on Wednesday that prosecutors in the justice department have either cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and its efforts to ensure work through lobby to the husband of the woman.
The decision ends the legal threat facing more serious Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, so that the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and bruised his career.
The office of Ensign said she was "certainly pleased" by the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The Senator could still face a disciplinary action by the Senate ethics committee.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of research and that it has no plan to lift charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, which said that seemed to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have confabulado for violating a ban on lobbying Federal Criminal.
The interviews, e-mail and other documents, were made public in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby to ensure the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the affair of the senator with her.
Ms Hampton once worked as treasurer of Ensign campaign.
Ensign was in contact with several sponsors politicians to find work to Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Like Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, was excluded according to the law of lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were friends before the intimate affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving Dorr lobbying ban ', which seeks to restrict that former state employees used their connections to do business.
The evidence that has been made public, "appeared to be a prima facie case of conspiracy to violate the Statute substantially revolving Dorr," said Stanley Brandt, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in defending clients being investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr Brandt and other ethical lawyers said that the department was cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several setbacks to its public integrity section, including the decision last year to abandon the indictment against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of misconduct of procedure.
Federal prosecutors are "clearly a cowardly," said Melanie sloan, executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a group that brought a number of complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul coggins, the main lawyer for Ensign, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor for the justice department on Monday and another more calls the next day, saying that the department did not want to lift charges against his client.
The defence team of Ensign had been cooperating with prosecutors in the attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to detail the legal arguments that he gave prosecutors.
"I do not feel comfortable in detail on my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we feel we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the federal elections Commission decided to change an investigation in a separate complaint with the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 to the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral Commission said that was not enough evidence to prove that the money was a gift.
NV energy is a major company of Nevada, who had supported for a long time senator, which managed to work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company agreed to Hampton as industry lobbyist, the chief of staff, John Lopez, Ensign was told with Hampton and said that he was "going over" the Ministry of the Interior on a disputed matter.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client of Nevada, and allegiant air, called the Secretary of transportation to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When I first came the news of the affair last year, Ensign asked for forgiveness from his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth leading Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists who planned run for a third term in the Senate.
When the speaker of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, said that the senator had hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude their investigation.
"Senator Ensign wishes to continue with their hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of Cheshire aimed to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them, "chateando" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, sent reports of gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defence, had more than 140,000 messages on Twitter on the process that went into the breach and children tied to their beds in a House which was once kindled fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to come to an end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty adopted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr Hayes have written in court that they delineate them the arguments of that probably will appeal to the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the persistent reports about the process, including the wide use of Twitter by journalists of mass media, created "a circus atmosphere," and such saturation and with details exaltadores made public passions really inappropriate influence over the jury.
The sweetener might force the appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"according to what I experienced during this process, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer chief of the defence of Mr Hayes.
The judge of first instance Jon C. blue, the State Supreme Court, rejected lacónicamente claims in a ruling last week, saying that news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury has been driven by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have recognised that the coverage of cases celebres may lead to questions about the fairness of the process.
In a historic ruling in 1966, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a osteopaths of Cleveland, Dr Sam sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the case sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television programme and the movie "the fugitive."
Some lawyers said the courts of appeals, which examined the condemnation of Mr Hayes half a century later, could be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be necessary to control the form of communication from the halls of the Court, something inimaginadable in the case of Dr sheppard.
"There is a reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in processes of high profile, said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford law school, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying that it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor donohue said that some judges of appeal could be intrigued by the idea that limit the immediate communication from the halls of the Court could make that the trials were more fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the issues outlined by the lawyers of Hayes, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying the execution.
The defense lawyers also argue that Hayes, for example, could have been damaged when the judge refused to allow them to testearan blue reactions potential juries, by painting photographs shocking of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that they were horrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their daughters, 17-year-old hayley and michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they also ask the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge improperly removió to a jury that he had criticized the prosecutors, and that incorrectly had lobbied for a verdict on his strange decision of it be possible to tell the jury deliberate over a weekend.
The panels were not abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract the most interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media constantly meant the excitement about the case.
"The crowding of the tweets of media cameras and reporters outside the court," wrote lawyers, "was something not seen here in new haven and perhaps throughout the state."
His attention in the coverage of tweeter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news were more important than the reports brought more slowly, were a ludita vision that would make the politics of the Court on the control of the coverage was weak in future.
But some lawyers said the courts of appeal often felt drawn to the arguments on the adjustment required in the courts because of technological and social changes.
The lawyers of Hayes are pushing for this claim.
In his writing, spoke about the decision of 1966 Supreme Court justices, repealing the condemnation of Dr sheppard due to the coverage of the process, and made clear that would require new media would require new rules.
"this case," wrote, "represents the case sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can the civility a bridge to connect the divisions?
After a campaign marked by the tirade and the negativity, this week has triggered a little civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation future or a time illusory before a rapid return to partisan battle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress produced no progress on the big issues that must be dealt with during the lame-duck session.
But by all accounts, was at least a polite discussion on the differences in the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, instead of just another episode gap to score partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Commission 's deficit President was equally civilized, despite the political differences that exist between Members.
It seems clear that the interaction close during a period of months generated a mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that still exists between the Members.
That is hardly enough to declare that it has received a new era of cooperation.
Now both sides are in a trial period, sondeándose each other to identify signs of cooperativismo and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and patience from voters to a renewed partisan war.
Which is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of the same on the part of the participants were made with a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and they are very deeply ingrained as to suggest any rapid change in the atmosphere that existed during the last two years.
Whether that is a question of taxes, spending, health care and social assistance, the two parties are poles apart.
Anyway, the election of November has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed the way of saying things," said pete wehner, a Bush administration official now at the centre of ethics and public policy.
"are inevitable after the election.
The elections are partisan passions, which are dying out.
That is a good thing ."
On some issues, in particular, those who appear in the order of the day of the lame-duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush administration tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way of preserving some or all of those reductions, so permanent or temporary.
Similarly, it is likely that there is a commitment to extend unemployment benefit, probably because the Republicans can do not believe we are in favour of the tax cuts for the rich, denied unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, there is greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the lame-duck session, along with the ratification of the new nuclear disarmament Pact start (strategic arms reduction treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, notes that the successful cooperation on pressing issues of the outgoing sitting there will necessarily lead to a continuous bipartisanship when the new 112do. Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, it is very likely and unavoidable, to begin a period of disagreement.
"after that things that are due to be carried out, in the short term, psychology will revert to a situation of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that civility can lead to a real cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a blueprint for the main event in 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the Constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, contributed decisively to its creation.
For more awareness with Republican leaders about the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to keep its promises to cut state spending and overturn the new law.
These partisan lines are already clearly in initial reactions against the recommendations of the Committee of deficit, including the reform of the tax code and increasing some taxes and retirement age, and cost cutting.
The Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to its own assessment, have introduced to force the issue of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Committee of 18 Members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been fighting to get close to that figure.
The more resistance is among elected officials in the panel, suggesting that on tax matters, at least there is currently little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the Republicans from the White House and the Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of clashes supporters, when the Republicans desafíen to Obama on the budget, tax and health care, followed then by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to a standstill, as happened in 1995, then both parties see the reaction of the people.
Anyone who feel that it is losing probably will change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and the polarisation are now higher than they were in the middle of the 1990s, and seems to have a wider ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress who had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in their time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo showing this week will be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A US document leaked portrays to Moscow as paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," and makes it a part of the bribes and money of protection that collects directly to the Kremlin, as reported in February, the US Embassy in Russia.
It reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge systems of blackmail, which helps to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not just of legitimate businesses, but also of organised crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "top-down authority," takes its part as the money climbs on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks in its Web site Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while he was still Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow, and blame him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev sacked him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean sweep since then.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently refused the allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several demands for libel over allegations.
In September, when in a Russian TV channel asked about a documentary that suggested that he was corrupt, said: "It is crazy, a canard, a nuisance."
According to the polls, the Russians believe so overwhelming that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, because they were in the report of the embassy, and it is extraordinary that the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links to the government of the city of Moscow with crime, have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to say that the government operates more like a kleptocracy that as a government," says the note.
"The criminal elements have a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and of the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection) which crosses the police, the Federal Security Service (sfs), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the office of the prosecutor, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"analysts identified a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The sfs, MVD and militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is a system ineffective in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide certain services."
The report states that the sfs collects the money from the bigger companies, and that the police points to small businesses.
A source, said the report, "explained that the Moscow business owners understand that the best thing is to ensure the protection of the MVD and sfs (instead of the organised crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, money and power that the criminal groups, but also are protected by law."
"for this reason, the protection against criminal gangs is no more a priority."
The letter notes that, while the collection of money is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay are quickly closed their businesses as a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has admitted he has achieved little progress.
The note from the embassy reports on men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"in its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy satarov, director of the group of experts from indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"but he is a part of this tape."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in the post 154 (the countries are classified in the least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the letter of the US Embassy, that did not happen until late at night when Moscow, surely will cause anger within the Russian Government, and despite that Luzhkov can be blamed for the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN for Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiosamente by a disclosure that said that American diplomats, Medvedev called Batman and Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is associated with our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, not we suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, that was done in a manner so immoral."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom, with concrete weakly illuminated stained walls and descascaradas, the director of high school anlong veng recalled the man who had constructed, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"We all love Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and was keen for his people," said sreng KOR Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" by its brutality during the Khmer Rouge commander, remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia, where it built clinics, bridges and other infrastructure, and still live thousands of former soldiers of the organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge were demanded to the government, the loyalty sustained for long is being finally challenged in anlong veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and reconciliation allowed victims who were publicly to people who had taken part in the scheme.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook of secondary school for the first time I taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in anlong veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and his attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they cannot do anything," said youk chhang, director of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"for them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within the families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979, the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary received the guerrilla war from bases in the mountains and forests in Western Cambodia, Ta Mok in anlong veng cultivated supporters.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN would lead to the country " s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters from the Khmer Rouge began to desert towards the government, culminating in the rendiciones of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the dangrek mountains nearby.
Died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of its benefactors, the more former Khmer Rouge fighters fell in absolute poverty that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few officials of elite of the Khmer Rouge continued with their local administrative jobs in return for abandoning its weapons, the soldiers rasos remain poor farmers and unskilled.
"These people have few benefits after the surrender," said Sok leang of the Center for justice and reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, even in anlong veng.
"They have built-in utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were bred without any concept to do business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge when I was a teenager in 1974, he fought in the jungle near anlong veng before he moves to life as poor rice farmer in 1998.
"life with the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
'Ta Mok gave him to eat at all. "
"But now the life is difficult because we have to autoabastecernos."
The current court of the Khmer Rouge has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, it is expected that the Court begins to prosecute Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the Court is on trial the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to these four.
This is not done much to calm fears in anlong veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on im chaem, 64, who was a district chief in the province of banteay meanchey during Khmer Rouge rule at the end of 1970.
In 2007, she told investigators the documentation centre of Cambodia, which had overseen the construction of the dam of trapeang thma, a project which is thought to have killed thousands of forced labour.
During a recent embarrassing later, IM chaem returned to work in the camps to their home on pilotes of wood in a path of land on the outskirts of anlong veng.
When the sun dropped long shadows on the parched grass, IM chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the Court would not convene.
"Cambodia is peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the Court is seeking to more suspects, although experts and historians.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said youk chhang, the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation, according to Rouge, is to pull together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to bring these pieces broken so that we can understand."
The centre was the first book of text approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, called "history of Democratic Kampuchea," 75 pages.
It was distributed in anlong veng in June as a supplement to the textbook on the history of secondary school, the Education Ministry, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of anlong veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the link of the city with the regime.
Apple valeak, 19, a student at the school in anlong veng, said that the new textbook helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But their parents reacted with scepticism when brought the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book of text and the Court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people who brought the Court."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation is complex and difficult, said Sok leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the Court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge have retained their charm.
In the dangrek mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered in plastic bags discarded leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a roof rusty of tin.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, 31, a seller of mobile phones on the edge of the road, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
"but he has a strong spirit of the place and a lot of people go there to rezarle," he said.
It was the birthday of nuom sothea, and later that day decided to walk up to the last resting place of Pol Pot, which would leave a bunch of bananas mature hoping for good luck.
Belarus refuses to give up its stock of uranium to weapons as
In a stunning victory for the campaign of President Obama to protect the nuclear material around the world, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that surrender its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, to the sidelines of a summit of security.
For years, the US Government had been trying to persuade Belarus that renounced its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return in the spring.
But American officials told the Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of uranium for weapons as an installation of Belarusian investigations.
This paved the way for the agreement on Wednesday to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the issue.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of the summit on nuclear security of 47 nations led by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"Actually, I was fascinated by the fact that want a place at the summit of nuclear safety in 2012."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken luongo, President of the society for global security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide within the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped to six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit of nuclear safety of Obama, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, saying that the nation never will not give up its uranium.
"We have maintained the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically disassociate uranium for weapons) and the low-enriched uranium," said Lukashenko in that time.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to them to anyone."
"use it for research purposes, is it '.
However, Belarus came to the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials said that the first task of removing uranium in Belarus, in October, was particularly difficult, because the material had been slightly irradiated.
The officials said that was loaded on a train travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility to storage and disposal.
According to the officials, the second operation was completed on Monday and was made by air.
The US government spent $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money is used for supply to Belarus the installation of investigations with uranium enrichment under, which is not ideal for nuclear weapons.
Andrew bieniawski, an official of the Department of energy, which operates in the reduction of global threat, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated carefully to strengthen the confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate their reserve towards 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the repression gritty of Lukashenko of human rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential détente.
It said that "while it welcomes the progress in these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognised that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is still an issue central to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens'.
The Spanish Government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not object to the CIA flights with Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners to Guantanamo in Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram to the US ambassador in Madrid.
Leaked documents reflect that WikiLeaks (lines) to the country, which adds that the then Deputy First Minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, demanded that the Spanish executive informed to "be able to prove that they were carrying out appropriate monitoring on foreign aircraft that are in Spain."
In June 2006, following a report of the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the report of the Council "had picked up the Zapatero government outside game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"The Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught by surprise," reported Aguirre in a cable.
The then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this issue the low profile as possible, although, to be in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited ability to influence."
For its part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez passed to the embassy that she would not seek to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of documents from the national intelligence centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"these reports do not contain any element incriminatorio nor any sensitive information," said the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected his concern at the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors Germans' of the information desclasificada the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case seamlessly between governments," laments Aguirre.
In March 2007 in a lunch meeting between the Ambassador of the US and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "if the Spanish judges are rabiosamente jealous of their independence and will do whatever they see fit," he had instructed his employees to avoid comments of inflamada rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature ."
The Ambassador also expresses its concern at the performance of the Partido Popular in this matter.
"despite its general orientation, pro-American, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any sign that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be construed as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government," says.

The popular gained four seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-n, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the substantial increase of votes and Members experienced in recent regional elections, the PP Catalan is already looking ahead to the general has advance, or not, the prospects are very positive, because the number of votes that this training in these elections often turn to which receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the popular vote in the 610.473 got Catalans general of 2008, while in the autonomous region of 2006, the figure had risen to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPP won 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has worked on a shift of votes of the PSC and the PP fidelización the electorate of this training, analysts have calculated that, if general elections, the PPP could go from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while ciu would also four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 members (has 25).
These calculations constatarían Catalan square that is fundamental to the PP and the PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a Member - now has three - while icv would get a Member or would one.
But, if the electoral timetable, the most immediate meeting will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive in the order of the Socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in his baton at the head of the regional government of Barcelona, one of the administrations most budget deals - 661 million euros by 2011.
Both are popular as nationalists in the possibility that the PSC loses Councils in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists did not obtain majority or possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and icv.
Given the Republican debacle, would not be unreasonable to this training will lose their representation in the Council barcelonés - is needed to get the 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capital and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to dominate the turnaround in the capital, where tarraconense ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has grown only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, met on several occasions.
The people have grown up in other municipalities as badalona, castelldefels or reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 local governments in Catalonia and is seeking to form lists in the highest number of people.
The Catalan cell gave thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, in Thailand, there were three
Seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the Commissioner General of information from the police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell, which run from Thailand, it provided passports to different groups of al-Qaeda, including "the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and" Laskar E taiba (let), the last of the attacks in Mumbai that caused the deaths of 106 people in 2008.
The Interior Ministry has attached great importance to this research, to the point of ensuring that the "operation kampai" has been "weakened" the apparatus of falsification of al-Qaeda at international level and, therefore, its operational capacity ."
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were fake and then distributed to groups that make up the criminal galaxy al-Qaeda for their "combatants" cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell destamantelada is not the only one that the jihadist network had deployed in Europe, we have been involved in the research, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, are therefore not ruling out that in the territory of the EU is carried out in the next few days similar coups to develop on the night of Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (were arrested Pakistanis junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan Begum, tanveer arshad and the Nigerian babatunde agunbiade), in Thailand was developed another with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan ehsan butt and the sirikanlaya kijbumrung Thai.
These were the directing from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of it was battered in 2009 - robaba mainly to tourists passports that comply with the requirements set by the so-called "world Islamic front."
That is, the documents should be on behalf of men aged between 25 and 45 years, valid for several years and without visas estampadas.
By means of research underlines that, for now, has not found any evidence that links the arrested in Catalonia in the attack in Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and taiba," has been one of the groups recipients of passports stolen in Spain and then fabricated in Thailand.
However, it is worth remembering that days before she was carried out this attack, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer Agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the "command" that took the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires more than aparque fiscal relations
The leader of the PPP, Alice sánchez-camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to discuss personally to Artur Mas their conditions to support his appointment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already put forward during the campaign and summarised in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and lay filo-soberanistas adventures, as is the economic system that the nationalist leader wants to raise at the halfway point in his term.
The President of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with security which have gained 18 Members in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to be wanting, since the ciu candidate needs at least one of the courses that will have the opposition should abstain in the vote on your appointment.
A possible Entente with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections, but, for now, the discussions that these days is more with the rest of key political leaders are in Catalan.
And as far as the President of the Partido Popular, to support an appointment "to park all the speeches sovereignists and independent," as well as the economic system - similar to the Basque country - which the convergent leader seeks to even put to a referendum.
The two leaders do have in common is their commitment to slim down the political apparatus of an autonomous administration very inflated and the elimination of the inheritance tax and donations.
The details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will, on the part of the CFP, Jordi cornet and dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (icv) and today do so with Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (ciutadans) and Joan laporta (solidaritat Catalan).
The geriatric care claims that the deaths were not for "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of olot not precluded his prison killing more than 11 elderly
The leaders of the geriatric care caritat of olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage that has been caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila dilmé, the nurse that while I was there employee killed at least eleven elderly in her office.
The Director of the residence appeared, Joan room, accompanied by the counsel of the centre, the lawyer Joan Glen, and announced that "the desire of the caritat would be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and the responsibility we have to take on the situation of civil authorities."
And it is the social prestige that could suffer the entity for not being detected in time the criminal activities of the prison, the great threat to the caritat is now form of substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila dilmé has admitted that the first crime goes back to August 2009, and since then has not ceased to kill.
The judge has already pointed out in the car and ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric care - which I suspect that in many cases no doctor exploraba personally to the dead but that at the age and the illness of patients, it despachaba process by telephone.
The caritat, through its director, denied yesterday rejected this and said that "the lack of measures may not have been in no time the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer added that "in the caritat because there is not a single indication that there was a reckless action by any other person who is not their own accused."
Already dubbed the "Angel of death" confessed to the 11 murders and detailed the first crime they committed on 29 August 2009 for a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case led to the death pinchándole an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he committed the aid of a mixture of pellets sedatives.
The Director of the caritat notes that it is difficult to verify that the staff at the centre have access to medicines.
The sensations of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in their zeal to alleviate the suffering of the inmates used to give them to death.
But the analysis that are being done in the lab, which will have to clarify whether Vila do not lie and sought to its first victims a death less cruel or if, on the contrary, the abrasó inside giving them bleach has already admitted that he did with the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In the caritat give credibility to the demonstrations of the prison, nor even the number of avowed murders, which do not exclude that higher, and justify its attitude in different versions that has given Vila on their visits to the Court and in the little sense that has to change their way of having been, with success, eight murders.
That is why I say that they are put to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat yesterday of Trichet warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability of reaction."
The peripheral spreads have closed with strength and shares of European banks have risen more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB and the euro just wrong to have both begun picking up something that is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday in a market like that ilíquido collapses recovers but motivated by closure of short and very speculative.
The institutional investor wants to lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB we cited today to withdraw liquidity measures and they will have to retractar tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the left.
The Bundesbank demanded complete the plan of buying of government debt by ineffective and removing all the extraordinary liquidity measures to term and leaving only unrestricted access to week.
After the Irish crisis we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and keep the quarterly auction with unrestricted access to the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with its programme of buying bonds and even to give the signal to reinforce it.
If they fail to comply with the expectations generated will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and stubborn if they continue to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
As in their meeting in May in which they said they had not seen the buying of bonds and collapsing markets, tomorrow could be repeated history.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazuca Monday and Wednesday said they had already bought much, causing a market crash.
Yesterday the auctioning of letters a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million per 5,28%, versus 750 million a 4,81% from the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, has published the figures the hole of allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures ladies are some 10 million to the short term and other potential 15,000 and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are achievable within the plan of assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to win parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have sufficient support, so that Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has mitigated the tone of the speech to ease tension ahead of the forthcoming summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which there is a need for a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a Union, and that all we touch the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch to Wagner and the rest the Ode to Joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President had the gift of the opportunity to present yesterday that the action plan approved on Friday the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive the employment ringing in the ears of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and zp explains that the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, twice the rest of European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise result.
Today there is an auction of a bond to three years will benefit from the effect Trichet for what we hope will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For Spain to ask an aid plan would be a self-immolation.
We would create a line of liquidity that we do not need the Treasury have more than $40 billion in liquidity available three times the rate in March, to exorbitantly expensive and full access to the markets sine díe.
However, the strategy must continue to be the woman of Caesar, "in addition, appear to be the case."
Mind, we can.
The President of eulen will be opposition, the board of Vega Sicily requested by their children
The storm not abates in the conflict in the family Álvarez, and the owners of eulen enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will be opposition, considering it "zero," the full judicial board of the enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and that they will try to assert his majority and be done with the bodies of management of the signing holder of wineries Vega Sicily.
David Alvarez and his son Jesus David and María José are sharpening up the battery for the new chapter in their legal dispute over control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company appears willing to compromise on their dispute to be present in the governing bodies of the enebro.
Its board of directors was descabalgado by five of their seven children who were appointed administrators in the House of shareholders of 18 January this year and whose challenge is noted in the commercial register.
The Board of the judicial enebro for next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the commercial number 2 of Madrid, has opened up the can of worms within the family Alvarez.
The appeal judge to fix the House is, until it resolves the dispute, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the junta.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal of applicants for their five children, through subtle procedural law, in clear fraud and abuse of the right, try to validate the junta and entirely void of 18 January," according to its official spokesmen.
This argument would be the basis for that, once held the junta, proceed with its challenge to the view that it is full of "zero."
The same players, who maintained a discreet silence, already attempted without success to the magistrate convened a board in June.
In the society enebro, heritage and holder of wineries Vega Sicily, among other assets, the seven children of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of service calls, however, the harvest on 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the fundamental issue that should decide the judge once the view on the demand of challenge, for which there is still significant date.
Red Bull wins in formula with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software engineers improvements in cars in real time.
Since that Red Bull burst into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by the surprise and for the success.
In a prime time nobody took into consideration the options of a escudería newly arrival and, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, last November, at the end of the championship all gambled on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the skill as pilot of the eventual champion, German Sebastian vettel, nor of engine capacity Renault to drive his car in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
In fact it is a powerful simulation software processes that the German put on the market in 2007 for the purpose of the automotive top-class.
So-called plm, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design line of factories manufacturing plants around the world, energy, high precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulating the product or the process before building it so real, and avoiding the unnecessary expenditure.
Plm facilitated the development of the cameras, the Sukhoi planes or cars utility giants of Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this instrument in its factory computer Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull devise and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes, changes and improvements that have appeared in careers and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the escuderías in 1992 had an average of 10 points in his team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team working today 180 young professionals of high qualifications, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and cast all kinds of changes in the bólidos.
The manager explained that Siemens plm software is able to analyse and enhance all elements of the bólidos of Red Bull, with the exception of the engine, which is the full responsibility of Renault.
Amending the materials, the fuel, the aircrafts and security elements.
The changes can lead to the virtual reality of the simulador to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production through lasers and high-tech autoclave.
As only limitation of this madness of technological development is the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of Formula 1 can spend as much as possible in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the factory of high technology to design and produce their bólidos in a village about 50 miles from London.
Two buildings in which are restricted visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that is happening is considered "top secret."
The template for this amounts to 580 people, including his two pilots, the champion vettel and mark webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 Red Bull, certainly, is the recent champion Sebastian vetell.
Among the daunting technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of their participation in the channels, are hiding other players whose tender is invaluable and their reputation stagnated.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve nevey, says that five years ago, you could say that the progress of R & D in the cars of carriages gave the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology amount 85% of success, while the pilots provide 15% of the value added.
Nevey acknowledges that the vettel and webber will never be replaced by the technology because "are gladiators unpredictable."
Hp in two years with 20 shops own local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (hp) opened its first store in Barcelona yesterday exclusively in collaboration are its partner Pont kings.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square metres, the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company compatibilizará this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC city, Carrefour, built and the English court.
The Vice-President of hp Spain, Helena Herrero, set the example the remodelled shop located in the great way barcelonesa, ownership of Pont Reyes, who works for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 points of sale in Europe in 2013, brand strategy that includes 20 shops in Spain.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week in Barcelona, with the third.
Blacksmith declined to disclose the following any overtures, although admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of hp personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install the shops will always be the same, buttressed by a local dealer with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advising and ensures the exclusive furniture design shop (with products that can be addressed interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, hp covers staff training institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it was part of a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of retail is to "improve customer service and to SMEs in the purchase, the attention, after sales and even packaging."
The store in Barcelona includes an area with a pioneering pilot programme at world level, which is in charge of addressing the possible problems of computer equipment to HP in guarantees.
An online service connecting with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"this system is designed especially for SMEs and consumers, since the big companies already have provided technical assistance services" Helena Herrero, indicated yesterday.
Sabadell bid for 'stealing' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, the assistant deputy for bank sabadell, Jaime guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking industry, but rules out initially a new liquidity crisis and is predicting the end of the war of the liabilities.
Despite this, provides for a collapse in the margins of interests, that they will try to offset in part by increases in committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell expected win in three years a million individual customers, its outstanding problems.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will be launched in 2011 a new plan director who will have a period of three years.
The objective, in addition to survive without the need for recourse to State aid of frob, is winning market share with the capture of a million new individual customers -700.000 if we can get out of the descuentan - his main preoccupation, which until now had cosied up more to small businesses and companies at the retail customer.
This year captured 250 individual customers and 50 companies.
Its market share in individuals is of 3.5%, while in companies exceeds 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011-2013 plan is a gamble for productivity, or of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges the will raise the bank when you present the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to set itself objectives and make them public as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the banking world.
Sabadell, indeed, will close this year his plan director optima set four years ago, although I was initially for three, but the situation of the markets made it extended a year.
Customers who let the savings banks will be its main objective.
At a breakfast meeting organised by the apie, guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult year" and far-reaching.
The executive, indeed, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "sluggish."
In addition, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create jobs," vital to the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the liabilities - which penalises the márgenes- is falling, the price of risk premiums that banks and building societies are paying for their emissions to obtain liquidity are shifting as the price of credit to offset the fall in the margins.
"the issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and is going to be a factor of pressure on the loan."
"We have not dried up, but the differences are higher," guardiola acknowledged.
BANESTO already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and increase the price of the -ver spreads cincodías of 22 and 27 November.
Also recognized that the trend of banking now "is to raise committees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The plan director of sabadell is based on the organic growth, although, as always, the group has not ruled out corporate operations.
Not in vain, ensures that in Spain "is going to require larger sizes."
"next year is going to change everything," he assured.
He says that the capital needs are "very well" and is not ruling out that Spanish financial institutions into the red.
And it points to the frob can close to the market in the uptake of funds to new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, shrugged off what some bankers predicting already as a new liquidity crisis.
That cannot be broadcast, but the opposite of what happened in June, it can obtain financing in the short term through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC ruling out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and returned to insist on the speed with which it is implementing the restructuring of the sector.
When it began the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks, were several entities that were assured that it would not participate in this first phase and would reserve for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Confederation Spanish savings banks (ECSC), José Antonio olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I believe that the largest part of mergers, the incorporation of cajasol civic banking group cannot be said to be a second round, there are adjustments."
"the majority is completely made; they may instead of 17 go to 13 or 14 but all procedures have been done and tutelados by the Bank of Spain, that has worked extremely well," said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of directors and executives of Aragón (adea), olavarrieta has stated that the process of concentration is "the greatest speed possible, and we must be very pleased, as is happening at the time that in its day, not now, have been set in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain" emphasized.
"moving from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that is unprecedented in history, reducing the number of entities with a 62% to be much more big to meet with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of views rather unfortunate on the slow process" that demonstrate a "lack of seriousness and respect," because "What does the Bank of Spain is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta, promised yesterday that Spain has the financial system more rigorous across Europe and "probably" in the world, and attached to those who call into question "a lack of knowledge."
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic climate, "we can be very content" with the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of concentration "very important" and that "is the greatest speed possible."
Also recalled that the Spanish banks it was very successful staging of the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line.
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
The tensions in the markets have led to a double government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new measures of adjustment, from tax cuts to SMEs, regulation of private agencies placement or removal of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without provision, until the privatisation of the 49% of aena, the management of the Barajas airport and the Prat and 30% of the state lotteries.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former president, Felipe González, who has joined the criticism of the cancillera Angela Merkel for his responsibility in triggering the current crisis.
How we interpret such movements?
It goes without saying that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its information policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And that Germany has a radical new view of what should be their future, which is incompatible with maintaining the traditions of much of its partners.
Compared to the European resistance, in Germany begins to especularse on three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated with herself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the South would abandon the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seem like science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals germanas macro-economic control of budgetary rigour, penalties for violators, possible defaults of any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the prospective adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission estimulaban deficits, the German Government came up with a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of difference between what Germany believed that this should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in the public finances), and what they were practising their European partners, including France.
The second in the Central European country against gave the painfully when Merkel took the decision to rescue of Greece.
By then, was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, once again, Merkel has emerged with a clear position, calling for the reform of the Treaties of the Union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, forcing private lenders to pay part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, which precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat watered down, has been adopted and, in the next few months, we should assist the process of reform of the Union which makes those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think cross.
And telling us all that, but now it has to do with those that perhaps is not very much in agreement, from that date the former operation of the euro, it will be over.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries offenders will be severely punished, may be forced to file for suspension of payments and, in this case, the private sector would put up much of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a harsh way of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption and improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based in debt and building, with huge holes in the balance of payments, as the Spanish growth that has prevailed in the years of the boom, simply not going to tolerate.
The issue is clear.
And we would be wrong not to understand.
This is not just to bring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we require is much harder.
And the worst thing in these circumstances we could do is deceiving ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence leave step to greater peace of mind.
And use the window of opportunity that we have given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the President Zapatero also has understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after the meeting on Saturday with big business and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, has blazed a trail the thesis that we must to get home.
But the red line that Germany has set, and do not think that will change.
And, between the opportunities provided for, to abandon a monetary zone too atiborrada of countries that are not serious, it cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany provided we can say that it had informed us.
Sport and fraud law
Wiles as Alonso and Ramos to Ajax show ingenuity but unwilling to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly carefully nurtured by two players of real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party contested on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to write about if such behaviour is unsporting and whether or not, possibly, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to break the party (his team clearly had won), the two players deliberately lost time to draw two fouls to lead to the referee they demonstrated the second yellow card.
That way, and as the Real Madrid will end up as leader of his group, both players will comply with the sanction of the order the next game, against the liguilla auxerre, clean of cards and can move to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned with two games to the coach, Jose mourinho, and with different amounts of economic players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not new, but rather in the world of football.
It is so widespread that form part of the ethos of the unwritten rules, but followed, this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case referred to is that has been perpetrated by a team of the entity of the Real Madrid (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that in the past has fined similar acts to their players for) and the drama orchestrated, apparently by mourinho, who adds one more episode in its long history of technical sweeping and provocative.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these are committed fraud law; because, in effect, are actions that sporting regulation, but seem to avoid.
The issue is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, and that with these actions are not endangered, that is to say, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which it refers to the play is to prevent the team from the players offenders will unfairly the opposing team, which also happened.
However, the paradox of the action of the players from Real Madrid is not acomodó what normally we characterize as trap or fraud law, since its infringement of the rules was not done behind closed doors to try to avoid punishment, but that their action was to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They expected and agreed to accept the punishment.
Another question is what kind of advantage get offenders in the intentional mistakes.
Here, it seems necessary to see which are not put at a disadvantage to the rival or are benefiting from the same party, because obviously the result of the action is to own a team with fewer players.
And it is also a useful strategy for the next game, then the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards could threaten his participation in a future party.
But it is an advantage in the long term, with a certain degree of equivocation, because the team can be eliminated at the first opportunity, and in addition to this the players meet a party of sanction and spend the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards comes with a less than in the first round.
So that, through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, which is part of the strategic decisions to take maximum advantage of what the rules.
In the course, the players did not act to avoid the implementation of the sanction (that would be a clear case of fraud law), but rather when elected to it.
Made a strategic decision without circumvent the punishment or flee the same.
Although the border between genius and fraud law is unclear on this occasion I believe that it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, by two factors: because it was two autoexpulsiones and by the way it conducted the transmission of the provocarlas guideline.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions do not is both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive to attract offers in Christmas dinners NCB
The dictatorship of the timetable is this year a flood of reservations for 16 and 17.
Start the celebrations autosufragadas for employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also pooled dinners prior to Christmas, continue to exercise of breathing space for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive prices adjusted for the customer to obtain majority: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dining or meals, coincide with entrepreneurs and industry associations interviewed.
To complicate the accounting, the timing of this year (after the new year on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of 13 December, with the result to date of a flood of reservations of dining for days tip (16 and 17) and just the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when it started the stage in lean times, many companies have eliminated collective dining on the budget.
Not to dispense with the tradition, many workers the keep paying for their own pocket.
Whatever the economic demand and prices of battle, confirms the President of the restauració gremi of Barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative for employers, today, does not dare to predict how they will be celebrating this month.
"People thinks long before booking."
"wants to get out but have alerts heated on the issue of prices," notes.
The business will be well "to the quality of good price and good service," he adds, and recalls that clients tend to fall down a stepping stone to the crisis, so that the Strip at around EUR 25 has become in demand.
In a poll in various establishments centrally located notes the collapse of petitions to the night of 17.
In the Group soteras indicate that there is a real boom in applications for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, which have responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In one of the most powerful groups, andilana, with 16 shops in the city (3-room pension of Rita, market, the Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has meant more early reserve, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 until 30 euros," detailing.
In an grup, championed by the mussol, attic, ququ, and up to a total of 23 local, remain optimistic after detecting a boom of the turnover from the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The sources stress that 18 will also be a day hiperactivo to a group of friends that precelebran parties.
Their six menus of group added one Christmas, with the EUR 30 or more as a budget item and the perception that there is willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, as a dig.
They also see green shoots in some companies that are once again invite their employees and feeling that the size of the groups is something more.
On the part of employers fecasarm (which includes entities such as the association of bars, restaurants and leisure of Barcelona), his Vice-President, enric gomà, hopes to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall the reservations are "lively," although customers "traded up."
So yes, hope for the commemoration has not fallen, Bill pay, suggests.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons to "faster than any other country."
Leaks of WikiLeaks confirms the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the portal WikiLeaks confirms the huge concerns that causes in Washington, the Pakistani nuclear program.
Despite the enlightening and juicy details that offer on the content of the talks and the thoughts of the representatives American diplomats accredited in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both countries in the field of nuclear safety, instead of going to increase, "falls," and the unstable Asiatic country produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country in the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not ensambladas but which are stored by components to hinder its destruction in case of ataque-- is one of the main reasons of devotion in Washington.
It lists the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a preliminary report to the visit of the then national security adviser, James Jones: "the proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumoreada dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The high number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and in the programmes of missiles is viewed, not only for America, but also for Russia, as proliferante and reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the collapse of the cultural and educational levels, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear or missile programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most innovative of the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is decreasing cooperation between America and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the high rate of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
An office of the embassy in May, which it describes as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues: "transparency is often non-existent; the offers of assistance are unanswered or are excluded."
In another message, Peter lavoy, national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a rate faster than any other country in the world."
The Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, that makes it "very clear" to the charge that "the army of Pakistan must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
The hunting of the head of WikiLeaks
Obama appoints a high responsible for the fight against terrorism in order to avoid any further leaks.
Interpol issued a red alert in order to follow the movements and to locate Assange is.
Everything to do with WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "find and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dating from 20 November.
And it has to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million of US diplomatic documents but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the Creator of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
It was the day 20 when the international police task force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but is not revealed until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
So, the 188 countries of Interpol have information to identify or trace Assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a man hit by a red alert, many of the Member countries, as explained by the organization, we believe the so-called network notice to proceed with an arrest -- must tackle the Spanish national police, particularly if they have a bilateral agreement on extradition, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it believes it is Assange.
The movement has outraged advocates of Assange, which yesterday issued a letter claiming that the founder of WikiLeaks, 39, has been prepared to respond by video link to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
Remember also that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the prosecutor in his case, which compares with the legendary pavlovich lavrentiy Beria, the head of security of Stalin.
"This seems a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter.
As the world seeks - and since Australia her mother argues the innocence of their hijo-- Assange fate remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday from an unknown place gave an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that it was responsible for ordering espiaran American diplomats at the UN, in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, should resign," he said.
His opinion was much condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who he described as "ridiculous and absurd," the petition of resignation.
"I am not entirely sure why we must import the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high head of counter-terrorism, rusell travers, to prevent further losses of documents.
The attempt by the spokesman of President Barack Obama for downplaying Assange contrasts with views that these days they conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, Congressman that from January will preside over the national security committee in the Lower House, has asked the State Department to look into the possibility of including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to intervene and its funds and prosecute any that are of any help or assistance."
Further still has gone Tom flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has had to withdraw after saying that "Assange should be killed."
"Obama should make this goal and use an unmanned plane or something."
He did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the Presidency.
"Whoever is in government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be a punishment too polite," declared in the chain Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with wink to the like-minded Carod
The Republican leader will enable the party a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a more pluralistic and the end of the asambleario system.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth revolt within the ranks of ERC, without North by the loss of 11 Members, and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware that his wasting its efforts of resignation is insufficient for the allied ex-leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted as his own mentor and that in any way it can cause headaches with other currents extinct.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will attempt to win over the new critics with polite to insulate themselves to the local elections.
For a start, puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will rule on their continuity in secret.
Through ballot papers, and not of hands.
If the carodistas want to provide a vote of punishment to the President, will do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as the submission to her person.
In several interviews, said he would not be ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without specifying percentages, that would also be good outcome "to the Bulgarian."
The next to Carod demand the President something more that put his office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not sufficient when puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But without the majority needed to force resignations, will try to agree with the executive a roadmap in May.
For that, expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reflection document that will address the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to bail out puigcercós in exchange for this promising to bring forward the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which those already taken for granted.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" undermines stability and that its aim is to do that, once and for all, the organisation will be able to wash the dirty linen of doors inwardly.
In this respect, it is symptomatic of the article that the conseller in office Josep huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologue of puigcercós, the holder of innovació assumed that the leader will be signed "in exchange for various objectives."
And listed five, two stand out.
The first, "fix" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, include new faces come from the sector akin to Carod.
The second may be big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC wound up once and the asambleísmo as mechanism works.
So, calls for a reform of the statutes will hold meetings through elected delegates.
Put an end to the model asambleario, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the team, which already puigcercós batalló in this regard in the past two congresses.
In fact, the convulso conclave of 2008 brought the charged in the direction of the review in a Congress asambleísmo specific reform of staff regulations.
This quotation is internal, because the tide of recent years desaconsejaba deal with the matter.
Now, without critical areas lying in wait, can be a good time to pick it up and try to close it for ever.

China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of the country in the COP16 assured that his country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that maintains its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent of its emissions of greenhouse gases.
China maintains its offer to between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020, sealed his Wei, a representative of that country in the COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16 conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Wei was assured that his country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and convert its industry.
Indeed, in the past four years their country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, he made clear that China will not change their goals, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
That the strategy towards China on climate change is divided into four business units: dialogue; construction of skills; construction of institutions and to support pilot programmes.
In all these areas there have been developments, including passage last year of a new energy law, which covers the objectives in terms of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in concert with state and local, to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficiency and reduction of emissions.
In addition, abundó, are in progress or already concluded multi-annual programmes, both funded by the Chinese Government, and by governments of other countries.

Attached to legality expulsion wire: Caesar Nava
The national leader of bread he detailed to the former leader panista is their right to go to the National Committee to complain to their right.
The national leader of bread, Caesar Nava Vázquez, ensured that the expulsion of Manuel wire barrientos was attached to the law and that the former leader panista is their right to go to the National Committee to complain to their right.
In interview after taking the protest of gabino Cué monteagudo as Governor of the state, said that in any case the expulsion wire is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission in order to sound."
"Mr Hawthorn has its right to go, in her case, via complaint to the Commission of the National Council, so that is a decision taken in the area of a competent body," wrote.
On the other hand, made clear that it is not time to think about 2012 and that was never on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action will emerge strengthened from the election within the next 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be chosen.
"This (an alliance in the 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and the goal," spoke.
The leader panista affirmed that the bread support it 71 years of dialogue, so that "not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary," the experience and it strengthens, "acotó.
He said that the Council will choose the best or the best leader to demand national action for the next three years, so that will deliver the "to whom the Council sets."
"I have this absolute peace and openness, any of the five would be proud to give the office of the President of the Party."

"for now it comes to accompany the governor gabino both you in this task."
In this context, stressed that the three governments from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the subject of comment around the country, hence "many hopes, aspirations are in them, and I am sure that gabino match expectations."
To be asked about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the context of the four years of his government, Caesar Nava called the priistas to reflect on the sexenios of ex-presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that the start to defend; that comes out of the closet," he said.
The opinion that the head of the federal executive can make expressions as he did in his speech at the national auditorium, because in the country there is no gag far less censorship.
Promoting Obama on Twitter law in favour of undocumented students.
"If coincides to approve the law dream act is appropriate, call your senators and ínstalos to legislation," tweeteó President estadunidense on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined today at the national rally in support of the dream act, a bill to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If coincides to approve the law dream act is appropriate, call your senators and ínstalos to legislation," tweeteó Obama.
His brief message kept open a cyber liaison with a broader document that calls for the public to communicate immediately with the senators, given that the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"with a vote which is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," says.
The message was released after the 42 senators Republicans threatened to block the vote of any legislation, at least to approve the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the funding of the government.
Blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 senators Republicans, could affect the vote of the dream act and other projects such as the ratification of the new start treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the blockade to the Republican dream act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once solved the tax issue, it will be able to set a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I think there are a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the issue before the end of the fiscal year..."
"I think that we can achieve an agreement in some time on this, and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that would call a "vote of shutting down debate" to the law dream act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the dream act would legalise the American dream to 800 000 young people who came to the United States before 16, remained in the country the past five years and joined an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters needed 60 votes to approve the initiative, which would require the support of a handful of Republicans, with the draft party organizations aiding lobbying hard to ensure the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of which supports the dream act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of nebraska, have said they will vote against, and only a Republican has voiced support for the law, Richard place of Indiana.
Therefore, the supporters of the dream act require add several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to back to the initiative.
Among the Republicans are the most cortejados senadoras from Maine, Olympia snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George lemieux, of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported in the past the dream act are orrin hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they have declared that they support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain, has defined its position at the moment.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the dream act is facing the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put the finger on the pulse
The second round of the pleasures of the language was a ride where participants showed the narrative
"that the sex in the language they understand but... the finger? What is expected of me?," inquirió the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the pleasures of the language, cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of your question (in another festival the Roundtable devoted himself to the sex in the language, he explained).
The finger... "puts us in trouble," espetó dulcemente the writer Argentina to the public, mostly young people, which was quoted in the Guadalajara International Book Fair (fil) to listen to this Roundtable diminished by marisol Shultz and where participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra montero and Luis García montero.
Luisa Valenzuela reading a text devoted to Gonzalo celorio and Shultz would define later as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist in search of what "pulse," going from doctor to doctor, of those who do not get answers but trails in the same thread narrative.
The infectólogo goes convinced: "patience is not my strong, perhaps my head."
In the end, after a frustrated rapprochement with the traumatólogo that has robbed the encouragement in half of the corridor, but whom he clarifies that spot is not a scientific term; it is the psicoanalista who reveals the mystery: "The problem is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "the pulse only managed to open what is real and that does not exist," but believes that the pleasures and the trappings of the language must be very interlinked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a deleitosa narrative entitled praise of invention, where the finger is not named but at a time is discovered.
With dashes of magical realism, consideration of a famous sorceress, that the same turn clouds, I came back to men who had gone far or reparaba the virtues that had lost a doncella, narrative shifted to talk then America, the great novel which could not there from the beginning its own journalists that the budgeting and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticise the excesses of the banked by captains conquerors.
"Cervantes we invented all (writers) made mockery of witnesses rubber-stamp sham that appeared in the stories submitted as real, but otherwise had never come to tell the story of America with imagination which lacked until the decency."
However, he stressed "are fools and liars best imagine" and is where converging reality and lie, where we no longer know what recounted belongs to one side or the other, where the literature of fiction reaches its peak.
We actually called the "tradition cervantina '.

In turn, the writer Mayra montero acotó and applauded the variety of interpretations that led the invitation of the fil with his round table the finger on the pulse.
The cubana-puertorriqueña pointed his towards the great problems of social violence within their country - and shares fact product of the disputes of the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that the good literature, the good poetry, the good songs contain a tacit compromise which of course is not premeditated," he said, after mentioning that the reality of the literature is the communication and the size of the compromise that is made between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction."
The night the closed the Spanish poet Luis García montero whose speech also did focus "of the finger on the pulse of writer committed writer."
Consider that in a world which lives in haste, also in the customs intellectuals and control of consciences in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every claim there is a small and not behind every denial there is a small yes."
"to be masters of our thinking and masters of the reality we have to qualify, and qualify means many times put his finger on the pulse and annoying to those who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and annoying to the powers that they prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting recovering a sense of writing.
Romano is going for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but has managed to achieve in three times the number decisive.
With the grief of Santos gap and Monterrey in the end, also faced two different styles marked by their technicians, who find themselves with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but has managed to achieve in three times the number decisively, although until now it has gone in white, and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
Argentina has finished consolándose with the coin of subcampeón, there has been a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The strategist santista reached his first final as coach in 2002, when the tournament took up the reins of morelia to global fell to 4-2 before toluca; then, in the end 2003 also came to grief decisive and also lost with global 3-1 and was precisely to rayados.
As with Santos gap, in the tournament bicentenary 2010, once again, the devils rubén returned to suffer a setback, as his team ended drawn 2-2 before the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the wave of pénaltis was ahead 3-1 with two chances to clinch the title for their last three players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the boomerang 4-3.
Rubén already lost two finals with the red devils and with Monterrey, its rival, in turn, therefore does not want to suffer the same fate, seeks to emerge from the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to get out champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, by a passion to which I must and will lead to the title to my, but this is the most important thing," said the helmsman when they are questioned about the numbers are against playing the end.
The end is very relevant, of which, secures, has learned a lot, "the only education that we can take is that until the referee silbe the end we can celebrate, we are prepared to check, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties by throwing out because we were ready to run, and I believe that this is a lesson which will finish the party can celebrate."
Know that this number could be defined in criminal shot, something that is not worried, because he trusts his players: "you never seeks the wave of criminal, you want to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is not another and we must be prepared, in the tournament before we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move the destination, sometimes by nerves or the anxiety of having the title in the hands, but we did, we left something to this end that we hope in this instance."
Romano has in its hands to be a technical subcampeón and prove for the first time the glory that give the titles.
America is changing rules for visa
People have to go to the centres of service for visa applicants before his interview in the consular section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.

The total cost of dealing with the visa will be lower, will no longer be necessary to make a down payment for the appointment, another payment to process the application of visa and other more for the courier service handing over the document.
The candidate will only make a single payment, which will cover the three services.

NASA will announce that outer life
The US space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact on the search for living beings in space.
The administration for the national aeronautics and space (NASA) of the United States will make tomorrow, Thursday, a discovery astrobiológico, that could prove the theory that outer life exists.
The findings will be presented at a press conference on Thursday at 1 p.m. in the NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiología, science described as the task of examining the origin, evolution, and future of life in the universe.
To quote the press, NASA will present "a finding that will impact on the search for life," outer, leading to speculation by experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures to the couple our and hostile environments that are deemed uninhabitable, and would in the possibility of becoming intelligent beings as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently this is a microbe that was found at the bottom of the monkey lake in the yosemite national park, California, where he lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous to any form of life, as the Lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this capability increases the possibility that life could exist on other planets similar, which do not have our atmosphere weak.
According to astrobiólogos, whether these bodies use arsenic in their metabolism, will be demonstrated that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will make the true extent of the findings in a press conference on Thursday.
At the conference will take the geobióloga pamela Conrad, who is investigating the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven benner, one of the scientists who study titan may (the largest moon of Saturn), under the prospect that their chemistry is similar to that of the earth.

Illegal immigration will be combated without problems
The draft law of conservatives who, according to the government, should solve the problem of boats full of illegal migrants, are likely to face strong opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am speaking primarily in the letter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that pisáis," declared the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its present form, that would stop up to a year to anyone who comes from a transport vessel identified as illegal immigrants, infringes the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms.
The leader of the bloc of Quebec, Gilles duceppe, indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against it, and all the opposition parties are against the project, so that we will see what the government," said Mr duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticism that his party is not sufficiently strongly with illegal immigrants.
"The neodemócratas agree that action is taken against the illegal boats and that is what we want with another bill, the c-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill for the Conservatives because it attacks the refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year," explains Mrs Chow.
The immigration minister Jason kenney, has accused the party of the position of playing politics and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians say to Members that do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if it were a doormat."
"They hope that Canada will take some firm action," does the Minister kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which could lead to the country for election as a result of their refusal.
However, a conservative qmi told the Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every Member who will oppose explain later to their constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite that had announced the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a committee of public consultation on the issue.
The Minister of public security, Robert dutil, supports this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the department of investigation in New York is question since January last year.
The metropolis has a standing against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement on Tuesday, taken by surprise to more than one.
It is true that, during a meeting of the permanent Council of the police services of Quebec held on 29 October, are never discussed this measure despite the presence of Robert dutil.
That was enough for the quebequense critical of the party that is the issue of public safety, Stéphane bergeron, call this announcement as "a rabbit from the hat" and as "a cheap solution of last minute."
The Minister dutil, for its part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"veréis results when we announce it," says simply.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the csq, réjean parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public inquiry.
"The more insists Mr Charest in preventing the creation of this committee of inquiry, most people share our view, that is to say, that has something to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a committee of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National Academy of public administration.
To get out of this impasse, suggests to Quebec which gives a special mandate to the auditor general to conduct a survey on the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor General," it concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the controller the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent troupe is not the only project in the making in the government Charest.
Quebec also asks to Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code for is better suited to this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of the operation marteau, reported the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of research.
The Federal Minister of public security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his counterpart of justice, rob Nicholson, tilting at present to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the operation spring 2001 associated with groups of moteros, although it had not adjusted the criminal code, were arrested 131 people.
Later, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the law on the gangsterism.

The areas north of the river and in the valley of the outaouais were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
Given that these were in addition to the melting of the snow that had already been accumulated in certain sectors, there are fears that various rivers flood.

They blame in part to Dupont
The author of radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Council of the rules of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (ccnr) by a controversial statements in relation to social assistance and on Haitians, as well as by his rude language on the radio.
The ccnr believes that Mr Dupont and his team of 98,1 FM Choi had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements were "inaccurate information on social assistance, a representation of Haitians and unduly negative rude language should not be used in programmes broadcast during the day."
The Council has also said that the discussions about suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had been suicide, does not violate codes on broadcasting.
The ccnr had received several complaints about the comments made in programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision came after a complaint from the united front of people receiving social assistance of Quebec.
The Group complained that the funds mentioned in the programme were not correct.
The hosts must communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In connection with the suicide, presented Stéphane Dupont had indicated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the message was that it should not be considered suicide as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the committee believes that the episodes called into question" Dupont Le Midi "have been a sensitive issue in a way that is fair and appropriate."
Therefore, in this regard has been scrapped any blame.
The latest dispute was about the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
In that time, Stéphane Dupont and jean-rené dufort had not a media showdown that has provoked numerous reactions.
The author Choi said that had not been any donation to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if people would receive the money.
The committee considers that these comments are excessive, but their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already done my suspension of three days up there."
"My record is clean for a year and a half," said the author.
In all the decisions, the committee denounced the emission of rude language.
In any case, the radio station choi-fm cooperated "even more than what is required."
The consequences will be insignificant to the station, which will, among other things, to announce the decisions once in the hours of greater hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The montrealés of Algerian origin nacereddine zemmal journey has had an extremely peculiar.
The athlete, who stands out in "kung-fu" full sanda "minimum"), kickboxing and and Thai box, climbs to the tatamis and rings in the world in search of new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts as the kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 in order to move forward on a professional level.
"in my case, I am looking for fighting everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground in the mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the company UPS, has recently been given bad news to their rivals, winning two gold medals at the world championship of the world amateur karate and kickboxing Association (wka), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of Thai kickboxing and full minimum box," he explained.
"Today I prepare to participate in the World Cup of San shou in China."
"They are the athletes who have ended up among the first four posts in the last World Cup in each category."
"In 2009, I earned the bronze medal in Toronto."
"in 2005, in Vietnam, closed in eighth place."
"in 2007, in China, finalicé the tournament in fifth place, but reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What is interesting is that I have moved forward in every competition."
"with this step, I would be the first this time or next year!"
The "San shou" or "sanda" is an original discipline of China in which it can strike with fists and feet, as well as launching opponents to the ground.
The clashes was originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The pugilista more famous in this kind of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin cung Le, widely recognised in the world of martial arts.
Although born zemmal just must maintain a race in his career, no doubt will come to the great tournament "king of sanda," the super bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious of China," explains the likeable boy.
"This is like the equivalent to the stadium lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight in the semi-finals of their category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"I have won a real professional," says.
"There are four competitors by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"the winners of the semi-finals they face at the end of their category."
"then, the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the King of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-québec has granted direct contracts with a value of $450 million for the engineering companies eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert hydroelectric project.
In the centre of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of companies bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor, that was achieved without a tender after the contract more important, the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision of private sector hydro-québec of entrusting the responsibility of managing this important hydro-electric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the gérance énergie consortium won the lucrative contract without that was previously a public tender.
For the party quebequense, recourse to groups of companies raises a serious ethical issue that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminate the competition.
"that is, the people, instead of doing so in secret, now do it openly," said yesterday the Member of the Party quebequense Sylvain simard at a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, Mr simard raised the issue in the National Assembly, because, he says, does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of natural resources, Nathalie normandeau, responded by the afternoon, denying that there has been collusion with this contract.
"I am beginning to think," objected, arguing that the PQ had acted so "dishonest" and "lack rigour."
He pointed out that "the least" would be that the PQ apologised.
The formula of the trusts is a common practice in the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit which allows two or more companies to bring their expertise to respond to a call to a complex project.
The project eastmain has a high level of complexity, bearing in mind the scale of the works.
Work has already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition that come into play; this was a negotiation.
Furthermore, the formula of the consortia has ceased to be the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for projects relatively straightforward.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, the formula of pools in the area of technical advice is being subjected to an investigation into the government.
A quick glance to the commercial register of Quebec can identify more than 200 pools, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors, such as top +, génivar, snc-lavalin, Roche et tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the consortium énergie gérance normandeau, the Minister stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a dynamic of labour and hydro-québec respond specifically to it from the years 1970."
The great head of the project, réal eastmain laporte, the Société d 'énergie of Baie James (sebj), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the contract has been awarded the project management directly.
"If respondes for a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can come into contact with the players in the sector and say: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"however, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the power of the people," said Mr laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium énergie gérance form part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the party quebequense.
The contracts were awarded by hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
After checking, Le Devoir has identified 109 contracts of technical advice awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotécnicos laboratories.
Snc-lavalin has won 22 contracts, génivar managed 16, 14 and 10 tecsult Dessau, without taking into account their participation in énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In total, amount to 449.783.344 dollars, including the énergie contract gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain simard has hinted that the four companies that form the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister normandeau has showered the PQ is also linked to these companies, "funded," before noting that it is more of their leaders.
A barometer of the responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply sceptical.
The consumer quebequense is little confidence in the players of sustainable development, as well as in fair trade marks or ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a universe where added media messages that argue for a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even held back its commitment.
Even if it has increased the use of the so-called "socially responsible" products in 2010, the natives of Quebec should seem to have very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, they do not trust the environmental commitment of the business or in advertising environmentalists, reveals the measurement tool developed by the centre of the responsible consumption of the University of sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers casts doubt on the reliability of the official certificates that carry products so-called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands that have labels indicating that are "ecorresponsables," says the barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the natives of Quebec should take seriously the speeches of the politicians on this issue.
In any case, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulating this sector of consumption, fuelled today by nearly a third of the natives of Quebec should consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious nature of the information make a 46% of consumers scrap this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, a third of the natives of Quebec should say beware too of the supposed benefits of organic products or services that are trying to sell.
Moreover, almost half of consumers have changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to follow his convictions.
A 61% has given priority to purchases in shops in his neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in the region, says the barometer.
More green and responsible (the rate of the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of 100 this year), Homo consumus of Quebec loves to get the job of the King of recycling that seeks to reduce its impact on the environment for the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the barometer, this social conscience seems to be of doors (her car) outside: in 2010, just 28% of the natives of Quebec should indicated that use public transport or have shared car to defend its principles environmentalists.
In addition, the 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive survey of behaviour, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of cycling and walking.
A loan for the state to get excentris
The government of Quebec, which have been asked to commit financially in the recovery of the complex of cinemas excentris pursuit the Société Angus and the parallèle, accepts work, but only through a loan.
The Société de Développement Angus and the parallèle expecting a donation of seven billion dollars in the Ministry of Culture to to buy back to Daniel langlois cinema complex on the Boulevard excentris saint-laurent and restore his true vocation cinéfila, have not got everything they asked for.
The government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but in their own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government proposes a loan the amount would be, in fact, short of initial expectations, it could be a viable solution in favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring, a first action plan and an application of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The President of the Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles (sodec), François macerola, who leads the dossier of excentris, sent a proposal and an action plan to the Minister st-pierre.
He has issued a final report 10 days ago.
However, the sodec received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that it must be disposed of completely the possibility of a donation to the state.
Let us remember that the association of owners of cinemas and cinema complex in Quebec is opposed to a direct investment from the state to support the recovery of excentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance building projects, as it has done with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the industry are a considerable financial aid.
Daniel langlois, owner of the same, has been for ten years the burden of copyright in their local cinema complex, after finance its own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Council of the Treasury.
The lack of rooms for independent films is made clear in Montreal and excentris had managed to entice their customers.
The company Angus and the parallèle, led by Christian yaccarini, drive for its part of a campaign of private funding, waiting to meet 700 dollars to get its way towards the purchase.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the parallèle, still casts films in excentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27, projecting the precious film of Xavier beauvois "des hommes et des dieux '.
However, Christian yaccarini has not been in contact with Le Devoir and we do not know what they think he and his group of proposals which have been falling.
Lifts the veil of Canada acomplejado...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States see as the complex of Canadians with regard to the Americans, but reflect both the feeling of superiority of recent towards Canada.
The American diplomats are shocked that Canadian voters do not think in relations canadá-estados us when they go to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to get it approved its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the United States Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offering rather juicy details that content really substantial.
A cable on 22 September 2008, i.e. during federal election campaign, described the extent to which the United States are not in the issues discussed by the political leadership.
This caused great surprise to us Ambassador David wilkins sent to Ottawa.
Mr wilkins offers some explanation of this situation.
"perhaps the political leaders are constrained by an inferiority complex almost inherent to the Canadians to try daily domestic issues, rather than allow this election to the United States (and during the campaign on the free trade in 1988)," writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The Ambassador has more problems in understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
"of course, is the ability of a candidate, party and, even more, the head of a party to run these essential relations should be a key factor in which should think the electorate to vote."
You can observe this sense of importance the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry breese, who is in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare to President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"her trip will help to ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, through which Canada will for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan for between $30 and $40 billion," writes Mr breese.
No mention is made that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that would replace the coalition and the opposition parties condicionaban their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication of January 2008 signed by Ambassador wilkins warning to Washington about the increasingly negative image conveyed by the CBC drama series broadcast in the United States.
The Ambassador is worried the emission of border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, where heavy-handed references are made to Maher Arar, "no-fly-list" or even to kidnappings to make vigorous CIA interrogation.
Another cable account that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be prepared to accept some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner said that yes, but that depended "in every case."
At the end of the meeting, wrote "has handed a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the case."
Finally, we can mention that have warmed, the mood on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said in the CBC radio that the responsible for this massive should be "shot."
In the United States of Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew the lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a renewal plan of the industrial, commercial and domestic lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in an amount that is almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be carried out to stabilise the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan falls in the range of major projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments of reduction in industrialised countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolise between 50 and 70% of the market, it sustituyesen with fluocompactas or, even better, by light bulbs electroluminescentes diodes (or "led" in English), we would prevent much of the 1.8 million tonnes (GT) of GHGs issued on the planet to enlighten humans.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent to 70% of global emissions of the cars.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the largest emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are committed to a voluntary reduction plans to reduce global emissions of GHGs from 53 GT to 49 GT.
However, should be lessened even 5 GT of that amount to stabilise before 2020, the increase in temperature by two degrees Celsius to avoid to get out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy in the form of heat and dispose of the remaining 5%, producing light.
In the case of the fluocompactas light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new bulbs LEDs, is still two times more energy consumption.
The bulbs fluocompactas last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new led light bulbs, such as those that has launched the manufacturer Philips this week (a company which, moreover, has been involved in the study of the UN), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which enables us to have an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the substitution plan that would apply in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reóstatos and emit very little heat.
Above all, do not contain mercury.
Various experts have expressed their reservations, because fluocompactas bulbs containing mercury and which should be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that manufacturers affix instructions.
However, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions in the world are not fluocompactas bulbs, but thermal coal, which emits huge quantities of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury each year.
The report details the advantages of this international programme in each country.
For example, Indonesia would be saved in this way a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 - equivalent to 3.5 thermal power stations which would cost EUR 2.5 million.
Ivory Coast anxiously awaiting the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for "immediate" the publication of the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, given that have expired deadlines.
"The Secretary-General highlighted the need for the Independent Electoral Commission completes its work and announce the interim results immediately," highlights a spokesman of the head of the UN.
'calls on all parties in Ivory Coast and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative to be announced until the interim results. "
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has made the deadline of Wednesday at midnight without being released the results three days since the election on Sunday.
Around 40 minutes before the end of the term, the President of the Commonwealth had said on television that the Commission was still "working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, have multiplied in the world the requests that the CIS finally declared the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo, and Alassane Ouattara his opponent.
However, the side of Gbagbo account with the annulment by the Constitutional Council votes "fraudulent" in the North, in the hands of the ex-rebellion forces new (National Front) from the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal affi n 'guessan, director of the campaign, the President of Ivory Coast, has said that the manoeuvres of intimidation of voters conducted for the National Front in the north of the country had discouraged the followers of the outgoing President of voting.
Throughout the election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts complaints lodged by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of Gbagbo believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as he is led by Paul Yao N 'dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man in the north that belies any relationship with the former rebels, has tried to "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and has asked Gbagbo which respects, but has not gone so far as to claim the victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and to submit a complaint to the Constitutional Council having prevented the Electoral Commission the dissemination of the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations has warned Wednesday to the political class of Ivory Coast that could be liable for any acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended up in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes compared to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received the support of the former President, Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and has announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM including) in October, after a 9.9% in September.
Alexandre guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre guérini, 53, steering companies of waste treatment and brother of President PS General Council Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of luynes, near aix-en-provence, in the framework of research on public contracts allegedly fraudulent.
Alexandre guérini is being investigated for misuse of social goods, embezzlement and corruption to public goods, cover-up, active, insider dealing and possession of ammunition, as indicated by his lawyer.
"Alexander guérini will fight and answering all questions put to you the magistrate, no ghosts."
"It is easy to perseguirle by a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to demonstrate this," he told the AFP his lawyer, Florence rault, before the hearing his client.
Mr guérini, brother of the leader of the Socialist Party in the department, jean-noël guérini, has wanted to convey through their lawyers to the judge before his hearing, a document to be explained.
Wednesday night also began to investigate and jailed one of its people close, Philippe rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr lucien Simon, the only thing that has made his client has been dealing with the waste that must be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the fate of the funds relating to their implementation, we know nothing about it, says Mr Simon.
In the framework of this dossier, is being investigated on Wednesday Daniel pinna, former Director General of the services of urban agglomeration of aubagne, misappropriation of funds and complicity, but I have made on parole and he is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all of the facts that have reproached."
"the investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and has been released," said his lawyer, Mr Yann arnoux.
On Tuesday evening to Wednesday was to four others and left the freedom, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel raffin.
Michel karabadjakian, deputy director general of the ownership of Marseille Provence métropole (mpm), has been accused of "passive and active corruption."
Two officials of agglomeration of aubagne, Michèle duval and Christophe bringuier, have been questioned by "theft and misuse of public goods by someone devoted to public service" and "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds," respectively.
Finally, the companion of Alexandre guérini, jeannie peretti, is being investigated for "cover-up of the misuse of social goods."
Among people who have faced the Mr guérini says Stéphane brunengo-girard, jailed recently in a parallel case involving fraudulent procurement to Corsica.
The researchers suspect that their societies have service to launder capital of major crime.
The research is being carried out in the framework of various instructions proceedings initiated against X in April 2009 after receiving anonymous communications, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, especially in the area of waste.
A source close to the investigation says that research is concentrated particularly in the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in the ciotat, that collects the waste of aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (mpm).
Matter Clotilde Reiss: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying," has been in thrall to the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has deepened the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of diplomats from the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
Painting the Élysée Palace has explained its strategy for the Americans to advise them to manage their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was in exchange for the release of Majid kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by US justice trafficking of materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, show the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostage taking."
The Élysée advisor for strategic affairs, François richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d " orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice paoli, conversan with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone.
He explained the French method.
Advising Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens detained in force in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "soltad continuously" in the media, the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of his image.
"When you ask Iranians paréis, hacedlo more often still."
Because, having exhausted the negotiating attempts by channels discreet, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "delaying tactics."
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreign nationals is "an Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
Announcing the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, day was hiding at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230 euros of reward).
In addition, points out that the Élysée Palace foreshadows other hostage crisis, a phenomenon that "will increase."
The Iranians could "in the near future to stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss goes to prison after 12 days, but it is blocked in Iran.
Spreads the following information: the Iranian kakavand Majid, whose extradition request to the United States for illicit traffic in a sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by the decision of a judge.
The US embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, that some Iranian clandestine networks of procurement for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid khakavand is bad news.
How has accepted France an exchange?
Does Iran released in exchange for the French?
For a new conversation with Kathleen allegrone, on 4 September, François richier ensures that was not the case.
The Élysée Palace, he says, not only "has been surprised by the decision of the judge," but has tried to oppose it.
"There has been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot overturn the decision," he says.
Mr richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid kakavand remains under "close" French intelligence services.
The Élysée adviser mark a telephone number, hanging and, later, reports in the US that the Iranian diplomat, "is currently in Paris buildings operated by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Élysée Palace has spared no efforts, uses press releases and "leakage" organised by the media to do believe that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is a "very important" and "influential" of "mediator."
Americans are watching this activity with some irony and check that the manipulation brings its fruits, as several newspaper articles from the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "'blitz' media French officials."
What must such "thanks" towards Mr Assad, we question the embassy in Paris.
"in spite of their declarations of praise, French officials privately admit that only have a vague idea of what they have actually done the Syrians'.
Then, the document is the reasons that have led to the Élysée Palace to produce this fiction.
The great effort "aims to strengthen the policy of Sarkozy of opening to Syria," he says.
A policy that began in 2008, which "in the view of many voices criticism in France and abroad, had just been branded desmerecida and premature."
The "exaggerate the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise they can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal also is to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US embassy knows of good source.
On 11 August, François richier it: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, is what we have."
"at least, this should lead to confusion between the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May of 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives in the Élysée Palace.
In a statement, thanks to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syrian played "an active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
From midnight, the young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers participating in online games after the midnight blocking their access, according to government officials have said.
In December, will have a draft law to Parliament to ask companies online games that block access to these Games after midnight to young people of less than 16 years, according to said representatives from the Ministries of culture and family.
"many children play all night and, later, it is difficult to study in school and to lead a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is needed to protect their health and their right to dream," declared the AFP Jo Rhine ministerial, head of the draft law.
The online games will be available again at six in the morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, said.
The government is also asking companies to limit the time daily access to these Games when the parents of young people request, added the officer.
In addition, will make available to anyone who requests it free computer programs that enable time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the countries most "connected" and the newspapers are regularly news on a number of events linked to a heavy use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world events online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the world cyber games, where he faced other 58 countries.
2018-2022: FIFA world on the host nations
In the middle of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of FIFA describes Thursday to the host nations of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a clear policy where the struggles of the lobbying and influence may take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the edition of 2018 FIFA competition in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, españa-portugal and countries bajos-bélgica).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation expects to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere in the African continent in 2010, or continue with its introduction in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of people who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Heads of Government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
The transactions in the background, it is therefore possible that will last until the last minute.
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of FIFA, the nominations (2018) English, Spanish and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight to the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of their country, home of football, which only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by a documentary that has confounded three influential Members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou.
Enough to upsetting FIFA and shame those responsible English, that have embarked on an intensive lobbying in recent weeks, with David Cameron to the head.
The head of government hopes re-run the coup with success by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had succeeded in 2005 to London the organisation of the jj.oo. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to restore the luster of England before the EC?
It is not clear, given that the duo españa-portugal account also with many strengths thanks to their stadiums, ready to go, his experience (world of 82 in Spain, jj.oo in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its culture of football.
However, the gloomy economic outlook and finance from both countries could tear down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal is done to Russia, which became an outsider in weight despite the gaps in his candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote," in a direct reference to the allegations of the English press against members of the EC.
"They are drawing up their skeletons, trying to involve them pro-actively," said Putin.
By 2022, the United States, which have the experience of 1994, seem to be the favorites more logical.
The first global economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidates seem premature to two countries that have organised together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of world 2026 to China, fervently sought by FIFA, which would result in Asia were possibilities for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has submitted its plan in stadiums futuristic, and Australia, FIFA desire with its expansion into new horizons, but both countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of the rights of TV paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war to FIFA.
Second term: proof
De Gaulle had hesitated.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac took not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less.
A mandate in the Élysée Palace leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this not combine well with the mystery that is generally associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, there is always that appear to question.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, but is not living, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that not ruling out a third term.
On 15 November, in tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would take its decision "some time in the autumn of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that comes with the members of the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Élysée Palace, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a stir.
Would this be the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President just indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 restricted to two the number of terms of five years.
Simply sent the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that speaks of the presidential elections, with a humorous note, at meetings of this kind.
"in the worst, or better still, of the cases, pasaréis seven and a half years with me," had to in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "No penséis that I wonder what comes after."
Their statements the day before he not closer to the nomination, not less.
Raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the fore leading to Nicolas Sarkozy in sincerarse.
Quite the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads to many people the PS claim that organised the battle ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, the right-wing voters prefer the nomination of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% compared to 44%, according to bva-l 'express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," reacted immediately and the area around the Prime Minister.
"if it thinks it can lose, it will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"always think they can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned before the evidence.
The euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of state bills
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year, should enable us to specify the methods of exit from the crisis, or at least, to announce the shutdown of a large number of operations unconventional monetary policy should be concluded by the end of the year.
Because of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the Institute of emission of Frankfurt certainly cannot afford to be so imperative if he does not want to risk having to aggravate a situation more difficult today in the European bond markets.
The political cost could be as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has backed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the solution to the debt crisis of the European States.
Not to say if he considered that the Central Bank should do more, rising by example its programme of buying government bonds.
"I reserve my opinion to my fellow Europeans'...
The eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was more eloquently about their intentions, stating only that the program of letters of the state in the secondary market "remained" and that "we will see what we decided" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the purchase of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled in the past week to about 1.35 billion euros.
In addition, according to the indiscretos market operators, yesterday would have bought again Irish titles and a Portuguese.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities totalling approximately 67,000 million euros from May 2010.
Between market operators, not the slightest doubt that the purchases (consult page 29).
Economists do not anticipate any significant changes of direction.
Although lending operations to more than three months have already gone from the arsenal of the ECB, it still makes unlimited amounts of liquidity to conditions beneficial and with that vary between one and three months.
Economists expect that today we extended this system for some months.
"I do not imagine that will significantly change their programme."
"If not, would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Commerzbank economist Michael schubert,.
"It seems more likely that there will be a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," Norbert bräms anticipates by his side, an economist in salt.
Oppenheim.
In connection with the interventions in the market of public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of those obligations to which the market remains stable," Norbert bräms.
Bearing in mind the importance of the exhibitions of European banks to the markets of sovereign debt in the euro zone, the Institute of emission has no choice but to maintain their presence in the market.
"It should compensate any price the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent a sharp rise in yields subscribers for the most fragile states," he thought yesterday an important manager of obligations.
Because, if interest rates are soaring, the States will have even more problems for reducing its debt, or even to stabilizing.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi weathers the Storm
After Italy has begun the week of a worryingly, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the decline of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of calm.
The departure of a meeting with the Minister of economy, the regional Presidents have said that listened to Giulio Tremonti described the situation as "unfathomable" and that it expected a weekend "unpredictable," statements contradicted later by the individual.
In any event, on Tuesday the difference with longer-term rates Germans had reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of contracts of hedging against the risk of default (crq) had rocketed to 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi said that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates by 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" over "the turbulence in the markets" and by contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, the problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the revenue associated with the same, which means that the state is at risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have dealt a heavy blow to the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget that is being considered in the Senate is based on figures from 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the suggestion that can be implemented new budgetary arrangements after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, should there be" austerity measures, the Economic Affairs Commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for some time," says arrigo sadun, the Italian manager in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, in either the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011], the efforts of stabilisation requested to Italy are lower than those required to other countries," says Pier Carlo padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Is the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which they could anticipate the elections at the end of March.
In that case, it will open a period that is scarcely likely to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
The Europeans are thinking about strengthening the mechanisms for combating the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already said yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already shown on Sunday night and by the day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defence of its currency and its currency zone."
Although he was on, the easing seen yesterday in the rates of the obligations of the European States has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we must not to refer to the principle of standardisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor 's announced that could lower the rating of Portugal, the target more often at the moment of speculation.
"like in May, really lack clarity and transparency policies, which weighs significantly on banking systems," believe economists from exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the pace is far slower than the pace of markets."
Aware of this gap and the dangers that hides, European countries are stepping up the discussions to strengthen the mechanisms of exit from the crisis already exist.
The informal consultations between the ministers of finance that are most directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts from the G-20 are on track.
And this also bearing in mind the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the order of the day, the kind of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro zone in the colimador of markets (consult above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, started on Tuesday in Singapore, a route from Asia to inform investors of the Far East on aspects of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, certainly preparing the ground.
It predicted that the initial emissions of titles of the EFSF is made next month.
Yesterday, a US official representative has entrusted to Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase of the funds mobilised by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
As for the countries that are first in line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to the austerity measures with an effect closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move in a different way to that followed, Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs to seek international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and the structural reforms that they consider essential to increase the confidence.
The European funds, finally, there are questions about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the markets of public duties.
Passing through Paris, November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750 million in Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to draw the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the market of the European public debt, consider that an amount of around EUR 100 million extra would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, currently provided with EUR 60 billion.
A Council that, undoubtedly, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on Orange alert
The snowfall continue to cause difficulties for a movement, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments on Orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice training.
Eure, eure-et-loir, Les Deux-Sèvres Vienne and have added to the two departments that were already on alert Orange, 18 from Wednesday for the day and two, dordogne and Gironde, joined the Group for the night.
According to France météo, the heavy snow falls affect North of Gironde and Charente, but also snow slightly in island of France.
We expect a few layers of snow of between 2 and 5 cm, promptly of between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and of between 1 and 3 cm, or even to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, as well as Charente-Maritime, côtes d 'armor, yield, Gironde, Poitou, and the dordogne region of Lower Normandy, island of France and lemosín.
The snowfall are strong enough to cause difficulties of movement and affect some economic activities, alert météo France.
In the côtes d 'armor, has banned access to several roads departmental on heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including axes guingamp-lannion and saint-brieuc-loudéac.
According to the gendarmes, the movement in the secondary network of Britain is complicated and recommend not lead except in case of need and has banned the movement of certain vehicles) during the day.
During the Thursday, has been banned school transport in Picardy.
There was no provision for any specific measures on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The Prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate General of civil aviation (dgac) asked the airlines to anulasen Thursday 25% of its flights at the airport in Paris Roissy and 10% in orly because of the snowfall.
The dgac recommends to air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
The grand Paris metro financial early drafts.
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, rains billions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we speak of the 23 million for the metro, the grand Paris that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
So the GSP, the state has announced a fund of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this sum that will allow then to the GSP borrowing in the markets to fund a portion of their double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The finance bill letter from 2010, examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains provisions intended to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase in the tax on the offices on the island of France.
The first, according to read in Article 15 of the text of the draft law, is "in the interests of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
In addition, is set in numbers: "the product of this tax is of 117 million euros a year."
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernise it, increasing its product and use the increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would be achieved with this method?
Who knows.
In the text does not give figures.
But it is far from 4 million.
"It requires that the fiscal resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds which will mobilise the state and to be awarded to the Société du Grand Paris as the project advances," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP not surprised this system.
"when we created (the two income tax], we can cover the studies for three years and then get the 4 million later, as we explained."
"There will be in the budget and will be used as needed."
The GSP estimated that empecerá to receive the 4 million in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This arrangement, in which the 4 million promised not to appear in the credit, can lead to a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Hackers public and spies diligent
The issue has a dual WikiLeaks.
On the one hand, reveals a scandal apparent, a scandal that only seems scandal to the hypocrisy governing relations between the States, the people and the press.
On the other hand, raises profound changes at international level and provides for a future dominated by the recession.
But to go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each case created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to the belonging) is made up exclusively of press cuttings.
The "extraordinary" revelations Americans on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only reflect what has been writing for months in any newspaper (except those from Berlusconi) and the profile siniestramente ridiculizador of Khadafi has long offering ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule whereby the secret files just must be trained by news public knowledge is essential to the dynamic of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to publications esoteric, you will see that each work repeated (on the grail, the mystery, the rennes-le-château templarios or the rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not solely to the authors of ocultistas texts do not want to make investigations novel (or does not know where to look for an update on the non-existent), but because those involved in the unaccountability not just rely on what you know, what reconfirmed what had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret files.
The informer is lazy, as is lazy (or has little desire) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, whatever, editor of the Libération), which only considers what can recognise.
The top secret information on Berlusconi, who has sent the US Embassy in Rome at the State Department was the same that Newsweek published the previous week.
Why then have caused such a stir the revelations of these cases?
On the one hand, only saying what everyone farmed already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the Second World War and the Heads of States can be called by phone or to take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost his diplomatic role and, with the exception of some exercises limited representation, have become centres of espionage.
Any viewer watching films of research knows very well, just aparentamos that we do not know for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact repeat publicly infringes the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker anyone can consult the secrets more secrets of the most powerful country in the world affects considerably the reputation of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal is affecting both the victims and the "butchers."
But in the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in the era of Orwell, could be designed to power as a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has become reality in which, thanks to the phone to check every movement, every transaction conducted, hotel visited, motorway taken, the citizen is broken in this way in a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when, as happens now, even the criptas of the secrets of power cannot escape the clutches of a hacker, the relationship of control is one-way and becomes circular.
The power controls to every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the vengeful of the people) can access all the secrets of power.
How can aguantarse a power that can no longer or keep their own secrets?
It is true, as you said Georg simmel, that a real secret is a secret empty (and a secret gap can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is in reality a secret vacuum, without secrecy, as is from the public sphere; but, as he did disclose WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton be secret empty means removing any power.
Wikileaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but yes, and Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused by a power so powerful?
It is clear that, in future, the Member States can no longer put in the network any classified information, as that would be as publish it on a poster in the street.
But it is also clear that, with the current technologies, we cannot expect to keep confidential talks by telephone.
Nothing is easier to find out if and when a Head of State has shifted and it has been in contact with one of the peers.
How can keep in the future relations private and confidential?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my forecast is something out of science fiction and, therefore, novelesca, but I imagine to government agents that move discreetly in stagecoach with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at best, hiding some data written on the heels of her shoes.
This information is preserved in a single copy, in locked cabinets: after all, the attempted espionage of Watergate had less success that WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now running as a crab, that is to say, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionised communications, the Internet has become to create a Telegraph with cables (phone).
The video tapes (analogue) had allowed the researchers to film a movie step by step, progress and retreating, discovering all the secrets of the Assembly, while now CDS (digital) may move forward or backwards from chapter to chapter, that is, massive proportions.
With high speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while flying, with movements that entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, there is nothing outside of the normal that the policies and techniques of communication they take us back to the cars of horses.
One last comment.
Formerly, the press was trying to understand what is within India, plotting in secret in the embassies.
At present, there are embassies which call for confidential information to the press.
Climate: the gaffes of France in their promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to examine whether they have kept the promises of funding quickly unlocked (so-called fast start or early) made by the developed countries.
And they have revealed the French messes.
In the Copenhagen agreement, the developed countries undertook to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to contributing EUR 7.2 million in three years and France earmarked million euros (420 million a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to funding fast start is real: a report detailing the measures its Member States, a press conference, a major event, the distribution of leaflets...
The operation transparency worthwhile result and was appreciated for what it is actually: developing countries and civil society have all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU says it has released 2010 EUR 2.2 billion, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of 7.2 million in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that we make an additional effort, without prejudice to the official development assistance.
Unfortunately, it has not come to an agreement on what it means to "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed a harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken in the year 2009: the international funding and add 150 million in three years in concept of financing fast start.
Other countries have similar references in the year or at the level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the cost of previous years and the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of aid France to developing countries can remain stable (or even reduce), while claims that respects its commitment in terms of 'new and additional ..."
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and each country chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowing amounts to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is untrue, presenting a euro which is going to recover as equivalent to a euro that donated... as much, so only their commitments should be charged for the cost of the loan to the country that gives the loan (that is, the equivalent to an interest rate).
But France is not useful, "respects" their commitment of EUR 420 million doing a 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and a 8.5% of donations (36.1 billion euros); consult the document of the EU to see it in their own eyes.
This is the only country of the Union which uses so frequently the loan.
Germany uses it in a 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, keep to their commitments with a 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France just brings ten cents and believes that the effort is comparable.
A neat trick!
In short, in its financing fast start, France made a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the action at the time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, manages to give the impression that spends 420 million extra and "new," as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that is bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States to continue donating when they can simply pay?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The bulk of the funding early is peanuts, relatively short term, in relation to the whole of the negotiations on the climate.
But it may be a bit more in the vast machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this does not happen.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn of this first year of funding available.
Firstly, France could announce a change in the method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way that the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could make moving the debates about the stakes in relation to the funding in the long term (another crucial area, which is currently under discussion): We do not get rid of the issue of "additional" or the method for measuring lending.
France could change its stance to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
Therefore, we have the hope the new environment minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and on its vision of "additional" and the use of the loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to make progress in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years consumed in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Association générations futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, warning that its results "did not have a significant statistical value given the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problems raised," bought in supermarkets in oise and Paris between July and September the food that they eat a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, who observed the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day), as well as sweets, were analysed in laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic safe, as well as 37 to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies of various institutions like the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"although, in almost all cases, are not exceeded legal limits for each of the chemicals alone, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or EP is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain alone more than a dozen possible carcinogenic waste and three carcinogenic deemed safe, as well as nearly a score of waste that can harm the hormone system.
The bone, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the College, contains traces of six chemicals, including fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to beans from Kenya, including in the food, in which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, the canned tuna and even the loaf of bread or chewing gum were aderezados with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis found the presence of nitrates and cloroformo.
At the dinner, the slice of salmon was the most "nutritional" with 34 chemical waste identified and even the analysis of the plate of plastic used for heating food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that generate these "cocktails" of pollutants to the consumer "is probably underestimates," says the study.
The Alliance Europe ecología-les Verts (ee-lv), for its part, has proposed "owing to the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases linked to civilisation."
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 pesticides different identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
