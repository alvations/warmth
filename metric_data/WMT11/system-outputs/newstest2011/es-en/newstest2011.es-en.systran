What is? The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort and pastry shop
The new councillors of ČSSD in the capital are going to have to overcome it seems clear the linguistic barriers so that the components of the Meeting in Prague and the city Council to understand his new colleagues from the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period "language considered" the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check his knowledge of the sharp language that has emerged over the Council in the past, when the current members of the coalition government Prague.
Encrypted dictionary that used the flower and political cream from Prague during the previous period, mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the characters and situations and causes best-known the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been noted that the new councillors almost do not understand those familiar concepts.
At least, so they say.
." Who is Voldemort"
"I really do not know."
"Rather, I am a novice in the praguense policy," said during the examination of terminology of "colegueo" councillor for culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And with regard to political veteran, equal Karel Březina reacted.
Perhaps they know the "hole in golf."
"It is the only word that you asked me to use from time to time."
"If any, usually not use jargon."
The glossary, whose definitions last published Aktuálně.cz newspaper June before the us congress vote on the ODS, chose six examples, especially those that are particularly concerning municipal authorities in Prague.
The Socialists had to explain concepts "Voldemort, "" greatest golf holes from Prague, to go to the pastry shop," "back of the throat of bull," "betrayal of capital" and "shield."
Three councillors agreed to be tested and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, that in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr, Dolínek refused to do so.
"I do not put in these things and i think to assess how the democrats fun" civic.
"What matters to me is how we will be in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
Since he has seen allegedly Kaucký councillor Lukáš would not have realised that the previous title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of exalcalde Roman Bém Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does nothing to him. the only word that was right in the review is "the biggest hole in golf for Prague."
"It is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, which adds immediately. "But I know it on the news."
"I am going to have to aim at a course of languages," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not one that recognizes the hole in golf the Blanka tunnel, but also the Environment councillor Plachý Lukáš.
Later, both sociodemócratas know who is really Lukáš Voldemort Plachý and even know where to find this nature. in addition, he suspects the meaning "to address the pastry shop."
"I think it means going to a company in Prague" and then wake up to Plachý that is the headquarters Janoušek companies.
As Březina indicates that such knowledge gained from the news, but that does not use such vocabulary.
According to participants in the trial, between sociodemócratas any such family glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but he really seems that we do not have anything similar."
"Rather, we used nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or match words with the names," says the president of the praguense, Petr ČSSD Hulínský, whose party friends call Hulda.
"In school Bříza they called me, but I do not know if my colleagues also call me so," he confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper put the name and work.
For his fellow party, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or fewer friends, Dědek ("old" representative, Miroslav Poche, with whom delusions were associated with the elections under the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname of "Igráček" ("playmobil" by some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that sociodemócratas tolerate the speech within the party.
To Hulínský does not like being called Hulda, but even Aktuálně.cz newspaper found other nicknames for this praguense president.
"The doctor right club" it seems that Petr recalls Hulínský obtained his doctorate in Law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "the witches," according to published in a booklet
The women as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They have an advanced age, can not work, for example, for health reasons, they are unmarried and do not have children.
Women who "become" witches are sent to an isolated area so that they do not harm other people.
"Men seldom but suffer it."
"It does not isolate the healthy young women because they help work and children," a nun explains in the State Capital of west Africa Burkina Faso deals in a special residence than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local Government has decided to oppose this unusual "social action."
It issued an information leaflet which should help avoid the witch-hunt.
However, this has a fly in the ointment.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso does not read" warns in writing the Standard newspaper Die on the drawbacks of awareness.
The witchcraft accusations are also common in other African countries.
Desire in neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, last week Hemmah died Ammy 72 years, when three women and two men tortured, filled with gasoline and burned it.
The news appeared on the bbc.
The authors claim that it was an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
According to this version, the woman trapped in the oned oil is used for ritual unctions.
One catch oned in flames when the group wanted to "remove the bad spirits" of women.
The isolation of "the witches" people from all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted an employer of 42 years of Burkina Faso. "The all-consuming of human souls always a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso Government tries to calm the witch-hunt, in Gambia last year was still the president.
"Gambian president Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a hunt for the witches who, presumably, had been linked to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him brought to shamans of around Guinea, protected by police, military and personal escorts of the president, took to force men and women selected randomly into the Gambian peoples ownership of Kanilai president," says in her report the organisation Amnesty International.
In the property, the arrested people had to drink a potion of grass with hallucinogenic effects that caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay in the property.
After international pressure, finally released around a thousand people arrested.
The tenants of Bakala. it heats up with coal stoves and strong a higher rent
The man, elderly and strong, crossed the center of attention to customer of company Byty RPG "tycoon of coal" Zdeňek Bakala, the biggest private owners of flats in income in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm it documented with new contracts for renting three flats. his, her daughter and her son, who is serving sentence.
The end to the pillaging of income.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns by a floor of two stays with separate kitchen second class.
"Furthermore, it does not have hot water and heating is based on a solid propellant kettle," shows the finger at the man in the new contract of his son, whose signature he has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains average angry, average resigned.
The civil partnership BytyOKD.cz, which described the new "incorrect and indecent" conditions of income, recommends the tenants who do not sign new contracts and that wait until the December 7, when it will publish a guide having informed how to proceed in these cases.
But before that, the man just a gesture.
"Everyone says a thing," he says with bad side.
Ostrava is becoming a major research laboratory of liberalisation.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of flats in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated income.
For that reason, Aktuálně.cz was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
Mining waiting room of RPG is one of four in Ostrava, and on Tuesday to nine, was already full.
Just next to the doors are security guards and his side a machine to take figure.
2011 "Rent" it can be read in a bright button of its touch screen.
When pushing it, leaving the machine a slip of paper with a number.
It almost does not give time to read "157" and the number is on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Shortly after, an elderly marriage to ask, but the crowd in the room is not in favour of the new leases.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past. applications for adjustments, similar issues of insurance and issues.
The letters with new contracts for rent will arrive in Ostrava at the mailboxes of the tenants of the majority of the 44,000 flats from RPG around the middle of November.
RPG Byty in letters proposes an increase in income between 15 and 38%.
18 Of November in the centre open a window of attention to customer for the new leases.
"It has been working this week, so it is starting," they respond, after hesitating briefly, workers who are in it when the client is presented as a journalist.
Liberalisation and former apartment for miners of Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the election, stop dealt with them and clear parliament's vice - president of original Lubomír Ostrava, Zaorálek, ČSSD, and now is in the papers over the area.
"Twenty years later, I want a new land."
"Either they changed the cursed plate of the bath," is relieved man mentioned in the introduction.
According to workers at the moment they are more than anything rejoiced to see if they receive a discount in rent if they sign in time, as it offers the special offer from RPG.
The remaining tenants will also receive half of the discount on the February income to sign a new contract before the 15 of December.
However, the window of the "mining liberalisation" certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they merely asked for rent in 2011 over forty or fifty people," believes the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG has proposed in the Web and its pieces to make individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two sides do not reach agreement on rent, it will have to resolve the issue an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way entirely possible, according to the law," warns RPG in their pages.
"This is not going to judge anyone," one of the staff of Byty RPG and a man in the street in the centre of attention the customer gives him at least partly the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and 5,000 for food. I do not have the means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee seeds of doubt.
"We will see."
"Mr Zaorálek warns them that they do not sign it, so people hope," thinks.
The lease will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to Byty RPG, the increase is an economic necessity.
"The current leases not even cover even the amounts for the maintenance of the heart of the community," he remembers Pavel Klimeš, director of residential portfolio company Byty RPG, which adds that neglected the bottom of the community that has upset the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the income.
Whereas during the five years passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with incomes to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the number will rise to 5,200 million.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlighted in red.
"The increase in income in 2011 to 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, more than 90% of the RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most 7.50 monthly Czech crowns per square metre," is shown on the screen.
Only 38% income of 400 flats of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from some extremely - low quantities of 19.66 kroner per square metre," says RPG.
In 2.600 flats, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect blow to rents, but it will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds this commitment. the company will invest any money from the rise of the lease (consults the chart) in the apartment, mostly in savings in the heating. new windows and heating.
People will have priority to sign the agreement of income rise.
The architects have understood that the offices also need nursery
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
Nobody would say the same of these facilities also lies within a small nursery yet. coloured walls, creative furniture and even a miniature cars in the outdoor terrace.
Between October of last year, the children of employees of Arch.Design can go for it.
The company Arch.Design architectural projects, whose study they left many buildings known Brno, from the first sketches of the Avriopoint about including building a space for its miniday-care centre.
The company they work around 90 people, especially in the age of baby boomers and wanted to allow architects and draftsmen soon could return to work after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced timetable, the nursery is one of the benefits Arch.Design within the framework of its workers of their social agenda.
The builders and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a demanding career with childcare.
The miniday-care centre was an idea of the employees of Arch.Designu and, with the support of direction, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The miniday-care focus of the company as part funds through the European Social fund operational Programme of human resources and employment, as well as the state budget in the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (awarded a grant of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) could buy the team and, after two years, hire skilled staff and services.
When it impoverishes the funding (two years), the Arch.Design company has a duty to keep miniday-care the centre with its own funds for three years.
Preparations for the project lasted a year and in the presentation of the funding request it helped the Economy company Rating.
The children is in the hands of qualified personnel. in addition, a nurse and a professor in the Department of Education are present throughout the day for their care. The nursery today welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since this is a "miniday-care centre," it can only be welcome at the same time as a maximum of five children, even with the deals are more during the day.
The nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same rights to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an education and personal care, the contents of the programme of miniday-care centre are comparable to the programme of normal pre-school education.
In her children not only play, but they also receive a quality education. from basic training to prepare for college, they teach English.
The class has not only of table toys and games, but also a computer to children.
The presence of small children in their own company to create an amicable and positive atmosphere.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid stress to late pick up children from school when he is away from his workplace.
So, parents are more productive while they work.
It is not surprising that this creates naturally a loyalty between worker and employer.
In this way, Arch.Design between the companies sign that they offer a big advantage for the admission of new workers. they support the family and, really, this enhanced marketing staff.
The house is fascinating bone after 100 years. They see the interiors of Gaudí
The roof is the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and balconies seem the mouth of an open fish.
That is the Batlló home in Barcelona, the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of the way similar to a skeleton, locally dubbed it "the house of the bones."
Its organic forms, its eye-catching colours, the novel use of stone, the fragments and mosaics, a facade that reminds the grudges and the ubiquitous least curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the home playing with oníricas lines, delicate colours and textures from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, it is seen some geometry, and a carefully designed order.
At night, the whole facade of the house is even more impressive because it is lit in such a way that the gloss of colours improves.
It winds and the torsion of the ways is to us also striking in its internal affairs.
The wavy copies of the timber frames of the windows, the railings, the baubles of the doors, the peepholes and signs.
The Batlló House, which is in the Eixample district in 43 of the animated commercial street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the reshaping of a house of 1877 of architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The restructuring lasted two years and the home was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and starting from scratch, but he accepted the idea of Gaudí to make a new and cheaper restructuring.
However, the Batlló Home, consisting of various apartments, did not design it Antoni Gaudí.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated on the design.
Indeed, in their planes of the project decorations for the representative of flat owner of the property and mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other architects and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló Home was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol involved in the construction of the Milá housing and Güell parc de Gaudí, in which other bits of the same.
Due to their organic form, the premises shortly after its conclusion dubbed it "the house of the bones."
Others due to the specific mechanism opening windows began to call it "the house of the yawns."
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of St George, the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building from religious reasons.
Gaudí planned in the house a single system for time with central heating vents of ventilation and the typical chimneys.
His inclination wonder from forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí absolutely did not respect the rules of the time and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the building obtained the relevant permission from the beginning, although obviously in the data indicated on the planned restructuring were so vague that, two years later, to its conclusion, the city council was hit so with the result that asked that it be corrected.
It bother you, for example, that even included columns to the public sidewalk.
The adjustments were never carried out, quite the contrary. just fifteen days after a request by the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and received) permission to both higher rental apartment in the building.
In the apartment below the owner.
In the gallery of the second floor was the hall and on the third floor of the dormitories and private side of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry shop.
The home of six flats, is completely crossed by stairs that lead up to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of reform was breaking all angles and airlines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting the area.
The common part can be connected completely open the doors of the rooms and a larger group can be transmitted in this way smoothly, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional flats.
It is astonishing how Gaudí also with the light plays, white and blue tiles covering the internal courtyard and skylights.
The game with two colours gives the maximum light throughout the apartment of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that target reflects more light than the dark colours, which instead absorbed sun rays.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, 2005 was added to the list of world heritage of humanity of UNESCO.
In the first phase of the house is the largest apartment and recharged of accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public at 2002, 150º anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With visits they confirmed, they discovered that is a very successful business and extended visits to the common area and the attic, including the terrace of the roof.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, reaches 16.50 Euros, while the students, pensioners and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably above the price of entry of other buildings of Gaudí in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of bed, his towers of lizard, my friend would have to be done swiftly of a resident of neighbouring homes and to visit him at home.
How one chooses the mattress and somier. men and women look for different things
None of a pompous framework for bed. what really makes his capacity as a good bed is the surface to ease up, namely the mattress and somier.
Firstly they must be complemented perfectly to adapt the individual users.
During the election elements come into play many, including weight, height, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is home where it is the mattress and somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not have, latex mattresses should not be used because "they are from warming by more slowly."
In addition, they weigh significantly more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them more often.
If the canals of the centre do not air and, briefly, they are on a firm footing, they retain moisture inside. It might even be mould underneath.
In choosing a bed, they also influence the customs.
He has spent a long time abroad, often she uses a huge cushion with a weak layer and will have to sit on a lower surface and lasts well.
"Almost all the hockey players who returned from the NHL complained that this did not sleep as well."
"For your meal shoulders, hips heels and they needed mattresses with a weak layer viscoelástica."
"This kind of mattresses is also recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so get bad information from the joints and skin," explains Hadamcziková Sylva, which specializes in the quilted furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, take time viscoelástica preferring the mattresses.
"Today there is no problem because they have the proper Italian Tempur and Magniflex, but also the Tropical Czech brand."
It is no longer necessary to be a player in the NHL to be able to see the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" is a very simple way.
He optimises their rigidity and it is based on the heat absorbed or suits their body heat.
Nothing pressure. during the night, it will not give back as after a divided hard.
It simply rest is better.
The viscoelástica also works as protection against sores.
In choosing the size of the mattress, adds to its height the length of their feet, i.e, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a rise of around 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width of a person would have to be in a double room, 90 cm, overall 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example, unmarried, recommended a minimum of between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule applies to calculate the width. when easing up, mouths must be comfortably timid hands to the elbows," he advises Prokopová engineer Helena, Cechu experts to dekoratérů čalouníků, which has already been many years dealing with the problem of healthy dream and the ergonomics of furniture, which teaches in specialist schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own somier and mattress, so for the purchase is necessary to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
On the contrary, it will be necessary to launch somieres to different heights, which is not always possible in all the beds.
The foam mattresses must have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with interior of docks a minimum of 15 cm, that at least three inch are for layer that suits the forms and smooths.
"When touching it with the hand or complying in the mattress, surely the docks would not have to release," warns Prokopová Helena.
Each mattress requires a kind of somier true.
Quilted fully dormitories, where the mattress and the base are like Siameses, do not make sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and its coverage can be washed, which today is often done.
And, as every night we transpire between 0.2 and 0.75 ls of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us a great (and congested) screening.
So the experts reject the slogans that talk about a life of mattress of up to 25 years or even a guarantee for life.
However, it has all but.
For that reason, the sellers give an advice: in the mattresses to a width of 120 or 140 cm, look carefully at cleaning and washing of coverage, but better year of a cushion that can be withdrawn and easily be washed.
Although currently covers of mattresses with rack closure in all its perimeter, so when they stay open in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine), its manipulation in the larger models (and for a single person) by building the mattress may seem a fight between a weight fly and a heavy burden.
In bed, instead of somier. it has a firm table?
Never!
As for the thought beds to spend an evening visits.
However, it must do (if you do not already) airing holes in the table and should be used as a mattress with docks in the interior and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (as Taschenfederkern German) and a weak layer.
The polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For somieres of articulables laminae and containing between 14 and 18, mattresses laminae of latex mattresses or can be used sandwich (for example, a latex combination and fibre of Coco), although it is always better to somier with more laminae, 28 or more, where laminae of the lumbar region they reinforce its rigidity and can be regulated.
Somieres of articulables laminae should not be used as a cushion of docks, since it does not react to the reclinación.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of laminae, the protection can also be used.
It is a special fixing laminae to press or even laminae to lean in such a way that they "wrap" perfectly shoulders during the dream.
For men who have some very broad shoulders, that is very important.
Manufacturers of mattresses even remember them that, in the "male," they began to use a softer area around shoulders.
They also remind women, who put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding clients, there are somieres with structure cross or small boards with so-called damping multitorsion.
The pressure is distributed among different points and tension stoops.
It must also consider that, while using the mattress and somier right, using a pillow (large and "fluffy"), most of the benefits will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should keep our heads and corners can only reach shoulders so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 xs 60 cm, quite normal for example in Scandinavia.
While easing up on the pillow should be at the same level (when reinforcement for the shoulders or the softest part of the mattress is combined with somier with) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to watch, it seems, stuffed with original straw mattresses.
Manufacturers are using more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, the organic mattresses are fashionable.
Raw materials with oil, which makes polyurethane foam, filled with natural oils, for example, castor bean or soya.
In fact, almost all well-known manufacturers use them.
"Organic, in the case of mattresses, it means that the centre is only natural materials origin, Petr Vašíček of Tropico company explains Plus.
Also, natural substances during the manufacture of the coverage of mattresses, one of the first aloe side are used.
But it can also be decided on microcapsules that release a fresh aroma of forest and lavender.
Differences between men and women there.
While the men "refresh" breeze with herbal extracts, so the cover of the mattress absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "warm up" the cover.
The extract of red pepper improves circulation of the blood, so that women are more warmth.
The favorites at the moment?
The cold foam mattresses that are more porous, with a suitable structure cells, making them more open than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelástica rigid foam makes mattresses to make various areas to know where it is the head, shoulders and heels.
A cushion of good quality will cost of seven thousand kronor for the top.
Those who plays a therapeutic role usually have a lower vat, because they are seen as average toilets.
The first that it achieved this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes the offers of the manufacturers or sellers can be approved, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the brand offers Magniflex mattresses Duofreeze with a foam with Memory memory stuck to the cover of 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of the viscoelástica with an open cell structure and density began with "cosmic" Tempur material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoffs praise astronauts they were under tremendous strain.
Tempur softens with the heat and becomes hardened with the cold.
So human, warm body, has a perfect effect and fits best pressure.
So it is ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve the comfort during sleep.
The viscoelástica foam is not only used mattresses, but also for medical devices, for example for pillows that fall under the legs and relieve them, as well as their movement.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use foam C or Eucatherm and similar Twinsaver.
More and more parents using tracking devices for people to control their children's
The fear of children is becoming more people to think about controlling for GPS.
The system, initially designed to monitor vehicles can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case like the disappearance of the girl of nine years Anička Janatková.
Currently the device has the rough size of a box of matches, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people gave fear the case of the missing Anička and they began to report on available resources to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We all try to tell us that it is not a spy, but another way to minimise the chances of a tragedy takes place," believes Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of monitoring devices to the Czech market.
"I recognise that in some cases it can be abused such devices, for example if they put in the wallet of someone without their knowledge, but we have not yet met with such cases."
"The majority of customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their view, the children would always have to know what is the small box and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child does not want to take it, he will just throw it.
"Even small children show great creativity in losing some things and if they want to avoid they control."
"Before, the parents trusted mobile phones, but these could be extinguished as easily as tracking device," says Bočková.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether in case of attack such device is really useful.
"If there is preparing a kidnapping, he will almost always see if the child is some sort of electronic device that can reveal its location."
"Now is the phone."
"It is expanding the use of tracking devices, will also seek them, as its sale will undoubtedly be done with much publicity."
"In such cases, criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised bomb a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Surveillance, which offers monitoring services for cars and people, even if, after an attack destroyed the monitoring device immediately, their presence can help.
"The device can be formed to regularly sends the position after a certain period."
"If it suffers damage, it will at least provide the final position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices take integrated an inclination measurer, so if the person just slips and falls immovable, the device will immediately issue a warning to the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, a service of this kind can even be achieved with smart mobile phones with navigation, where a special programs should only be.
The problem of tracking units is that it is currently devices with similar size to a box of matches or less mobile phones.
They can therefore be lost.
According to the Macro Pilin Weil, so evidence at the moment with devices are being made to seem a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor does not identify the device."
"Or that identifies it after some time, which can make the police gains," adds.
Although the tracking devices take on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used to monitor vehicles.
It is checking the position with a GPS system (which is used in standard navigation in the car) combined with the role of a mobile phone that informs the current position.
The army has enough wicks all like the Czech Republic. But only two years latest
The Czech army bought 445 miles from wick to catch explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence has added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of wick.
So they have existence for 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of wick two years, four.
The army bought the wick for explosives to STV Group. s. for forty million kronor.
The staff of the General said MF DNES to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of wick said that the soldiers need for training drill wick 60 miles a year.
According to calculations by the fireworks of the army, with which it made contact MF DNES, it is decided that, in this case, the generals, officials of the High Command would also have to make these manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives each year, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want free and defence Minister Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
It would only be justified that the army spends sixty kilometres of wick.
Such length is 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
IF, contrary, as the experts say, for training every new career comes with a maximum of two metres of wick, the army should have previously with the new purchase (even adding the use of special units engineers or) said enough existence for 225.
Soldiers from the brigade of rapid intervention recently complained personally before Minister Vondra because they say that as soon as ammunition for various weapons, so the practice of shot by about money are limited.
And we do not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I do not understand that they buy such amounts of wick repeatedly."
"But it is their decision, and certainly they will know why they do so."
"For us, the army is a good customer who, as a company, we try to satisfy," he admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of wick also said that it will have existence of this "ammunition" as a minimum for ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, STV Group, says that wick only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnical products for the army or the police of two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, by the criticisms of the army, do not want to give his name.
After the conclusion of his life, every weapons must be checked carefully to see if it remains reliable and does not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometres of wick, a discount.
"A 60% cost Us less than the last year of 244 miles," says spokesman Pejšek the shopping centre of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare. the annual consumption of wick of the fireworks of police, that removing munitions from World War II or the left by the Soviet army, it does not exceed for years the 1,500 metres.
In addition, the police always calls just the right amount of depleting ammunition in his life.
They decided that for security reasons for the fireworks, and meanwhile more modern and reliable types of wick can be achieved.
The Ministry already know clearly struggling to finish tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition of the Warsaw Pact, when the czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people were ready for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the fireworks that MF DNES, after a couple of years, the next problem with the current one will take place. it will be necessary to eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap."
Until now, living on the contacts that I achieved thanks to the contest
The fact to win the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the tax exemptions from their hotel.
The latest edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" employer of 28 years Lukáš Pytloun in Liberec.
Its success story is drawn from a film.
Pytloun to Lukáš is happy to travel.
Abroad, he realised that in Liberec there was a need to drive quality accommodation.
With the savings that gathered abroad with seasonal jobs and credit of the bank it bought a house that was destroyed half composed of five flats.
Given that still considered his third year at university, it was really brave.
"At present, the value for money of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
It began to rent restructured first phase of foreign workers.
All the revenue that it achieved more invested in the building, that gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, seven years in the business, it was gradually able to open in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants in style and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
Most comfortable of all it was, until recently, the design hotel, four Pytloun stars.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, we have sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a franchise of Pytloun," she told the employer number one last year.
"This sale of licences for the opening of the hotel largely helped to win the contest of "Entrepreneur of the year,"" he adds Pytloun appreciative.
The victory both increased its reputation and popularity in Liberec in the vicinity.
"People recognise me in the street, even congratulated me and often, I have to say that it was very nice" she recalls.
Certainly, it recommends that you want to try some company involved in the contest.
But believes that it is not necessary to win, but participation is beneficial.
He says that so far, it is still living on the known contacts and without the contest, he had perhaps not done.
"Some people I knew from the competition I started to work normally."
Fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in employees
in total around 1970s.
"I have seen that they show more loyalty and they are proud to participate in which won general recognition."
"It is not far from my own personal success, but it is the result of hard work of the entire team."
"That is my name that comes to the fore" says Lukáš today Pytloun modestly.
Successive wish him a calmer year than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory soon dispelled by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received first prize in the latest edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the year" last year in "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury assessed their efforts, with which it managed to turn a small technical factory in Česká Skalice in a signing with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged, but to all employees and improve our confidence to fight competition," says the winner of last year.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
So when the Government proposed to the father of Karel Žďárský rent for a small factory as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, she did not hesitate too. he resigned his position in the company that worked, and a couple of colleagues, who founded the company with his father in plastic batteries.
Shortly after, they began to specialise in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later became the largest producer of automatic pressure from the centre of Europe.
They also gained a bigger presence in public after a specialised achieveing success in the competition in the media.
"Not only our customers began to consider the Farmet brand as significantly better, but also the foreign partners began to appreciate the partnership with a company that had more success in his country" Karel Žďárský says.
Perhaps the past year was not in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained credit for trading results and 2008, and partly from 2009.
And exactly 2009 was the year it hardest to the machinery sales.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached to so many people, caused the companies stopped their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new equipment or technology.
"We obviously do not get rid of it."
"The earnings were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes even take unpopular measures.
However, they monitored the situation and kept the profits of the company, although it go at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut expenditure was in research and development.
"With the funding we have built a research centre and training, we increased presence in the international market and got magnificent assessments in national fairs," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis.
The revenue increase again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to contribute a victory sentiment, but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A survey revealing that is the ridiculous rules
The survey of Absurdez of the year is part for the fourth time in the match.
It has already managed to remove some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year went to document the administration to officials access online.
The decision made it more than a third of almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security called an extract from the commercial register, although officials can do it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech government of social security will no longer call an extract from the commercial register when he performs control of the constraints of policyholders," the spokeswoman Jana ČSSZ of Buraňová said.
The aim of the Absurdez survey of the year is consulting the rules and regulation must respect the companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and pretend that these are removed that are absurd.
This year provides for the fourth time one of the matches of the Hospodářské publication noviny and begins to create fondness among the general public.
While edition of the past year have involved three thousand voters this year almost reached four thousands.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations very well that must be respected just to deal.
"Maybe necessary number of roles for the declaration, we are first world," say Karel Havlíček of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic.
For years, simplifying business rules is a stated objective of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, Czech Republic is 74ª position, namely eight points worse than last year.
The Absurdez the contest was held for the first time in 2006 and every year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can point to some administrative or bureaucratic absurdez each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the www.firmaroku.cz website. Later, the organizer of the contest chooses to seven candidates for "antiprize" and during October, it allows the public votes through website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdez received more votes.
For the survey, this year there were more than a hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
The examples sent them both employers and professional associations and journalists.
"Among the finalists" of the contest it was, for example, the requirement that the vehicles for maintaining roads and motorways pay or the toll that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two baths paint every two years the walls.
The list of the 1970s proposals this year is published in the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which is always at the beginning of November in the place of Wenceslao in Prague, part of an event in which they are personalities of political and social world.
This year, for example, they attended this minutes of the contest Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity can not stand if the State makes barriers to entrepreneurs all the time, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs currently unnecessarily complicated trade," Minister of Industry and Trade Kocourek Martin announced.
Efforts to remove the absurd rules do not stay to nothing.
At 2007, which more annoyed people was the obligation of the company to communicate with a move from three days to corporate office in the area of continuous operation, intend to go with a position to a fair or exposure.
It was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, the communication to the office of work by foreign workers of business trips of up to 30 days removed in the so-called green card.
And third, won one.
The Absurdez of 2009 was the rules for the physiotherapists to have in its consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two levels of soil.
So this year the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes the socially responsible companies
The projects are valued environmental, humanitarian, educational or sport.
The novelty in the fifth edition of the Hospodářské contest noviny is the category Company responsible for 2010.
The job of the competition is to support responsible and fair business.
"We want to support businesses to address the impact of their activity on the environment and to support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of mobile operator Vodafone company, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the tender of Subversive of the year.
For this new special subcategory of the edition of this year of the main contest Company Vodafone 2010 companies submitted for commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each is inspiring and would enable us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activity varies quite between the two, the common denominator is the support and the consideration offered.
In one case, it is for the disabled in other personal problems or health.
Fourteen among the finalists of the Republic he was, for example, the praguense software company and Netera, which supports the formation of unofficial sports equipment among its workers, who later matches involved in various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the area of Pardubice is the Isolit-Brave company, which has already been seven years being the main aportador of money to sponsor disabled children.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery shop that particular concern about the health problems of its workers because they make up over 70% of the group. it received the title Company responsible for the central Czech Republic and Vodafone tender Company of the year it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc he even won MiRyz company Soft, accounting for reduced working hours, below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title also attached it because it primarily buys Czech manufacturers, it supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our activities of production and administration produce the least possible impact on the environment, the company Ryznarová Miluše explains.
The company Enlogit for THE region also believes Ústí about the health of their employees and, with each laptop, it offered a chair and ergonomic keyboards to them. in addition, it supports the work from home and in its corporate events using the services of catering for a local company protected.
"In addition, we supported the scholarship Person in distress, to help the local roma community," the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý comment.
They are also in a good place with a quote Praní company from laundry to čištění in the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive benefits of a particular how they affect their pension funds.
"We provide benefits in food, transport, improved skills and entertainment," says Josef Strapáč, company Bruntál construction Czasch, winner in the region of Moravia-Silesian Silesia.
In the category of Company responsible for Company of the year was appointed to all regional finalists of Vodafone competition automatically who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it to the 15 of August to the organisers.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were incomplete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the companies sellers did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the tender of Company responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified of the "primary" contest Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual nominations for this contest are not allowed, because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the year," Karel Goldman of the consultancy Bison & Rose explains.
Police made arrests during a public auction in the building of Agricultural Fund, in Pilsen
The police against corruption in the past made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund days.
The detectives handcuffed to a local entrepreneur of the means and the property entrepreneur Luboš G.
Apparently, this attempt to manipulate a public auction under way for the restoration of rights in such a way that the auction received the ground needs interesting.
I had to pay for that to Luboš G. million kronor half.
"At the moment I can only say that the police seeking a man for bribery during a public auction and tender," the head of the attorney general of Zelená Pilsen Antonie Právo said, adding that currently can not divulge more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, police loosen the employer of 46 years.
On the way in which it could influence public auction, given little official information, can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman of the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Černá answered the questions of Právo said that the police really made the arrest in the seat of Pilsen and was during a public auction.
"It is a customer, not one of our employees," it needed.
According to Černá, public auction is called "Call for proposals of land transfer under the law on Earth" and made when there are several interested parties on the ground.
"These people during the call, offer a value higher than their return, which must be transferred to the value of land says."
"Based on the offers, the purchasers is determined and then Agricultural Fund transfer the land to the person who provides the highest offer" explained the spokeswoman of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on who was to present to call and, as both are interested person because it acquired several rights restitution, proposed to stakeholders in the ground that it would not participate in the auction.
For that, it was acquiring a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, she had so much money.
Luboš G. had special Pilsen contacts inside for a long time.
It was the former head of PF Václav Sankot, that was charged to dispatch a replacement for which a construction decision had been issued.
For example, Luboš G. just getting from the Fund some sites earmarked for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where pole position would be build a major road to the industrial area of Borská.
Higher then changed them very very good form with the magistrate for a house in the historic centre of the city with a value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, on the contrary, the blocked sites would prevent the building.
The families will have to pay additional costs of several hundred kronor per month
Households will have to pay for January not only by all types of energy, but also by water and electricity, supplements for heating and, in some cases, rents.
So the families will have to come from the portfolio as January, several hundred kronor per month more than now.
The price of electricity increases at 4.6%, the gas around 2% in some cities will have to pay more to 10% by water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
Rising electricity for families living in apartments should promote some 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, the main providers of electricity reduced prices, because it is growing support for the production of energy from renewable sources, specifically photovoltaic energy.
However, the gas more expensive moderately, especially when the heating is used more and more consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred kronor a year.
While electricity and gas more expensive across the country, the price of central heating varies from one place to another.
Plans for price rises particularly the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January by the central heating some 50 kronor on the month, while the families of Liberec pay more than 1,000 additional kronor a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to support a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the income of infrastructure.
If the revenue does not vary, praguenses will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern bohemia, where current prices are among the highest rates, they will become more expensive 7.4%.
They can greatly increase the price of renting 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where regulation will end January.
For example, the ICC Byty company, which owns in Ústí Nad Labem around 2,500 flats, will increase the income from January to 100%.
The company will bring to justice those who disagree with the new income.
The regulated rents, which benefit the residents of about 300,000 flats, could increase next year to 10%.
The Czech young people drink Fernet and with rum. Beer is no longer way, because it makes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka or even sake whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These drinks that bring young drinkers with an age in medical care less than fifteen years.
Children who end up lying in the hospital constantly to overcome the hangover is no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who are in such cases in the admissions of paediatrics of the hospital.
"Drink beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a drink."
"The fashion now is the strong spirits," says in Právo central to the head of paediatrics of the Hořovice bohemian Hospital, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they manage to take a bottle to his father in the cupboard, it can be whisky, but usually it is Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and that it does not smell so much," explains.
The spokeswoman of the university Hospital Motol also confirms it, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, Fernet or rum is often."
"Those are the modern spirits, especially among students."
"In some cases, they use brandy that was at home," he adds Jurinová.
According to the Pelikán head, they are thirteen drinkers and fourteen years those that are used to be hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where it operates from this year, it worked for a decade in paediatrics in Motol, where ambulances were young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter four times."
"It started the twelve years when they brought it with 3.5 of alcohol in the blood, as well as a mixture with ecstasy," says dr from the department about this case.
"It was Holešovice fair in celebration of dance."
"The interesting thing is that your mother nor surprised that her daughter disappeared 48," the head is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest from parents or even its clear tolerance towards drink from your children to consider the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak properly of dependency.
"It is meant by alcohol a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with them, which does not occur in children."
"When they drink alcohol, repeatedly failed, fairly consistently because of social or family environment," explains the Pelikán head.
According to the Jurinová spokeswoman, this year at the children's hospital of Motol they were in hospital until the middle of November forty drunk children.
However, the statistics show only those that go with a serious poisoning and must remain in hospital.
Young drinkers who, after travelling medical examination, go home with parents or the police, do not count.
In cases where children simply to meet after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán three seasonal ups and downs that can quote the day of witches, End the Year and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad marks or, on the contrary, they celebrate the holiday."
"On the day of the bruges I have come to see simultaneously in admissions up to seven drinks children," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, they have the advantage that the following day do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and glucose, is prevented by the injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients it needs to the body.
"These are much better, because after a restless night, rose and it does not hurt anything to them."
"They are just confused about where they are," he says Pelikán, adding that often patients lose good humour at least when they see the expenses they have created.
In the ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I visited them directly to children how much it cost intoxication and they would have to spend all summer in a work for young people so you earned enough to pay that night," he adds Pelikán.
Maybe health insurance, in their view as regressive measure, which returned often to people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 jets are for the first time in other people's hands in Spain
Two L-159 jets full of five, the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the plane Home C-295M, divided Tuesday for Seville, where is the manufacturer of aircraft House - EADS.
It is the first time a device is left who is not the Czech army.
At the moment they are only abroad for flights of practice or demonstration.
L-159T1 two-seater is the version, which the Czech army used and that was still in state to fly.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seater.
These are still retained in Air Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, Omnipol company, was made position of them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the department of defence press indicates that still does not know herself when the aircraft will physically Vodochody withdraw.
"The single-seat L-159 jets, however, were separated from the aircraft repaired a long time ago, without additional investment or contributions from the Ministry."
"L-159T1 two-seater exchanged in its current state," he said Pejšek Právo.
He added that the army does not remain without two-seater planes, as May of 2009, the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract by a level of 200 million kronor for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 for twos-seater devices.
One of the new aircraft already received the army July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS was committed to the aircraft are added to the team of some allied countries.
"In the contract stated clearly that EADS company is to cut the L-159 jets and will be used for the practice of pilots of NATO countries."
"It depends on the buyer to decide how it is going to use them in this framework" Pejšek says.
The Hospodářské noviny newspaper published before time, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The five L-159 exchange for a plane Home and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3,500 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not summon a bid for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of defence claims that the exchange promotes future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army claimed to Air 72 aircraft and employs 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft House will probably have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court Of Justice because an auction should choose the aircraft doing and not making contact with a single manufacturer.
The army already received three aircraft House and the latter should reach the praguense Kbely airport in a fortnight.
A forefinger longer than cancelling indicate a risk for cancer more experienced
Men who have the index longer than cancelling are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of study published Wednesday in the British journal of cancer.
It could depend on testosterone level, male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men aged up to 60 years," said co-author of the study, Ros Eeles a professor at the Institute for research on cancer at the University of Warwick.
So the finger could help determine in particular what men would have to undergo a test for prostate cancer, whether it is linked to a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
1994-2009 Over the period, it made monitoring with a british counterparts more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the Indian ocean at the righthand shorter than cancel.
They presented the same chance of suffering from prostate cancer than 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%. after the men aged less than 60% reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the long fingers both in question, set in prenatal period, reflecting different levels of hormones that is exposed the foetus in the matrix.
A lower level of testosterone is a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, professor Václav Pačes, said that knows ČTK the study, but that does not seem to you that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "proved completely."

American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"

Shells can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind a barrier, a wall or a trench.
Certainly, a normal protection can be used and, when he sends his murderous metallic chips rain, it can be crucial in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for infantry who uses "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulated in such a way that they find the target, they point to the same its ray lasers, which determines the range, then get a precise sights and, based on the same, he corrects the start line and the trigger."

A Fujitsu spokesman explained that medium-term other 100 employees of the consortium, who previously were scattered throughout the region, will be there.
Supply is highly attractive, the collective office in Star Park will favour the way to work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only occupant in Bad Homburg.
Ceo Bernd Wagner said, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new change of a major company in the region caused glee yesterday between those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
The platoon leader of economy of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" has earned.
This is a "wonderful recognition of the site."
Fujitsu is based in the city, the establishment is a great boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Hombruger Bod, Michael Korwisi (the greens) deplores of the decision by Fujitsu.
The first informed the city on purpose.
"Of course we have offered the company our aid" Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers under the control of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in difficulties.
After all, economic reasons producieron the fall.
In this way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous position.
"I hope that the owner and the pattern of the building are cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbour "Kleine Vertikale part in" supernumerary Marienbader buildings Platz ten years of a controversial building project of bath city.
As joint project of the city and a private company projects between the station and the city is a new entry to the city, which is in charge of the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking places and on the level of buildings.
2001 They have been the investment council and the valuation Software manufacturer for reservations systems Amadeus, and then it joined Siemens with the house of Fujitsu computer.
At 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investment COMPANY in Madrid.
The consortium, Fujitsu native of Tokyo, is recognised as the world's third biggest provider.
It has, for example, computers and servers, and also serves on time.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, Fujitsu all roads has more business in Munich.
The branch Fujitsu Technology Solutions settles from Bad Homburg, in Frankfurt-Niederrad the next subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
So 7,000 square metres in the building offices of Star Park have been leased.
The ancient complex in the 1920s, its name refers to their level with star, among other is home to the central association of electrotechnic and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
The anguish seizes more and more of Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet service provider has removed the platform of revelations of his server.
Perhaps behind political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is apparently held in England.
The platform of revelations of Wikileaks is always the target of criticism, always more severe in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former u.s official and now they are looking for a homeland of the Internet in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, appeal to other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of wanted persons of INTERPOL, should remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks removed from the Amazon reared."
"To speak freely in the country of freedom," told the activists of revelations by the Twitter post on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents his server.
Internet activists had called in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon Web services to be able to cope with high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using his servant by Wikileaks, after an employee of senator Joe Lieberman had asked for investigations chain, told Cnn in a phone call to the office of Lieberman.
The chair of the board of the Senate for the security of the country had threatened to boycott, Amazon reported the "Guardian."
"I had hoped that Amazon take these measures before, with previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks" said the senator.
Lieberman also asked that the platform also prohibited in other countries use of server.
"Illegal, monstrous and thoughtless process of Wikileaks brings into play our national security and threaten lives in the world, said in a communiqué of the independent senator.
"No company responsible, or American or foreign, to assist Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange is wanted in Sweden for rape suspect, is on the list of people wanted by INTERPOL.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent," the Australian 39 years is a prisoner in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot as their enemy.
The spokeswoman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that has existed threats.
"He had even called on the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why it is feared for the safety of Assange, said Hrafnsson.
So it is not revealing the location of the founder of Wikileaks.
Obviously Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the person in charge of the disclosures by Wikileaks should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, said an adviser prime minister Stephen Harper, ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use drone."
Among housing Blanca and Assange a major row grows.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman of us president Barack Obama described as "absurd and ridiculous" that Assange has called for the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she is responsible to order recently to diplomats involved in espionage.
"I am not entirely sure why the opinion of a kind with a website should concern us," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of the powerful country are much more than their website."
The American government must demonstrate the effectiveness of its database generally.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the National Centre against terrorism, was appointed as the exceptional in charge, announced the White House.
So Travers is responsible for developing the "important structural reforms" that are necessary in light of the leak of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the case, as well as to change the full information to the government and to protect it.
In addition, the us government announced that to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, they should endanger the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to put us in touch with them," said the spokesman for the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The university of ice cream
In "Gelato University in Bologna" dealer ices-cream at the best time of year to prepare.
The basic course of three days for future ices-cream farmer has the greatest influx and visitors from around the world.
In fact where are all the ice cream?
Of gelatiere and gelataio.
Gelatiere makes the cream according to the rules of the Italian art of ice cream.
The gelataio with a spatula the cream of the ice cream from the counter, extends the rolled wafer and sells it.
In order to know that it is not necessary to go to dell'Emilia Anzola in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" Carpigiani Italian company.
The manufacturer has given the university of ice cream with freezer at 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals.
The basic course of three days for future ices-cream farmer has the greatest influx and visitors from around the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice-cream shop from home.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others in the soft ice cream their vague.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky to professor in the art of California, i love the slow movement of food and in the future it wants to offer a quality product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke Berlin, is counsel, and wants to create something own in some years within an enervating work.
Two Egyptian young people dream of opening a ice-cream shop in Cairo.
A man of Malta and another of Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream of their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, because their children the Italian ice cream love them.
The basic ice-cream Luciano Ferrari dealer then explains to the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not decisive only good taste, but also its silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano especially do not forget their training or hedge cream of the house and national higher in the south of the country. "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to find the easiest.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: powdered milk, cream, milk, sugar and stabilisers in a beater, which warms up everything with an electronic programme up to 85 degrees, and at the moment it cools it up to four degrees.
Soon open the tap of the machine and a pasteurised white basic cream, the basis for all the milk ice cream rates.
Suddenly, the teacher asks. Can the ice cream cream only be produced from natural elements or without estabalizador?
How can it be given a free rein some desire to experiment?
Luciano advised that they confuse trends of the time.
Perhaps the one that speaks of ice cream "not only natural ingredients," has used stabilising, especially a natural product, guar gum, kidney bean to guar.
Of course this can be done without ice cream stabiliser, you only have to buy it a day, putting it in a bag and customer will bite a resounding granite ice cream.
Some variations in the media are allowed.
Flavourings are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the teacher Luciano distinction between ingredients that are bought in the section of fruit or sweets from the supermarket.
Furthermore, dusts and pasta.
"All providers will try to wash perfumed ingredients in their goods."
"However they have ever experienced."
Sherbets and fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
Even with the ice cream cream of the white background, with eggs will become a yellow cream and cocoa powder as the basis for all the pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the ice cream makers.
Luciano please every time they make four different types of ice cream of vanilla, chocolate and countersinks moca, with or without eggs in the background, more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also do the same experiment with fruit ice cream rates.
He knows better is not that it is necessarily more aroma of tofe or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of hazelnuts known to nuts, if contains more hazelnuts.
The working group is adored ice cream of kiwi, which uses more fruits, less water and less stabiliser.
First a balanced blend highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The ice cream is preparing a artimética problem. The peach puree is used by much sugar, is needed to reduce the proportion of sugar from the basic recipe.
For the lemon ice cream it needs an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano brings a utensil with which it determines the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (measure of the vinicultor for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately the tables provide the account.
To make ice cream not require more than physical application, as before.
Not only the utensil for automated preparation of the basic mass helps.
There is also a utensil, in which the ice cream mixture is fought together and it cools off below zero to temperature.
Despite everything, all automation remains outside the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo is tainted from the top down to himself and his colleagues with fruit puree, a minifirst giant unsupervised.
"In all directions," says the teacher Luciano, "it is only a matter of time that goes something like this."
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European safety authority Efsa has infiltrated food in the industry that experiments with genetically modified plants.
At the moment this makes it the group of Testbiotech experts, who consider an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," he said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the panel Efsa on genetically modified plants, and another expert from Efsa is also employed for years in the Ilsi association.
The corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has been significantly in the Efsa verification of genetically modified crops, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
The Efsa are in paragraphs in the same terms with the documentation Ilsi situation and imitate the company, which is controlled by the Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interest.
So recently, a senior from Efsa was without support or time of transition for Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his side.
Also recently Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between authorities in the inspection of the EU and the industry, which made the General Oficinal the Environment as well as a clear-sighted member of the EU.
However, Efsa can not recognise any conflict of interest.
It uses all the formal data, including some in the industry, provided they are a large and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
It does not require the experts who work in Efsa which they have no contact with the industry.
But they should display such contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the united states.
It calls itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without the Lobby.
In this case, independent experts, as Then, complain that transgenic plants without investigating the food for the animals are allowed and that the influence of gm plants on the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, is genetically modified maize in agriculture," he said Then.
Current practice is only looking isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If the risks do not look for. how are you going to be? ," he asks, prosecutor, Then.
Los Angeles Hilbeck believes in the same way.
The scientist to investigate from 1994 field of genetic engineering and now she works in the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly, in the united states and Europe, to influence or to discredit the scientists criticism.
For that reason, there are few scientists who are not influenced by corporations.
For businesses, the studies critics are not published as a rule.
"The industry controls the investigation of security," says Hilbeck.
The sign of stones
Gsell Uli has achieved together about 400 kilograms.
Monday was before the station of Stuttgart, with the Tuba the backs.
There were demonstrations
It snowed.
History is known. September the bulldozers arrived and began to demolish a large piece of the North wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again be the same. Thousands and thousands were s21 against the suspension of millions in the station.
As was sealed, most of the wing hizó rubble.
Defeat in 6.000, 7,000 pieces.
Muschelkalk Crailsheimer a rough, soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is in Ostfildern sculptor, is 43 years old.
A couple has secured parts.
"These stones are relics."
"They do not have to disappear."
It is enthusiastic: "Cheap and poor, simple and natural a stone."
As he once said, he smelled smoke cigarettes.
He still does not know what he will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell.
The sign of stones from Stuttgart to a forest in Tubingen in an ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected their Stein-Reich stone.
The 44 year old man deals with old stones.
It has bought everything from demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be a shame, would grind gravel or send it to the dustbin," he says in his office, a wooden small house that was once a care home.
They insulted him and threatened, explains, when September, he appeared in newspapers, that he had bought the rest of the North wing to the demolitions company.
He spoke with the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that i could not do anything for demolition.
And when it happened, it was reasonable, when the stones are still used.
About 200 opponents of S21 took mazizo from 80 kilos, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 Euros.
Some also took it as memory but with the hope of being able to restore it in a restructuring.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, a 25 cargo trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest a long time ago it was sold.
Master of gardens, gardener landscaper, commissioned projects.
They come from all quarters and took what they could take in the trunk and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impetus for a long time it was becoming "the wall" in the division of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it were not for the political component."
It amounts to their four-wheel drive vehicle, a tour of his great kingdom 20 hectares.
He studied law, he interrupted his studies, and then Biology, interests computers and finally it works with stones.
And he is loving of stones.
Metheglin to 4,000 tonnes of stone.
It transports its treasures across Germany.
It claims to be old stone being the largest in the country.
It stops.
In the snow there are artistic stones of arenaceous perforated.
"Pertencieron to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
White, yellow, warm limestone, is enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The way through the forest.
It says a lot. Red arenaceous an earlier piece of plant in Karlsruhe.
And it remains.
"Beautiful travertine."
The mazizos once belonged to the gallery of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Over in the snow, stones and stories, " the travertine police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite of Sankt church, tufa Blasien the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen think about as he carved stones before it moved them with a simple equipment and cart, it feels very devotee.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
It has not become rich, immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to do to treating one of stones, stonecutters in addition, a sculptor, a herrero, a glassworker and a gardener has been above the forest.
"We worked hard, but it is satisfactory," says the man who is in charge to take advantage of the rest.
Then it should go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Battle of talent around great potentials
One active influx in the buffet.
16 students crowd themselves around rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Brunswick and manufacturer of Vokswagen cars has invited a factory to students of mechanical engineering and design.
A sort of contest of ideas, they must speak on the car of the future with the BW workers and learning everything on Volkswagen.
Competing in the same way many companies, like BW, meet in a hand-to-hand fight on the privileged minds in partnerships with universities.
His mission: To make the students with most talented of universities, before they enter the job market and are made by others.
And as universities do not make publications on the skills of their students, it is intended to monitor the exceptional talents on practical projects and to catch them.
The second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium won the talent.
One young lady of the Personnel Department delivers ballpoint pens, gomitas and folders with the logo of BW.
It explains to forward the young talent programmes in practice and work for students, and it shows its ways in the partnership.
Nico Seals of the Technical University of Brunswick bears the project with BW.
He sees advantages for both sides. "Students make contact with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, BW know students see more of nearly interesting candidates and taking them as possible future work."
Some partnerships, Seals, are not rare.
The first is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," he says Seals.
The fight for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If not they have to announce and, above all, to achieve a highly skilled workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI by its acronym in German) October, 40,000 vacant positions engineers.
And, according to prognósticos of VDI, this void of engineers will grow even more.
In the company of auditing and advice, KPMG, Roman Dykta in the hunt for talent.
It is expensive recruitment events like the race KPMG, a kind of modern yincana, in which participants must find their way through coordinated of GPS.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the us the following year.
In addition, the participants can see the subsidiaries of KPMG and learn about the company.
You decide who should go in two rounds of choice in the exit.
Crème de crème of many participants just go to the united states.
Universities are increasingly in choosing and polishing the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight of the mass."
"The simple step alone we had left."
For the scout Dykta the notes deliver results.
"So today we are a similar action in the past year old with all the participants."
"Some are near its end, and ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also in the hunt, especially small and medium-sized classic with its exhibitions of work.
"We tried to get students in specialist fairs."
"Something about" Intersolar Sitha, says Stübe, in charge of staff for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems the new generation.
Currently on the website of the company include 35 vacant positions.
"It is very difficult to fill the vacant positions."
"It costs time and money," he says.
A shorter route is contact with teachers from the university.
Solarworld works with several colleges, for example, Freiberg University.
"Teachers advise that their ideas can be done practices with us or be done.
Faces are not made advertizing campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages. Personal atmosphere, level hierarchies and convenient communication.
"A great partnership usually can not offer it," says Stübe, in charge of staff.
In search of a job, money is no longer the most important.
The crucial factors are flexible schedules, children or good chance of advancement.
According to a study of the Great Place to Work, Solarworld Instituts 55 shows of the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual list of best job providers German.
So he calls the employee satisfied it is with the work and the atmosphere in the same and observed the conditions.
Stübe, in charge of staff is also extra points in its classification of its applicants to work.
"I think the applicant pay particular attention to the external ratings of a potential employer," he says.
Reiner, Kriegler of Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that they earn reputation as employers.
It advises his clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, measures internally.
"The best way to become attractive as employer is the employees ' claims.
In the jargon of the sector Employer Branding is internal also called promotion of corporate identity within the group.
"Some used happy are the best ambassadors."
When it is people who identify with the company, then promotion for the employer by known friends is done directly.
"It is like a game with gang," says Kriegler.
Obama for new oil drilling
From the coast of the us state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has been made in recent years a new oil drilling.
The government in Washington issued a forceful ban and he cancelled his previous plans of unquestionable way.
Also before the Atlantic coast to stay new drilling closed at the moment.
This announced the minister of the interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be effective at least the next five years, it is the explosion of the oil platform Deepwater Horizon "" April.
Before the misfortune that life to eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental disaster in the us, president Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the west of the gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters that wanted to reduce the dependence of THE new oil supplies from abroad.
Until now it has not been entirely clear who is the responsibility of the irreparable oil spill in the gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is British energy partnership BP, which is facing million.
A commission of inquiry ordered by Obama will present its results on thursday.
For October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, raised the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Later, different peteroleros consortia submitted applications for new attempts drilling.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster using some tougher controls and stricter safety regulations.
Currently the supervisory authority responsible, after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, root reform.
Obama announces of parallel track to close the lucrative tax loopholes for corporations of oil and gas.
The industry says publicly that the total extraction in the gulf will be lower because of stricter regulation to date.
"The plans of the government are the biggest obstacle to growth in the industries of oil and gas," says the outcome of the current poll conducted by the company advises BDO - before the ban extraction Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector. "Nobody knows exactly what changes the rules."
Investment in new mining projects extend so far, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
Water from rivers is brown oil, smells like a petrol station. Dumped millions of litres of oil have destroyed the nature of the Ogonilandia Nigerian.
People living on the theft, corruption and the illegal trade of oil.
Akpobari to Celestine is well.
"You do not get tired," the environmental activist to journalists. "Today it will spend enough oil before your eyes."
The Nigerian of 37 years was able to photograph to boys get in the water until the chest with the gloss of lights reflected in turmoil on the surface. With the colourful gloss of water, the scene appears almost beautiful.
You do not see on the surface brown spots floating oil.
It took prawns in handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the border of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the flow of water are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil with a broken pipe was dumped in a wetland.
The fish from the outskirts of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish. That, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogonilandia, is regarded as one of the infestedest regions of the world.
In the course of the river that passes through mangrove swamps, widespread devastation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the driver of the boat brings a brown broth, which plunges his hand in the water, will make a full of oil.
The roots of the trees of the mangrove swamps rise from the ground like dark woods of liquorice, sadly they isolate the palms that hung up and their palms.
In vain flocks of birds seek, as if they were in wetland as always. As soon as the barrier from outside is quiet, expands a kind of ghost calm of a paradise, with smell of petrol station.
"What happens is an ecological fight," says, shy, Celestine Akpobari. "We lived in constant danger to health."
The military comparison.
The ogoni settlement is a bitter battle for years. The first European explorers burst in more than 60 years ago, organised the first resistance in 80 with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, had to place its first factory the Shell partnership in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for employees of oil.
Even today the return of companies to Ogonilandia is banned. While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold of the entire delta, a size three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of mining and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, oil camps in Ogonilandia were calm, the site is too unstable for the partnership.
Two hundred metres of steel platforms excelled as eccentric sculptures of water. "Little Christmas trees" known affectionately to the heads of the drills.
They have up to 50 years, most current total corrosion.
Constantly mall is a pillow, he believes, Akpobari one constant in inkjet oil in the water.
According to assessments of experts, two billion litres in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta have been spilled over. Year after year, the amount of oil was pervasive, and the failure of the ship "Exxon Valdez" for 21 years in the sea of Alaska, one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for lasting environmental region, she will fight in this way.
While the consortium of Shell and organised oil thieves is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the mall pillows on the verge of breaking up and pipes with flights as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell normally applies particularly low safety standards in the world conventional ones, blame the scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008. The failings of the pipes are only "on a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In a place that seems far from forgotten is a manufacturer of oil under free sky entities are among the mangrove swamps. They are naked and oil covered.
Between one of many barrels, which are often linked to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily found at the scene, a fire flames. a small illegal refinery.
In a barrel, oil warms up in flames more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
The first penetrates petrol through the pipes in the container, then the oil pipe drips and eventually leaves diesel.
This way, Michael and four employees produce next up to four barrels of diesel from 300 litres. "Contributes 34,000 naira to" around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the fuel shortages in one of the biggest oil states of black Africa.
Nigeria boasts only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of 40 diesel engine of Euro-penny per litre illegal heaters can hardly be alone. They reduce the value of its raw material.
It comes from "those of búnkers," who pocketed a ball the network of pipelines running through Ogonilandia. According to experts, this step at least 16 million litres of oil per day across the Niger delta are lost.
Only a tiny part of the material stored temporarily sophisticated premium is clear: illegally Organised criminal networks, also high political and military figures belong, observed the best part of rain tanks and sell it cheap in world markets.
The Akpobari the activist purely academic debate about whether the environmental disaster is due to the handling of the population or the loose way of production rather.
"If the oil companies do not behave as invasive and they had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be sabotage or illegal, or" refinery.
While the ogoni conditions are destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium. "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, as the Chinese."
Michael brings them nervous.
"It is high time you go," the muscular Ölmann says.
"Soldiers can come at any minute."
If the special unit of the army is illegal refiners, it does not threaten them, arrest them, if not a painful bribery.
Soldiers from the north would also like all Nigerians to benefit from the raw material.
"This doomed invention has completely shattered our country," says Akpobari.
Researchers identify dangerous defects in factory in the engines of the A380
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible flaw in factory, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
The Qantas airline wants to call the manufacturer of the engine.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus made a landing at the beginning of emergency that had more luck than you can imagine. The Australian authorities of air safety perceived thanks to their research a major security problem in the drivers of some A380, and warning of a possible defect in factory.
The potential defect has complicated impact. By connecting sleeves, fissures by tiredness can be caused or cracks, announced the authorities of the ATSB in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic failure in the engine."
The affected engines made by Rolls-Royce from 20 aircraft from the A380 series.
Among the Qantas-Airbus that he had to make a forced landing 4 of November in Singapore.
The Australian airline begins legal measures against the British manufacturer of turbines.
He presented it demands in the federal court in Sydney who made possible legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, Qantas director, said that his airline will demand compensation for the November incident.
In the hallmarks of the engine lost pieces and its wing is impaired.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the kind of petrol as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines, they must be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced that they will conduct more tests to the superJumbos equipped with the affected engines.
Safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security problem has become sufficiently important as informing all concerned.
After the emergency landing of Qantas team, the airline kept their land A380 fleet for many weeks.

Deusche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate its symbol. According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its towers of offices in its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could help up to 500 million Euros.
Deutschen Bank recently established its headquarters. The twin towers in the district of banks in Frankfurt were modernized. while the bankers returned to their old place of work.
But now the financial partnership apparently wants to benefit the costs of the reonvación, and is seeking a buyer for both skyscraper, as "the Financial Times Deutschland" based on a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for sale in the project.
"We always checked if it agrees to own the property or sell them and then return to rent them," he said.
So the biggest credit institution of Germany back to renounce the headquarters of his company after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in the middle of 2007 by 272 billion of investor in a fund of housing and then made the necessary adjustments.
Energy reforms made some figures of around 200 million Euros.
A sale would involve much money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the famous towers of the newspaper as "Greentowers" at around 500 million Euros.
If the buildings renovated into a fund for bank are sold or an independent investor that was not developing at the time, he said the spokesman.
Thousands of mourning for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought the buried miners, who made by deceased after explosions in a mine.
They have not yet been possible to find corpses, because the security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago a huge explosion in the mine Pike River near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years were buried in the mine.
A poll in the place of misfortune was introduced, but it did not uncover any sign of survival.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team could lower for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts conclude that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
It has not been possible to recover the bodies to date.
The relatives and friends of the dead with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright gloss of the sun in Greymouth in New Zealand island in the south.
Observe silence for two minutes.
In tribute of the buried miners, 29 tables with helmets, lamps and names of the miners were.
There were also personal photographs and objects beneath clothing and surf boards.
The flags waved at half mast on government buildings in the country.
New Zealand hope that the miners returned to the surface "of the depths of the Earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government said the participants of the memorial act.

The devil, soldier!
Does Gore in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicholas Winding Refn returns to explore the boundaries of the genre with his epic battles of Walhalla "Nascent."
Public what about Winding Refn, when rolling "Nascent" Walhalla will have thought the Danish director?
A soldier seized Viking with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) free from his torturers and killed his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young viewers who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and its enemies the offal of their bodies with life when he is bad humour.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is called in fact, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters to be the most by one or two phrases or a couple of painful death cries.
Otherwise, tuna and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland are quiet and enjoy, that behind the scenes to offer the world Viking around a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for film-makers grown and interested in the existentialism and movements of house very calm.
When a film has several groups of recipients is a pity they can not be ruled out other.
Winding Refn manager believes his savage and the trilogy on dealing drugs hairdo "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refused to make their work is for all public with a little more humour in the mainstream or less brutality of artistic home.
A cerebral and some offal featuring can not deter the majority of the supporters of artistic cinema.
The majority of fans of the action is dying of boredom, if Unojo take a boat to Jerusalem with troops of violent cristioneros missionaries by interpretable reasons and remains stuck an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and back to shut up.
It is a pity that "Nascent" Walhalla has not found distributing film in Germany and only published on DVDS.
It is a calamity against the wonderful pictures, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of cinema occasionally exciting, that deserves attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, all atmosphere, a febrile dream turned into film.
And that is why there is no escape for viewers.
Refn condede just a moment of relaxation and its images melt and the dismal sound of critical moment are produced a knot in your throat, above all, the incredible hatred, from the hearts of the characters go towards him.
A blond young man, who supports faithfully to Unojo, only retains something like innocence, all the others are owned by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, at any time a soldier left hell for interim enemies and allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
It is the downfall, but for those who are perhaps only lost anyway.
Walhalla "Nascent" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and be surprised.
Experience.
Earthworks mysterious
The atomic energy organisation IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to think about this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight from 5 to 6 of September of 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter aircraft I attacked a mysterious cubical building in Syria.
It is on the border of the Euphrates. the biggest and nearest town, 30 km ace-Saur is Dair.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy agency (IAEA), is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently constructed with help from North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley that leaves the river.
According to reports from the international intelligence service of the us company April end of 2008, design a current reactor under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very appropriate for the plutonium production, with that nuclear weapons are built.
However, the technical one as soon as it is for other purposes than for those in the 1950s.
The company said in a video presentation with blurred satellite imageries.
They showed with an animation by computer where were the components of the reactor before destruction that was a small copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear power plant at Yongbyon.
They also taught photos that showed the building from the vicinity or the interior.
It was a short time that the reactor was in operation, but was not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better - known than at that time, the enigmas older were made.
The former president of the UNITED STATES, George W. Bush unveiled recently in his memoirs that before the attack the company were absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but as soon as he saw indications that the country a programme of nuclear weapons existed.
In Europe, several intelligence agents still prefer to be prudent and they only talk of an "alleged reactor," but they believe the company "reasonable"
They need solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When i asked him it was a reactor, a senior diplomat of responded in summer lapidary way that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have issues."
The Syrians disposed very quickly in the rubble of alleged "war crippled building" and paved the ground thoroughly.
However, June of 2008 a team of IAEA under the command of the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found rastos of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been taken by people.
In addition, the IAEA made satellite images of a Member State, commercial vendors at the moments immediately after the attack, which should be more informative than it presented the company's
However, these pictures did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA can not verify their authenticity independently.
Syria was always to understand that it had never had a secret nuclear programme and built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli arms, explained Damascus.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after the analyses of particles.
Since then, refuses to discuss the matter, in the same way that, with regard to the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and into the ruins of the bombed building is banned.
Israel is also a strict silence.
"We will never make it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, confirmed the official position recently.
The investigation of the case has not produced results of June of 2008 and it gradually becomes a serious credibility problem for the government," as one western diplomat from high office is a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally remains a serious infringement against the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which ensure the IAEA.
The IAEA believes three teams as the key to progress in the clarification, "" functional connection with the alleged reactor, and others as they still exist.
The inspectors have not made public until now what equipment is, or what roles have, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated as Marj internal ace-Sultan to Masyaf, and Iskandariayah, arising again from the vicinity of located cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings around Masyaf with satellite images, that is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Perhaps it is on or immediately next to a military base, Syria and with this entry to three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna says that the Syrians fear a register that the united states has asked the IAEA to spy on military installations.
The detectives were alerted on the team thanks to the warnings of the secret service in the US.
Through satellite pictures, the IAEA has indications that it moves material between the three locations and provides to the border of the Euphrates.
A western diplomat with a high position in Vienna said that at least one team can be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," or restructuring or uranium enrichment. processes that are necessary for building nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor itself operates uranium that is enriched.
Where the uranium and should go where the plutonium for bombs must depart later, for these key issues are, at best, reasonable assumptions.
There are no doubts about whether the ruins, valuable clues that could recover, they are in three places.
As hundreds of trucks of soil disappeared, nobody has information about where they stand the rubble.
The OIAE considers salt mine unlikely al-Tibni in a few miles from el-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians in 1998 for their suitability as area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs of the orbit show that the Syrians done earthworks in the three alleged suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA asked for entry.
It may be coincidence but it helps to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic field deployment is said that the IAEA has used some months to develop an inspection plan, which the Syrians allowed to observe the potential military secret, only highlights the scale of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus is also critical.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was destroyed, so the issue is not much urgency for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a kind of ambassador to the united states uses the exceptional " inspection, one of the most rigorous ones than the Viennese nuclear authorities must establish controls.
Yukiya Expertise, the head of the IAEA, to suggest these inspections, spoke of "an option that I am open in the future," but vacillates.
It is very dangerous. The majority is needed government advice of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not just anxious to escalate.
On the other hand, as reflected a diplomat. ." And what happens if it does not find anything"
Love in the time of the war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie even began in the summer with the direction of his debut with no name.
She has written the script, a story of love between Bosnia and serbs.
It is not much more on this, but this is enough for the unrest.
The rumour is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with his serb rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
The associations of Bosnian women have protested so rapidly at the last minute they transferred some planned days of running in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been rolled in Hungary and post-production, but there are protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of women's organisation of war victims wrote to High Commissioner of the UN, unhcr by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of High Commissioner of the UN for refugees.
She has not been diplomatic for weeks, the women offered a meeting in Hungary that it rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Stories of love in the fields of violations are not, and Jolie on it exposes the victims enough about the script.
Her organisation in accordance with High Commissioner of the UN for refugees has recommended to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what Jolie has written for the scenes exactly?
The Bosnian ministry of culture who read the script, awarded after a tug-of-war a permit for recording in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear that Jolie was not in spite of everything.
Young author repeats that it does not pursue political intentions with her film, introduces much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains unclear.
In the second synopsis of the film circulates that sounds quite different. The lovers were together before the start of the war and again, when Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian field where he works as a guard.
What sounds markedly different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with torturer."
It is certainly Jolie film really begins before the war.
Pressure on it, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
At the moment they can achieve peace with the hackers Hollywood. While the script is illegally in the network, like many others before.

The democratic agenda
There is growing support democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is a major concern that unemployment.
In addition, largely in the region, is seen Brazil as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions from the latest survey of Latinobarómetro conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the poll was conducted regularly from 1995, it allows us to monitor the attitude changes in the region.
In the results of the survey this year, made in and principles of October, are two issues.
First, relatively lively humour in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of the attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased substantially in various countries around the coast of the Pacific in South America (consultation table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year of 2002, supporting democracy has grown from a small 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, democrats are convinced, which lowers the regional average (consultation chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region, said they were satisfied with the way democracy in their country works in practice, the same number as last year, but significantly higher than recorded 25% for 2001 (3) graphic.
Around 34% said that they trusted the Congress of his country and 45% in his Government, the same amount last year in both cases, but significantly higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been during the global financial crisis is probably because many Latin - American countries were affected by a brief recession and only enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a social network for stronger security has helped protect the poorest.
(The un Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin - American that marginally lives in poverty only increase by 2009 and this year has been reduced again to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (consultation chart 4).
The good economic performance in Brazil and the popularity of their outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and increased violent crimes.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America they mention the crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem that his country faces (consultation chart 5).
About 31% states that it is they or a close relative, has been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced from 38% last year and the lowest rate recorded for 1995.
The more positive gains reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy. some 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are essential for the development, while 2007 was just 56% (consultation chart 6).
Around 58% he agrees that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country, compared with 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela does the same (and 80% support private companies), although his leftist president, Hugo Chávez, expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is a country that has more leadership in the region, as 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, same number as last year) and Venezuela (9% against 11% a year).
However, the United States is considered the country's most influential of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds a degree in Ecuador, and Nicaragua Dominicana.
Elections to the rubbish
Nobody expected the general election 28 of November in Haiti would be perfect.
However, they spent so much worse than foreigners were afraid to try to help the country overcome after their problems.
Votes in the polls were introduced, some people voted several times, problems thrown in sewers, polling stations, destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including displaced groups for the January earthquake, wandered through the area trying to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, up.
A dozen candidates for the presidential ones, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
The protests, some of them violent and spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the civil servant of the United Nations highest in Haiti, said that relatively good elections in many ways were "some."
Observers from the Organization Of American States and the Caribbean said, cautiously, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, by serious, invalidating necessarily process."
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin should announce preliminary results 7 of December.
It is expected that tiebrake will be made to January.
Not all the expectations regarding the elections are not lost.
Both main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, has withdrawn its initial request in which they asked for cassation of the vote.
But problems can arise if the election authority declared that mr. Célestin, who as soon as it has support, if any, has happened to the second round.
Since the outbreak of cholera devastates the country and more than a million survivors of the earthquake are living in tents, is expected to be a large abstention.
At the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were unable to do so due to a lack of organisation.
Around 250,000 identity cards, need to vote, they had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There is a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in rebuilding Haiti.
And it was clear, also believe that the Haitians.
Moving from hoof to the centre
In the weeks have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great affection between the public who has increased his popularity index at 20 points, up more than 50%, the highest level it has been since his election of 2007.
In spite of everything, that can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether clearly affected ms Fernández leaving aside the intransigence of her late husband, his predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the signs are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, which continued into position of economic policy after his wife happened to him as president, even had a habit of producing budgets that undervalued the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income to its discretion.
In theory, the government of ms Fernandez lost their majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is split, a situation that has worsened after the death of Kirchner because of a heart attack 27 of October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced ms Fernández.
However, after a chaotic sessions in which a member gave a fist to another in the face and her colleagues blamed the bribe government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to discuss" said the president.
The 2010 budget, consequently, will apply next year, which will give the president a room for further action to spend it.
The economy is improving sharply. probably grow this year to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates, as wage demands from the unions, put it about 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who seized power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse caused the growth and poverty reduction were their priorities, instead of controlling inflation.
It refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and caused the INDEC, the statistical office, adapted the official statistics on inflation.
Moderate Fernandez president now these will policies?
It has called meetings between the private sector and the leaders of unions.
In addition, officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high price of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost growth achieved with a big devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps ms Fernández is signalling to want to restore financial links in Argentina with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bond holders who had refused to last a forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it appears that ms Fernández is on the verge of signing an agreement with grouped by governments in the Paris Club, which has around 6,700 million dollars.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not mean the supervision of the IMF, as usual.
However, last month Loved Boudou, the Economy Minister, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to make a new national Consumer Price Index, which seems the prelude to the clean-up of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Fernandez President wants to remain in politics when his term ends, given that it no longer has to your husband to his side.
If it does, the support of the middle class will need to win, much of which it has got tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentineans return from their summer holidays in place, the wave of affection for her will be dropped.
If he wants to win another election, it will have to decide if she repudiates or not, calmly, many of the policies of her husband.
Half of China's hurra
Voters in Taiwan are tackling a closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan on their big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible, they went 27 of November to elect mayors and councillors of five urban districts where it seems a broad assessment of president Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma has become a champion of feelings on the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a pact of partial free trade, changes in relationships with China from 1949.
Mr Ma passed the test, but almost.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five elections to mayorship, failed to obtain a majority of the votes.
Instead, the democratic progressive Party (PPD), he has opted for a total independence of Taiwan, gained nearly 50% of the votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the presidential ones, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years, the proportion of votes for his party has been dropped by around 8%.
For the first time, PPD tied with the KMT in the town councils.
In elections the classic elements of the Taiwanese elections could be seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with little flags and light clothing girls dancing.
It did not lack the mysterious assassination attempt in either.
They Roll, the son of Roll Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning by candidates KMT night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the girl in the face directly, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
The curious thing is that it was not possible to determine whether man tried to do damage to Roll him or take revenge against the nominee.
In any case, Ing Tsai, the leader of the PPD says, shooting affected the elections, sow doubts about PPD and voters opted for the KMT.
Perhaps only the big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that was not the continent.
Instead, the candidates talked about plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat from China.
The KMT and tend to publicise its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD avoided to encourage sentiment against China.
It is the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for economic survival of Taiwan.
On the other hand, Mr Ma said it had confirmed that its policy towards China was acceptable to most of the Taiwanese.
It is anticipated that the Beijing Government is bribing them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China did not lose time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Surely it would also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing would be to wait to pass the 2012 presidential elections.
In any case, PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago it was in a bad situation. its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, were jailed accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of mr Tsai, a new generation emerged from moderate and PPD is struggling to attract professionals and young people.
Mr Tsai has been welcomed pleasingly as a candidate of the PPD for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, which fulfilled mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mr Tsai announced the plans for a group of experts who acts as a point of contact between the PPD and China, where negotiations without preconditions can be done.
Mr Tsai told the Taiwanese public that his party represents a "reliable alternative" precipitate approach of Mr Ma with China.
Mr Chen is furious for change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that candidates had left PPD better unemployed if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even gave Mr Su, a pragmatic one, who did not present the presidential ones.
Without Mr Chen even intercedes, PPD will be difficult to choose between its possible candidates.
The KMT must also make an examination of conscience.
Assessments of Mr Ma has been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; candidates from the KMT did not want to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the rich and poor growing differences between.
A spokesman for the KMT says that it will rebuild his cabinet, as well as local team.
Large signs of PPD suggest support from Taiwan to an approach is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese believes that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "has already passed the point of no return."
Nominations for the Grammy. the jazz singer Spalding Hope is the choice surprise in the category of Artist disclosure.
She acts at the request of a president and maybe people will pay attention to you.
Hope Spalding, the bear and jazz singer of 26 years, personally chosen by President Obama to act in their ceremony of the Nobel peace prize 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination of high - level in the category of Best Artist Disclosure.
Spalding that has been acclaimed feature of the jazz from his album of 2008, "Hope," the nomination gives what to think, but respect the rules of the Grammys that it must be an artist who has not brought to market more than three albums before recording that "determines the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," certainly was a breakthrough and with its slight and pretty vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, may be at least set a distinction between Spalding and the way to the success of Norah Jones at 2003, the nearest equivalent for the voters of the Grammys, who lately have concentrated on jazz this category.
In other categories, the voters of the Grammy been rightly honour "Historicity" Trio Vijay Iyer, a wonderful and exciting disc that was one of the favorites last year.
Among the competitors of Iyer is the old saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and teclista John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favourite in New Orleans and regular guest on "Treme" of HBO, was honest in the category of contemporary jazz and the rest is considerably towards the merger as the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin Lorber and Jeff.
The savage punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society got a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against large jazz of chamber Ensemble Billy Childs and always dangerous Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways" it was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bear in their gang.

The proposed mosque in Temecula gains the approval of the legislation committee
The draft mosque for Temecula has the unanimous support of the local commissioning after more than five hours of testimony public, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying that it encourages terrorism and congestion.
However, the commission decided Wednesday at night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive of the aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, Christian and Jewish or baha'i, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of Temecula valley, on Thursday.
"The truth is that, as a us citizen, i am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Just speaking very high."
"In this valley there is wonderful people."
The meeting began six o'clock and lasted until almost midnight. most of the time it was given to people who interceded for or against the centre, virtually the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"The United States no longer exists," read one of the comments.
"It is another Planet of the apes with Mrs died Freedom in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans for the construction of an Islamic centres have led to protests in other parts of the country, including nearly zero area of New York where the attacks of 11, from 2011.
In Temecula Valley, the imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been live years without problems in Riverside county, but wanted more space and better than the warehouse leased to a property in shared with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new mosque in 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and it would rise to 43 feet.
It would take a surface area of 4.32 acres in Nicholas Road, about two miles to the east of the Chaparral institute.
Opponents can still use the project before the city Council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of their nutrients extends the possibility of finding new ways of life on Earth, and possibly other planets.
Although the researchers found the bacteria strange land here say it shows that it is possible that there are ways of life without the main elements deemed essential.
"This body has double capacity."
"It can grow with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very strange, although little needs to be a form of "foreign" real life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report in online edition on Thursday of Science publication.
For a long time, it is estimated that there are six major building blocks for life. carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that bacteria, found in Monkey Lake, California, could continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes You ask you what is possible," he said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, said the finding is important for the search for life on planets different from the Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognise life, to the point that it has.
The study focuses on a microbe land shortage.
However, the appeal of a press conference to discuss it, in that details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a lot of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report pointed to the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not.
What discovery "yes shows is that in a global environment, bodies could have used another elements to boost your biochemistry and that "standard" set of factors that we considered essential for life is not so fixed" said Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, Open University in Milton keynes, uk.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the replacement of an element of another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," he added Cockell.
The discovery was made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of astrobiology institute of NASA, which conducted the study focused on the Lake Monkey because it contains high arsenic levels.
The arsenic and phosphorus are similar in chemical terms, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one by one.
"The arsenic is toxic, especially because its chemical behaviour is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it may turn out to him difficult to the agencies to distinguish them."
"However, the arsenic is sufficiently different as such does not work as well as phosphorus, so between and, say, compresses the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Researchers found the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed to arsenic concentrations of older, they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorous, but the fact to show that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form can be natural to use arsenic, or in other areas of the Earth and another planet or moon where arsenic is the more common.
Jamie S. Foster, junior instructor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic by phosphorus can be replaced is not new, but had never been an example that showed that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the first eras of land, indicated why researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used.
"Yes it suggests there could be other ways to generate life, not just how life formed on Earth once," said Foster, who was not part of the research teams of Wolfe-Simon.
The inquiry had the support of NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs that they lacked in Compton
Dogs have been missing two of the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel, said the officers sheriff of the county of Los Angeles Thursday.
The four dogs of competition, two Akitas and two Pembroke welsh Corgi, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express light truck of 2006 in which they were spending the night in Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the canine ones recovered Wednesday afternoons and the two remaining Wednesday was late at night, according to informed Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the department of sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition."
"They have returned to its rightful owner."
Whitmore did not want to say exactly where the dogs were in the district or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is being carried out."
"We do not mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We are following any leads."
It was not possible to find the owners of dogs, Kristina and David Rickard Peek, so that they made some comment Thursday.
On Wednesday met in the afternoon with their two Akitas at an animal refuge of the county in Downey.
The assistants to the sheriff found the van both and dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, Akitas (paints, a dog for 3 years, and Didi, a dog for 10 months) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek tried to expose the powers of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of dogs, dying at night until Wednesday.
Rickard and Peek, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and wanted to expose to paints.
Other dogs were going to put them in other powers envisaged for the previous days to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to Peek out to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops tour of almost two months that the couple engaged in canine competitions.
Monday at night, Peek was Rickard and check-in the motel.
Normally they stay in motels and park the right van in front of the window of their room.
They led three other dogs (a young boxer of a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the courtroom of the motel.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very heavy coat and would be fresher.
They left the open windows slightly so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Rickard and Peek in the morning reported the theft of the van on Tuesday to six.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to the Corgis, of microchips identifying them.
Thursday was not clear if a reward or not they would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the reconstruction of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has got the green light finally start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan "prearmed" by creditors to delete approximately 5 billion dollars of debt, paving the way for the repair of 86 years focuses its efforts on production and openness of films and television programmes.
The failure of Thursday confirmed that the plan meets the demands of the code of American bankruptcy, why are not there other legal hurdles for MGM is relaunched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the chief executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to around 320.
In fact, MGM will not emerge from Chapter 11 to JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit of 500 billion dollars to fund the operations and production of new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating credit, which itself is contributing with 75 billion, and is expected to be funded in the middle of December.
The process of rebuilding the study began in may's of 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. it was contracted to provide advice on management to order their finances, while he fought to be able to make interest payments of 300 million dollars a year.
In the month of August, Executive Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Chairman of Enron and expert in recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Cooper and Moelis to resolve the financial tribulations of MGM and more than 140 creditors of the study, required time of expected much more.
After several months of discussions, by the end of the 2009 parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and no ready to pay more than 2 billion dollars that creditors sought.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while MGM team started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, finally was backed by creditors by the end of October.
Officially, when MGM leaves bankruptcy in the next few weeks, the Moelis companies and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has received 1.2 billion dollars, will receive a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
The Cooper companies, which have been collected 375,000 dollars per month for their services of directors of the company, will receive a "success fees" of 4 million dollars.
Birnbaum and Barber plan to resume production at MGM, which wore for the first time only one film this year, and collected an annual slate of seven or eight films that will leave in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to have a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies were not in agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance its budget for gifts
While iPad is the leading candidate to be the most wonderful plaything of this year, followed by, perhaps, videogame system Microsoft Kinect, both can mean a significant notch in their budget for gifts.
He believes that for the price of five iPad BMX bicycles 99 dollars can be bought each, and a Kinect game costs as 10 adorned with ancient jump rope with accounts, or approximately 48 cans of Play.
But there are ways to keep their gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three sellers of toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" us, and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the Law of Moore was working. technological toy of the year will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared with last year.
Moreover, while overall there are fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most experienced this kind, Webkinz and Penguin Club, have more supplies.
And toys powered by button batteries are growing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
There are some recommendations.
(All prices are in Toys "R" us unless stated otherwise).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13, for 3 years and more) are teddy toys as large as a guinea pig to sing a note when their bellies are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze starts to make a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it starts to tighten, it can not fail.
For song combined with dance Star Mickey, Dancing (Fisher-Price, 60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from the technology of Elmo Live last year, the animatrónico doll of 14 inches plays games of change as Simóm Given, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with caging device.
Children who proved the toy Mickey used as a dance instructor, while their parents complained about the lack of a gain control.
If you are a child of 80, she can remember Alphie, one of the first computerised educational toys.
It has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40, for 3 years and more), with a knapsack full letter questions designed to turn a walk into a car in a session with a notebook of ocurrente exercises autocorrection.
If you are reluctant to give your child, your smart phone, this will econtrará three separate options.
The MobiGo VTech (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years) is cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach so effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years), is the first major overhaul of the Leapster line, with a newer screen and brilliant.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
the Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, 3 to 7 years) uses a system of iTunes kind to submit electronic games and books and has a groove for SD cards that can visualize family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just larger than a box of matches, each with its own display LED.
The aim is to arm words put the blocks in row before time is running out. it is a formidable competition for an impromptu of armed with words.
They are increasingly toys that have some sort of connection in line.
Based on its presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Penguin Club.
In order to buy online to his son a mascot for the Penguin Club, for example, 2 Club Penguin" Mix "N can be a Disney Tournament Features Pack, (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you return the code online, your child gets enough credit in the shop of the Penguin Club for two articles.
These could include skates on wheels or a toy Puffle mascot.
Slightly bigger than give your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, 5 years ago and more) is the latest in a line of microrobots button powered by batteries.
The insect is moving quickly on 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It is amusing to make a maze of blocks to see if we can find the exit.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the table in the kitchen and even a pass in the mouths of our dog.
A more moderate side of maintaining order in China is promoted
As an urban investigating sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in place of the city, inspectors severely to the nervous people to their position, issuing orders in low voice for military service.
I wanted the female members of chengguan, the burly police in urban order of China, feared and scorned by his petulant forceful measures and their inclination to the violence, they should communicate a certain impression of a handful of spectators.
." Strong"
." Attention"
Show them, whispered, "how beautiful girls"
Four girls as soon as they passed the adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight trousers to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four placed perfectly elegant hats off the hair tied with blue and white buns stripped.
"Personally, i think that is a normal appearance," said Mr Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More a government it has treated to clean up the image of city inspectors in China.
A city ordered that all new recruits have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish color green uniform of the blue to the supposedly appeal.
Wuhan in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating eyes. at 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded the cart of snacks, and they constantly watched the frown gathered for half - an - hour, until the itinerant vendor picked up her things and he left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a change of radical image.
2003, The district has added to its urban police 13 women, specifically chosen by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the crude police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson and it should strive to increase the extremely small matter of China towards those hotbeds of the city.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officials are allowed only to enforce decrees of the city, imposing administrative fines and other penalties.
But the Chinese media reports portray a routinely different reality.
January of 2008, inspectors from the Hubei Province killed a passer-by blow after having used their cell to film them while they disbanded a protest against a landfill waste.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing, was stolen and published on the Internet, where it was described as whipping effectively to criminals without bleed them.
This year, a travelling salesman Shanghai watermelons suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A game of full video of violence, available to download online present inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street sellers.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication last year after controversy over tactics.
The journal called "a very thorough clean-up."
The sceptics say that the current approach is far from that.
After the district asked for through a warning eight new female recruits for October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if women had real homework or simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The warning from the district called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and five harmonious" facial features.
They must have a height above average, over 1.6 meters, or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25.
"His image is the important thing," said an anonymous civil servant from district to Rednet.com, a quasi government website.
"First, the external quality of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then there is the internal temperament "and skill."
Chengguan them they are women like flower pots, he said, and he added, "as well as flower pots, will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, assistant director of the office of administration of the city in the district, is not eager to support that description.
But it noted that the height requirements were standard on many Chinese warnings for both sexes.
The demand comes from harmonious facial features.
If this means to be good looking, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the disfigured handicapped or should not appear.
"We can not allow a person to a hunchbacked or is working here," said Mr Zheng.
"Their image would not be well."
Liu Yi, who police Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its red cheeks and lips subtly turns.
She does not think the emphasis on their side is sexist, said.
." You think I look sexy in this uniform" he asked with a sardonic eye.
His fellow worker dimpled, Xu Yang, 21, said "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to their time some work, he said, because they collected career ambitions larger than simply drive away to sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the swarm faces a dozen itinerant sellers more or less who send their foot or bicycle, trying to sell so many roles or bowls of tofú as possible before being thrown.
"Mr Wang, should leave."
." We have often said" the Xu young lady said while a vendor escaped on foot temporarily, leaving her car plunged by bicycle with vermicelli trimmings.
The officers describe their duties as monotonousser than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that fellow female authorities lack the power of their male ones to confiscate the cargo of the sellers.
They can only threaten denouncing the perpetrators his supervisors men.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, revolt after the false rumour that was scattered some chengguan officers had murdered a seller.
More than a dozen police or chengguan officers who were injured in the incident at night. 14 cars of the government were committed or set fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only two streets of calm Baoguang Plaza, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The authorities had seized a motorbike which was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a factory, as requires regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle grossly cried.
The case stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad side, they broke through for elbowing until their vehicles and would quickly go with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator for the male swarm, stayed behind, with its white standard given return to hide their behalf.
As female officers, the coordinators, men of 40 years or more, play a supporting role purely.
Unlike them, it is not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fought verbally."
"Sometimes we struggled physically," said Mr Li with complete naturalness.
"Most of the time it is the public who started the fight."
Prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign
Lawyers for senator announced Wednesday that prosecutors from the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of criminal charges that emerged from their affair with a former campaign worker and his efforts to secure work through the lobby to the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the legal threat more serious than it faces Ensign, Republican of Nevada was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair had national headlines last year and would damage his career.
The office of Ensign said he felt safe "pleased" by the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the ethics committee in the Senate.
Lawyers for Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of their investigation and does not have any plans to raise charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many advocates of ethics outside the Department of Justice, which said it seemed to be significant evidence to suggest that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobby.
The interviews, e-mail and other documents that were disclosed in the first place in a 2009 New York Times said that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobbying to get the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the matter of the senator with her.
Ms Hampton once worked as treasurer of the campaign for Ensign.
Ensign made contact with several patrons politicians to find a job Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Since Hampton had been recently an assistant, Ensign was excluded under the law to lobby their former employer or the Senate for a year.
The ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were friends close to the matter, appeared at odds with the door "revolving lobbying go," which seeks to restrict that former state employees use their connections to make personal business.
The evidence made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate the status of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While officials from the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed wary of accepting political trial after several major setbacks for its section on public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of misconduct of procedure.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," he said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"It basically means that government officials senior now assume that the laws are not enforced them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the top lawyer for Ensign, said in an interview that over the next day received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another appeal, saying that the department did not want to bring charges against his client.
The defence team of Ensign had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator in his office said in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments that gave prosecutors.
"I do not feel comfortable going into detail on my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal election Commission decided to change an investigation in a separate complaint with the ethics group, which alleges that a payment of 96,000 dollars for parents of Ensign to Hampton broke electoral federal law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to show that the money was a gift.
NV Energy is an important company in Nevada that had endured for so long the senator, who found a job through lobby with the help that Ensign, Hampton.
An e-mail sent to 2008 showed that after the company agreed to Hampton as lobbista, the head of the council of Ensign, John López, communicated with Hampton and he said he was "crushing" the Department Of The Interior on an issue in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another customer of Nevada, and Allegiant Air, and called on the transport secretary to setup a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had acquired Hampton to lobby.
When that first appeared in the news of the affair last year, Ensign called forgive him his constituents and relinquished his position as fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two Ensign weeks ago he told journalists who planned to postulate themselves to a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, Ensign announced that was no longer subject of a criminal investigation, said the senator had hoped that the ethics committee quickly followed the example of the Department of Justice and would conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has wishes to continue their hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of Cheshire will end at Twitter
There was half a dozen of them "chateando" in the ranks of the room.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, it says the defence, it had more than 140,000 messages from Twitter about the process that the violation addressed and children tied to their beds in a home that was set ablaze.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr Hayes submitted letters to the court that delineate the arguments of appeals that will probably take to the courts for years.
One of the most provocative says that the intense information about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by the massive journalists, created "a circus atmosphere" and such widespread and saturated with exaltadores immediate details made public passions exerted inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force the appeal judges to grapple with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the hall of the court.
"According to what I experienced during this process, i think that is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the hall of the court is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for the defence of Mr Hayes.
The court of first instance Blue Jon C., State Superior Court, laconically rejected the demands in failure last week, said that the news was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury has been taken by the passion.
But it probably will not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appeal courts have acknowledged that the coverage of cases you hold can generate questions about the fairness of the process.
In a historic failure of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the conviction of an osteopath in Cleveland, dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, versus Sheppard case. Maxwell, who was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television programme and the film "the fugitive."
Lawyers said that the court of appeals later examined the conviction of Mr Hayes half a century, may be intrigued by the argument that new rules would be necessary to control the form of the rooms of the court, something unimaginedable in the case of dr Sheppard.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" in processes of high profile, said John J. Donohue III, a professor in the School of Stanford law, which studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report said that this was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal would be intrigued by the idea of limiting the immediate communication from the rooms of the court she could make the proceedings were fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many issues delineated by lawyers for Hayes, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying implementation.
Lawyers for the defence also say that, for example, Hayes could be damaged when Judge Blue refused to allow them to the reactions of the potential juries would testearan, showing chilling photographs of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said they were shocked by pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Lawyers for the defence say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and maintain that the judge wrongly removed a jury who had criticized prosecutors and which incorrectly he had lobbied for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order him to the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The juries were not abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract the most interest.
They noted in a rejection of the verdict, filed last month that the event dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media routinely threw fuel to the fire of emotion on the case.
"The next agglomeration of tweets of course, the cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all state."
Its attention on the cover of Tweeter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that the immediate news they were more important than more slowly because the information was a vision ludita that would make the policy of the court on the cover was weak in future.
But some lawyers said the appeal courts often felt attracted by the arguments on adaptation that was required in court due to technological and social change.
Lawyers for Hayes are pushing for that claim.
In his writing, who referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which repeals the verdict of dr Sheppard due to coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case versus Sheppard. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility to a bridge to link the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week a little civility in Washington has been unleashed.
It is an omen of a genuine bipartisan or a future cooperation forged a swift return to the partisan fighting in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between president Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any breakthrough on the main issues that must be addressed during the session.
But why they say all, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of shared responsibility to govern rather than another empty episode to gain partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the deficit commission the president was also civilised, despite political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months created a mutual respect that extends the ideological gap that separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era has come from cooperation.
Now both sides are in a trial period, drilling each other to identify signs of cooperatism and compromise, as they try to assess the limits of the public and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
Which is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent assessments of the same on the part of the participants took control of an allegation or minimum requirements.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are deeply ingrained as suggesting that any rapid change in climate that existed during the past two years.
Or taxes, spending, healthcare or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
However, the election of November has relaxed mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed the way to say things," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration now at the centre of Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The elections arousing passion for, which are extinct.
That is good."
On some issues, in particular in which they appear on the agenda of the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The tax breaks for Bush expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, it is likely that there is a commitment to extend unemployment benefits, probably because the Republicans can not believe they are in favour of the tax breaks for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting Tuesday at the White House, there is greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the session, along with the ratification of the new pact for nuclear disarmament START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, noted that the successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing chair will not necessarily lead to an ongoing bipartisanism when new 112do. Congress meets January.
He said, however, that it is highly likely, and inevitable, that a period of disagreement.
"After the things that should be done, short-term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation" stated.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the politeness can lead to a true partnership.
"I see most of what happens between now and 2012 as a test for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the formation of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to their creation.
For more aware that they have the Republican leaders about the dangers to overstate its position, know they must try to fulfil his promises to cut the costs of the state and to repeal the new healthcare law.
Supporters lines are already seen clearly in the initial reactions against the commission's recommendations of deficits, including reform of the tax code and increasing some taxes and the retirement age and cutting costs.
The co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles was in charge of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to its own assessment, they were introduced to force the deficit in public agenda in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18 member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that number.
The biggest contrast is between the elected officials in, suggesting panel on fiscal issues has, at least for now, few bases or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the Republicans and the White House and Congress.
First the next year in the form of supporters clashes will happen when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and healthcare, followed soon by a more bipartisan cooperation.
What would bring about change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a standstill, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch closely the reaction of people.
Whoever they think it is probably lose will change course and will seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic vision.
The partisanship and polarization are now higher than they were in the middle of 1990, and seems to have more ideological gap between Obama and Republicanos of Congress which were among President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists in both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more momentous choice in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo that is this week can be welcome by many Americans.
But this will require efforts from both sides much more to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
A leaked u.s documents portrays Moscow as a paradise of corruption
The city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," and leaves a part of the bribes and protection money directly to collect the Kremlin, according to informed at the American Embassy in Russia.
It reported that both the police and the Federal Service handles huge Security systems of blackmail, which helps to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only legitimate business, but also organised crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power," takes its share of the money raises the level.
The letter, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blames it for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed for October, but there has been little evidence of improvement since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied the allegations of corruption over the years, and has won several demands by libel on such accusations.
September, when a Russian tv channel they asked him on a documentary that suggested was corrupt, said. "It is crazy, a lie, an inconvenience."
According to surveys, the Russians believe overwhelmingly that society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find explained details in detail, as they were in the report of the embassy, and is unbelievable that are the diplomats from a foreign country those who do that.
"Direct links in the city of Moscow with crime have taken some call it "dysfunctional," and say that the government works more like a kleptocracy than a government," he says the note.
"Criminal elements "krysha enjoy" (a term of the criminal world and Mafia which literally means "ceiling" or protection) that crosses the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (mbd), and the prosecutor, as well as all sectors of the tape of the city of Moscow.
"Researchers identify a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, mbd and the militia is the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide any services."
The report says that the SFS collects money from the largest companies and the police it ends at retail stores.
A source, said the report, "it explained that business owners in Moscow understand that the best thing is to get the protection of mbd and SFS (instead of the groups organized crime) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power that criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"Consequently, protection against the criminal gangs is not more of a priority."
The letter notes that while the money collection is complete, protection can be patchy. those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed by a guise or another.
Medvedev spoke several times on the fight against corruption, but it has confessed he has made little progress.
The note from the embassy report on men carrying suitcases, probably full of cash, in the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev should trust the bureaucrats" said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But it is a part of the bureaucracy."
"It does not belong to a political class, because no longer a political class in Russia."
Without the policy without opposition, separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimated that corruption costs to Russia over 300 billion dollars per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by Transparency International ngos, the country was ranked number 154 (the countries are classified as fewer most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the American Embassy, this did not happen until late at night - hour in Moscow, will surely cause unhappiness within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed on the weaknesses of Moscow, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin claims that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed person to Cnn by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously on a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called it Batman and Robin Medvedev.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that would have taken control of such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, that was done so immoral way."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge to face the past
In a classroom concrete lit, weakly with stained walls and descascaradas, the director of Secondary School Anlong Veng recalled the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Khmer Rouge.
"Here all Ta Mok love."
"It was a good leader and he worried about its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the khmer rouge commander, remains popular in this remote former strength of the Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia, where she built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, loyalty had for a long time is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims who have publicly people who had participated in the scheme.
June, the government distributed a textbook of secondary school that teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to the children of its former soldiers.
July and a hybrid court of the United Nations and Cambodia sent the first sentence of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the notorious torture centre Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better - known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, the anxiety has grown among veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng, have complicated efforts for reconciliation and his attempts to return to the Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge, but they can not do anything," he said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent body to investigate the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of hunger, disease or excessive work, approximately 1.7 million people.
1979 When the vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the rest of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia border with Thailand.
They launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movement that surrendered to 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary who led the guerrilla war from their bases in mountains and forests in western Cambodia, Ta Mok worked followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of 90, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the first democratic elections in the country in 1993 large groups of soldiers from the Khmer Rouge began to desert towards the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary, 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes at 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 Dangrek the nearby Mountains.
He died in prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Khmer Rouge fell in abject misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few officials from elite of the Khmer Rouge retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, the privates remain poor, unskilled farmers.
"These people have found few benefits after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, providing public forums across Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were bred with no concept of doing business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge when she was a teenager at 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a farmer from poor rice in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was well," he said.
"Ta Mok received to eat at all."
"But life is hard because we have autoabastecernos."
The current court of the Khmer Rouge has also caused concern here.
Early next year, it is expected that the court begins to process to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court is to prosecute the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but has not said whether it will pursue cases in those four.
This is not served as a calming fears in Anlong Veng much.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district officer in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge at the end of 1970.
At 2007, she told investigators the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that had overseen the building of the dam Thma Trapeang, a project about what she thinks they have killed thousands of workers forced.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass Im Chaem, refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
He said that if the court announced it would not appear.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime minister Hun Sen, who deserted by the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also has warned repeatedly that there will be unrest if the court seeks more suspects, although experts and historians question.
"Cambodia have to dig a hole and bury the past" stated.
But to confront the past is exactly what Cambodia have to do to advance, said Youk Chhang, of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to return to the broken pieces" stated.
"It is our duty to meet these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "History of Democratic Kampuchea" of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng June as a supplement to the textbook history of secondary school in the Ministry of Education, which only contains four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the link of the city with the regime.
Valeak touch, 19, a student at the Secondary School in Anlong Veng, said that the new textbook helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But their parents reacted with scepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the court and textbook" she said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the amount of people that the court will process."
Such resistance has caused the reconciliation process is complex and difficult Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to have an impact, said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a potent charm.
Dangrek in the Mountains, a route with too many weeds and covered in plastic bags rejected lead to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusting tin plate ceiling.
The body of Pol Pot was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Sothea Nuom, 31, a salesman cell on the edge of the road, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated.
"But it has a strong spirit and many of the place to go there," she said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day i decided to go until the last vestiges of Pol Pot, where it would leave a ripe banana handful of hope have good luck.
Belarus agreed to relinquish its stockpile of uranium for weapons described
In a surprise victory for the campaign of president Obama to safeguard nuclear material around the world, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that will relinquish their pool of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treatment was developing a joint statement issued after the Foreign secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton met with belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, plus a security summit.
For years, the u.s government had been trying to persuade Belarus he renounced its highly enriched uranium and appeared that they had reached a point of no return the spring.
But us officials told the Washington Post that both done a couple of operations classified with Belarus in recent months to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium for weapons, described a belarussian installation of investigations.
This paved the way for agreement on Wednesday to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke of anonymity because of the secrecy.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcome of the Summit on Nuclear Safety of 47 nations led by Obama April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good deal to secure the invitation former Soviet republic to the next summit 2012.
"I really feel fascinated because they wanted a place in the Summit on Nuclear Safety of 2012."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
April of 2009 Obama promised in Prague around the world to protect all vulnerable nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the u.s government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on Nuclear Safety of Obama, the belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what basically uranium described for weapons) and low-grade uranium enrichment" Lukashenko said then.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to be sold them to anybody."
"We used It for research purposes, is everything."
However, Belarus brought the United States a few months ago, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly difficult because the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended Monday and was conducted by plane.
The us government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to give Belarus the installation of investigations in low-cost uranium enrichment, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a civil servant from the Department of Energy that works in reducing Global Threat, said that this was a coordinated and orchestrated very careful to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies found this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium for weapons, described as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve to 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh crackdown on Lukashenko of human rights.
But wednesday's statement suggesting a potential thaw.
It was stated that "while progress on these issues of global security are welcome, america and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and is essential for progress of the country and its people."
The Spanish Government did not make repairs to the cia flights
The Spanish Government did not make repairs to the cia flights with prisoners taliban and al - qaeda in the direction of Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram the ambassador in Madrid.
The documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to El País newspaper reflect it, where is it added that the deputy first minister, María Teresa Fernández De La Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive was reported for "being able to prove that they had proper monitoring foreign aircraft across Spain."
June of 2006, after a report by the Council Of Europe in which it accused of complicity in anti-competitive practices human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez of the Fertile Valley.
The vice - president acknowledged that the council's report "had led to the Zapatero Government offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on this issue.
"The Fertile Valley underlined that Spain has no qualms flights of information through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be told to" avoid "to be caught off guard," links Aguirre in a cable.
Then also foreign title, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, he told the ambassador that the Spanish Government "wanted to give this profile as low as possible, although being in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited influence."
On the other hand, January of 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez told the Embassy that would not try to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of documents from the National Inteligencia centre (CNI) and the ministry of Defence on cia flights
"These reports do not contain any incriminatory element or any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the us expressed their concern at the "apparent co-ordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors German," rather than by the declassified information from the CNI or the ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate efforts to handle the case between Governments quietly," laments Aguirre.
In 2007 in a lunch between the ambassador to the us and minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, said that "although the Spanish judges are jealous of rabidly their independence and will do what they see fit," he had instructed his staff "so that they avoided comments from inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses concern for the pp in this matter.
"Despite their pro-american general direction, our experience suggests the pp will not hesitate to capitalizing any indication that the Zapatero Government had deliberately or ignored actions of the us that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the us Government" stress.

The people's party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the pp could be decisive in the communities of Tarragona, Lérida and Barcelona
After a significant increase of fellow votes and experienced in recent regional elections, the Catalan pp or has a view on the generals then, is progress or not, the outlook is more positive as the number of votes this training gets in those elections tend to double that it receives in Catalans.
So popular the Catalans won 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the autonomous ones of 2006, the number rose to 316.222.
The past Sunday, the CFP got 384,091 votes.
Continue this trend to rise has been fuelled a shipment of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the pp, analysts of this training have calculated that if a general election were held, the CFP could happen from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose 9 members (he has 25).
These calculations would state that the Catalan place is essential for pp and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people's party, ERC would lose a member - now he has three, while ICV would remain a member or would win.
But to keep the election timetable, the immediate appointment will take place during May of 2011 municipal elections, where popular ones can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in four capitals of his province and highlighted the head of the Delegation of Barcelona, one of the governments that uses more budget - 661 billion Euros for 2011.
Nationalist and popular they agree that the PSC losing councils in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get majority nor possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable that this training is losing its representation in Barcelonian Town Hall - you need to win 5% of the votes.
The pp has increased its number of votes in four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are confident of being able to perform the angry tarraconense in the capital, where they governed with the pp before the current socialist mayor, Josep Felix Crossbowmen.
In Lérida, the pp has been only 500 votes of the PSC, the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintain good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, were on several occasions.
Popular ones have also grown in other major cities, like Badalona Castelldefels or Reus.
At the moment, the pp is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of people.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al - qaeda
Besides the seven arrested in Barcelona, in Thailand, there were three
Seven pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the Overall Police Station Information from the Police in Barcelona made up a jihadist cell that led from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al - qaeda, including "the Tigers for the Release of the Tamil eelam (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba (Let), the author of this latest one of the attacks in Mumbai that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Interior ministry has given great importance to these investigations, to ensure that the "operation" Kampai has been "weakened" team of counterfeiting of Al - qaeda at international level and, therefore, its operational capacity."
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years that have been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were fake and then distributed to groups that make up the galaxy Al - qaeda for their "combatants" can cross the borders and other western countries with impunity.
The destamantelada cell is not the only one to jihadist network was operating in Europe, so in investigations they have participated, alongside thai services, other European police units, so i do not rule out that EU blows similar to the one at night on Tuesday in Barcelona are the last played in the coming days.
In coordination with this operation (pakistanis Junaid Humayun were arrested, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Mohammad Ahmad, Saddique Khan Begum, Arshad Tanveer and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand was developed to another with the capture of pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were those that run from Bangkok to the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stolen passport to tourists that complied with the requirements set by "against" the global Islamic call.
That is to say, the documents had to be on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 years, with a valid for several years and printed without visas.
In the research highlighted that has not been any data that binds the arrested in Catalonia with the attack on Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba, has been one of recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth remembering that days before he committed this attack from Catalonia were sent through an agency transfers of thousand dollars "were put" on the card purchase of mobile phones which were then used by members of the "command" which killed 106 people.
Police have seized from extensive documentation.
The pp requires But parks tax concert
The leader of the CFP, Alicia Sanchez-Camacho, had personally yesterday to Artur Mas their conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Catalan Autonomous Government, identical to those already raised during the campaign and short on prioritising recovery of the economy and doing without adventures edge-pro-sovereignty henchmen, as is the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the Equator in office.
The president of popular Catalans went to the meeting with Artur Mas security that it gives have got 18 members in the elections Sunday, no more than enough to be done, because the CiU candidate needs that at least one of which will be abstaining opposition in the investiture vote.
On the possible restrictive practice with the pp future alliances are that the nationalists want to stay in Congress when general elections are held, but at the moment, talks to keep these days But with the other political leaders are in Catalan key.
And where the president of the pp, to support an investiture "it will be necessary to park all sovereignists speeches and independence," as well as economic agreement - similar to the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even tries to put to referendums.
Both leaders have shared their bid to thin political apparatus of an autonomous administration very bloated and the elimination of inheritance tax and donations.
The details of the negotiations on the investiture otherwise they will take care of the CFP, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But that has met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta Solidaritat (Catalans).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not for "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot do not rule out that his vigilant killed more than 11 elderly
The makers of geriatric the Caritat in Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution criminal behaviour of Joan I Saw it Dilmé, the nurse who while there was used killed at least eleven elderly he had his position.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer for the centre, lawyer Joan Gorge, and announced that "the desire of the Caritat should be able to exercise the accusation against the person in charge" of the deaths but the legality and responsibility forced us to take legal situation of officials responsible."
And it is that in addition to the loss of prestige that may suffer the organisation for not detected in time the criminal activities of the guardian, the major threat to the Caritat now receives substantial forms of compensation that is already counting the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Saw it Dilmé has admitted that the first crime goes back to August of 2009 and since then has not stopped killing.
The judge suggested already in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of geriatric - who suspected in many cases no doctor personally explored the dead, but the age and the pathologies of patients, released the process by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, vehemently denied this and pointed out yesterday that "the lack of measures may not have been at any moment the cause of what happened."
The lawyer for the Caritat added that "cause there is no indication that was a reckless action on the part of any person who is not the one charged."
Already described as "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders a day before yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed by the 29 of August of 2009, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case an insulin overdose caused the deaths of puncturing, unlike the first crime that made it helping itself from a mixture of sedative tablets.
The director of the Caritat notes that it is difficult to control that staff from the centre has access to medicines.
The punctures insulin and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine offences that the nurse, in their eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to give death.
But the tests are done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Saw it does not lie and looking for its first victims a less cruel death or burnt, giving them inside them bleach and has already confessed to do with the three women who died between 12 and 17 of October.
In the Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of vigilant, even on the number of murders confessed that do not rule out that it is higher, and justify its position in the different versions in I Saw it in his visits the court and in little felt which he changes his way after having successfully made eight murders.
It is why they say they are put at the disposal of justice to clarify the extent of this event.
The ecb is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday, Trichet warned that "markets do not underestimate our ability to react."
The differences in peripheral have closed strongly and the actions of the European banks have raised more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ability of the ecb to be wrong and the Euro has scarcely begun to appear a worrying sign.
What has taken place yesterday is an unliquidated market falls as recovers but motivated by closure of short and very speculative positions.
Institutional investors will take in losing the fear.
A month ago the ecb said to us today to withdraw liquidity measures and he will have to go back tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those.
The Bundesbank required to complete the purchase plan inefficient national debt by and removing all the extraordinary liquidity measures on credit and leaving only unrestricted access to week.
After the Irish crisis we hope they extend the current liquidity measures "to swing" and at least maintain the quarterly auction with unrestricted access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that they continue with its programme of bond purchases and that signals to intensify.
If they do not meet the expectations they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if you are blinded in withdrawing liquidity measures attending that God!
A meeting of May in which they said that they had not seen the bond purchase and the markets crumbled, history could be repeating itself.
The ecb must be credible and persistent.
In case it announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday said that it had bought much, causing a collapse of the market.
The auction of letters a year in Portugal has been very poor yesterday.
Only the Treasury issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a clear change in market sentiment after the comments from Trichet.
In Ireland, it has become public figures from the hole from Allies and Bank Of Ireland.
The figures are about 10,000 million short term and 15,000 other potentials and to February to obtain private capital or will be nationalised.
If Ireland does not have any credibility after not detect the problem was with the stress test, the figures are achievable within the Plan for Aid and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has still not enough support, so Ireland remains uncertainty centre.
Angela Merkel is measured tone of his speech to ease the tension for the next Summit of Heads Of State and Government 14 of December that a political compromise is necessary to show that we are a union and that everyone has the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity yesterday when presenting the plan of action that will approve the Cabinet on Friday.
The pension Reform, financial transparency in autonomous regions and organisations, reducing the deficit, deregulation, privatization, measures to revive the use sounds in the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual effect ZP Trichet and explain that the spaniard has risen to 4.5%, double that of other European Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the impact surprise.
There is now a key auction of a link to three years that will benefit by Trichet effect so we expect it to be solved by strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability of refinancing.
Spain to request an Aid Plan would be a autoinmolación.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has three times more than 40,000 million in liquidity found that way, the most expensive rates and closes access to markets indefinitely.
However, the strategy must remain the woman in the Caesar, "as well as it seems.
Spirit, we can.
The president of Eulen will oppose meeting Sicily the Fertile Valley asked for their children
The weather does not slow in the conflict open in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and Juniper.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will contest, when zero "in full," the court meeting of the Juniper next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and who will try to assert its majority and take control of management bodies of the signature title of Wineries Vega Sicily.
David Alvarez and his children Jesus, Mary and Joseph are sharpening the legal battery for the new legal chapter in their dispute over control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services company does not seem ready to give up their dispute to be present in the control systems of the Juniper.
Its board was dismounted by five of his seven children who appointed administrators in the house of shareholders of 18 for January this year and whose opposition is noted in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of the Juniper next day 16, convened by the magistrate of Commercial Number 2 in Madrid, has opened the box of thunderclaps in the family Alvarez.
Using the judge set the house is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that ensures the appeal of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta, and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a desperate appeal as applicants their five children, through procedural hair-splitting clear, fraud and abuse Act, to try to confirm and adjust the radically zero meeting of 18 of January, according to its official mouthpieces.
This argument will be the basis for once held the meeting, it suits their opposition considering that it is "zero" full.
The same actors who have a discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate June convened a meeting.
In the Juniper, heritage society and holders of Wineries Vega Sicily, including active, the seven children of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service the protests, however, the usufruct about 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the basic question must decide after the judge is hearing on the request of opposition, for which there is no target date.
Red Bull prevails in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in cars in real - time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 at 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
Nobody initially considered the options from a motor-racing team just arrived and, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, past November, in the run-up to the championship all backed the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without finally being below capacity as the pilot of the champion, germany's Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, the world of Formula 1 "secret weapon" has not become a legend that Siemens multinational has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is in fact a simulation software processes that German put on the market in 2007 with purposes far removed from the automobile competition.
So-called plm, this powerful computer science instrument was used around the world to design production lines of manufacturing factories, power plants, tools for high accuracy.
The aim is to reproduce, to simulate of faithful way the product or the process before building it real mode, avoiding this avoidable failures and expenses.
Plm has provided the development of the Canon cameras, the Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous self-serving Nissan cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that this computer science instrument at its factory in Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull to design and take effect "in a few hours, almost in real - time," the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the motor-racing teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during every season.
In the team Red Bull 180 professional young people of highly skilled work today, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse project all kinds of changes in bolides.
The manager of Siemens explained that plm software is able to assess and improve all aspects of bolides of Red Bull except the driver of the whole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, the aerodynamics and safety elements change.
The changes can be made less than virtual reality simulator the reality in 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems by laser and sterilizers of high-tech.
The only limitation of this folly of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars each team of Formula 1 can spend more in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a village about 50 kilometres from London.
It is two buildings in restricted visits, especially for journalists.
" Everything is considered "highly secret."
The group promotes this 580 people, including the two pilots, Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 Red Bull is certainly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the vast technological resources that the hallmarks of energy drinks has called for its participation in circuits, other players hide the contest is invaluable and zero visibility.
The head of technology from the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress of R&D in cars of carts contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the remainder.
Today these percentages have changed and technology adds 85% to success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the value - added.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computer because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install two years, 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive store in collaboration are your partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 metres square that multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will reconcile this with the 16 already areas in centres marker as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and the English Cut.
The vice - president of HP Spain, Greek Herrero, as an example the remodelled store located in major Barcelonan, Pont property Reyes, who works for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to put 200 items of brand sales in Europe 2013 strategy that includes 20 Spanish settlements.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona is the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible overtures, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
Also the director of the personal systems HP ensured that philosophy to install shops will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the industry.
The American group adviser and is in charge of the exclusive mobile design of the shops (with products that can be touched of interactive form) - Europe will have an identical picture.
In addition, HP covers training with the staff to settlements.
Greek Herrero denied that he was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses trying "to improve the service to customers and medium-sized companies in buying, after-sales care, and even the packaging."
The Barcelona store covers an area with a pioneering pilot programme globally which is responsible for resolving the problems of computer equipment to ensure HP.
Online service connects with a technical centre, located in Maastricht (Holland).
"In 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for small and users because large companies already have contracted services for technical assistance," Greek Herrero said yesterday.
Bookmakers Sabadell "stealing" a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, fellow adviser Sabadell Bank, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but scrapped initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the end of the war of liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be trying to offset partially by increases in committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to catch in three years a million customers, particularly its outstanding issue.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and to survive in difficult economic environment.
The bank will launch 2011 new plan director who will have a job for three years.
The aim, as well as surviving without recourse to public support of the FROB, is to gain market share with the recruitment of a million new individual customers -700,000 discount if they can leave the bank, its major unresolved issue, because it had pampered more to small businesses and to retail customers.
This year has captured 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in more than 10% companies.
One of the bases of plan 2011-2013 is the focus on productivity, or of austerity, with cost reduction target, and whose challenges will exhibit the bank when the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare these days to set targets and to make them public since the financial crisis has upset the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year, its Optimum director plan, set for four years, although initially it was three, but the markets was that an exercise will extend it further.
Customers who leave their savings banks will be their main goal.
At a breakfast hosted by the APIE Guardiola, it insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and momentous year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," essential for the survival of banking business, called.
And although it believes the war of liabilities - that penalise banks is shrinking, the price of risk premiums who are paying banks and boxes for their emissions to achieve liquidity are moving at the cost of credit to offset the drop in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and will be a factor pressure on credit."
"We have not closed the tap, but the differences are higher" said Guardiola.
Banesto already issued on Thursday to its network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of spreads - to see CincoDías of 22 and 27 of November.
It also recognised that the bank is now "to raise fees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The plan director of Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Indeed, it ensures that in Spain "they are going to require larger sizes."
"Next year is going to move everything," he said.
It says that the capital needs are "raised" lots and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution into the red.
And he notes that the FROB can replace the market in the recruitment of new funds before recapitalizations.
After that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it reduced importance which some bankers predict like a liquidity crisis.
It says that it can not be issued, but unlike June, it is possible to achieve short-term financing through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The MINT scrapped a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The director - general of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of mergers of savings banks is going to take place and returned to highlight the speed with which the restructuring is implemented.
When he took the concentration of Spanish savings banks, several organizations that were assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to happen.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has become, Cajasol to the group of Civic Bank can not be said that it is a second round, which are adjustments."
"Most is completely done. perhaps instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all great processes have become and had the charge by the Bank of Spain, which has worked very many also" said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast Manager of the Association and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the merger process is being undertaken "as quickly as possible, and we should be very happy with how it is taken place in terms that at the time, not now, they were set in the business plans by the Bank of Spain," highlighted.
"To go from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17, with 75,500 million it is a process that unparalleled in history, reducing the number of organisations by 62% for much bigger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "a number of opinions rather unfortunate is slow process" show "a lack of seriousness and respect," because "what the Bank of Spain is to remember that we must be within the term before the end of the year."
The director - general of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, claimed yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system across Europe and "probably," and attributed to those who calls it into question a "lack of knowledge."
The manager said that in the current economic climate, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks - a system which has launched a "major" process of concentration and "it goes to quickly as possible."
It also agreed that the Spanish bank came out staging the stress tests that the ecb was made.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the Euro, but it has set the conditions for all Union.
Tensions in the markets have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax cuts to small, regulation of the private placement agencies or removal of the 426 Euros of aid to the unemployed without profit, the privatization of AENA 49%, management of Barajas airports and the Prat and 30% of Lotteries.
On the other, Elena Salgado, with the support of former Felipe González, has added to the criticism of the cancillera Angela Merkel for her responsibility in untying the current crisis.
How is it necessary to interpret these movements?
It goes without saying that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its forthcoming policy.
On the contrary, it is another round of nut in the difficult process of redefining the Euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what should be their future, which hits to keep the old traditions of much of its partners.
Against the resistance, Germany begin to speculate on the three possible exit to the crisis.
First, a strong Euro, by itself, Austria and Holland, among others, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
Second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a current of opinion very good, almost 50% of the population.
Third, a redesign of the Euro, in line with the Germanic proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for transgressors, possible suspension of payments, some of them and extension to the private sector of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been for a long time to define itself, so now apologies do not fit.
First, on 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission encouraged deficits, the German Government removed from the chest of a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought it had become (plans fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what their European partners were playing, including France.
Second in the forehead the Central - European country when it was painfully extended Merkel's decision to rescue Greece.
Then it was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published it was very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel it emerges with a clear position, demanding reform of the treaties, to the rescue of a country, and at the same time, forcing private lenders to bear some of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and all the others.
But his proposal, although slightly sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we would have to attend the process of reforming the Union that allows those measures as 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to go.
And it is telling us all that while there are now taking action that does not quite as of that date the operation of the Euro, will have been completed.
2013 Will mark the birth of a new monetary area, where the countries severely offenders will be punished, may be forced to declare its suspension of payments and in that case the private sector will also bear some of the cost.
Germany is showing us that we should follow a path of growth with high savings rates and foreign investment, moderation in alcohol consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, as has chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, is simply not going to tolerate.
The drive is clear.
And we would do wrong in not understanding it.
It is not just tried to restore the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they claim is a much stronger.
And the worst in these circumstances we could do is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence open the way for greater tranquillity.
And that we take the window of opportunity that you have given us until the spring of 2013.
It seems that mr Zapatero has also realized it, and its obvious double (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with big business and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism to Merkel, has opened the theory that is to get at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it does not seem that they are going to move.
And among the possibilities are considered to be too stuffed currency zone of frivolous countries, can not be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that he had warned us.
Fraud and sport bill
Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show ingenuity but will not escape a fine.
The expulsion allegedly plotted by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) party contested November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused who are drawn red rivers about whether such behaviour is unsportsmanlike or not and, possibly, both players had to be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well - known, for want of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team clearly knew livestock), both players deliberately wasting time to draw both lack the referee showed a second yellow card.
That way, and as Real Madrid will end up as leader of his party, both players they will meet regulatory sanction the next party of minor league against Auxerre, and will be able to go clean of cards to the next stage.
Finally, the committee of discipline of UEFA has dealt with two parties coach of the team, José Mourinho, and with different economic quantities of those involved players.
The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this is not a new practice, but more frequent in the world of football.
He is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the book written, but not followed in this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case is because it has been carried out by a team from the organization of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presumes of nobility and honour, and sometimes happened has fined his players by similar events) and orchestrated dramatisation, apparently, by Mourinho, which adds an episode more his long history of theatric and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around if that kind of behaviour expressly prohibited by the rules do not contradict the principles of sport, i.e, if this law is made. then, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sporting regulations, but they seem to avoid its direction.
The issue is to examine the kind of damage that causes the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that understand the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, that these actions did not jeopardise, there was no violent game.
Another of those goods that are made with the play is to prevent team of players offenders is unfairly of the team, something that did not happen either.
However, the ironic thing about the performance of the players from Real Madrid is that it did not comply with what we normally characterised as a trap or fraud of law because its violation of the rules was not made secretly trying to avoid the penalty, but their actions intended to be the most obvious way to receive the punishment of the referee.
They expected and they accepted the sanction with pleasure.
Another question is what kind of advantage gets offenders in examined deliberate lack.
Here it seems necessary to state that it is not placed at a disadvantage, nor will benefit from the same party, because clearly the result of the action is to leave the team with fewer players.
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next party, because the club will not be able to have those players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten his participation in future divided.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination because the team can be eliminated first shift, and that the players meet a penalty and the second cycle of cards, where the suspension by card accumulation occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, my rounds, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Those actions do not really go against the spirit of sport, so is to make strategic decisions that they favour to make the most of what they allow the rules.
If it holds, the players did not act to evade the implementation of sanctions (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), but rather choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing for punishment or fleeing.
Although the border between the mind and the law is unclear on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy seems to me, created by two factors: because this was two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which the transmission of the directive did to cause them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical and aesthetic.
Offering offensive to capture Christmas dinners of THE groups
The dictatorship of the calendar turns this year an avalanche of stocks for 16 and 17.
The celebrations autosufragadas by employees proliferate, who want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros.

Pakistan's nuclear programme generates big concern in the us
Islamabad has nuclear weapons to a "faster than any other country.
The leaking of Wikileaks confirm links between taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American embassy in Pakistan and the State Department leaked us by the Wikileaks website confirms the enormous concern that the pakistani nuclear program brings in Washington.
Besides illuminating and substantial offer details on the content of the talks and the thoughts of the reputable American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, instead of rising, "sinks," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a rate faster than any other country in the world."
The particularity of pakistan's nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled but they remain stored for components to hinder its destruction in case of attack. chicago it is one of the main reasons of efforts in Washington.
The ambassador sets in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a previous report to the visit of then the advisor on National Security, James Jones. "The proximity of some nuclear plants territory under attack taliban, the rumoured spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes, is not just for us, but also by Russia, as proliferante and reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities. given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear programmes of missiles or," the expert Yuri Korolev said, the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with their american counterparts.
Most novel of the documents leaked by the portal of Julian Assange is decreasing cooperation between the us and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and senior pakistani rate of production of nuclear weapons.
A embassy in case, which describes as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, maintains. "Transparency is often nonexistent. the offers of aid are unanswered or are ruled out."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of National Intelligence for south Asia, state that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan has nuclear weapons at a rate faster than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, general Ashfaq Kayani, which makes it "very clear" responsible "the Army of Pakistan must end the tacit support of terrorist groups."
The hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints the head of the anti-terrorism fight to prevent further leaks.
INTERPOL has a red alert to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
All that with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated maze where it is difficult to know about the facts.
INTERPOL yesterday issued a "red alert" for "locating and following the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, she is not new, but it dates from 20 of November.
And it does not have to do with recent leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents from the USA but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, claims that "police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
It was day 20 when the international police force with headquarters in Lyon (France) issued the order to request of Sweden, but did not disclose until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities in that country.
So the 188 countries of INTERPOL have evidence to identify or locate Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition."
Although INTERPOL can not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many Member States has explained the organization, called the network out free rein to come to an arrest chicagoit must take the national police force, especially if they have a bilateral agreement on extradition, as is the case in Sweden and Britain, where it believes it is Assange.
The movement are outraged lawyers Assange, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the founder of Wikileaks, 39, was prepared to be responsible for videoconferencing to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also point out that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Beria, Pavlovich head of Stalin.
"This seems a hunting, not a legal persecution," denounces the letter.
As the world seeks - and from Australia her mother defends the innocence of her sonchicago Assange remains in whereabouts unknown, but not shut up.
From Monday given an indeterminate place an interview to the editor of the magazine Time via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State in the us, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for the American diplomats who spied on the UN tried violated international that the us has signed, it should resign."
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary for the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
"I am not entirely sure why the opinion of a kind with a website should concern us," he told channel Cnn.
Obama himself has ordered a senior officer of counter-terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document flights.
The attempt of the spokesman for president Barack Obama to belittle Assange contrasts with views that these days conservative politicians and commentators say.
Peter King, the congressman who as for January will chair the Committee on National Security in the House Of Representatives, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including in the Wikileaks list of terrorist organisations "to intervene and its funds and to prosecute those of any contribution or help."
Further, Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian president Stephen Harper has gone, who has had to backtrack after saying that Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should make it aim to use an airplane not manned or something."
He did not apologise was Mike Huckabee, a baptist minister, exgobernador of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"He is in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be too gentle penalty," he said on Fox chain.
Puigcercós seeking peace in the ERC with winks relatives by marriage to Carod
The republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot on his continuity.
Huguet proposes a plural executive and the end of the asambleario system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth internal revolt in the ERC ranks, without north by the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware that its threat of resignation is insufficient for the relatives of marriage when exlíder Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of that sector today is so watered - down as its own mentor and absolutely can be concerned that he had with other defunct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win the new critics winks that allow you to shield themselves until local elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national directors of ERC will be able to vote on their secret continuity.
Through problems and not of hands.
If the carodistas want to carry a vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do it without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the division image as much as submission to him.
In several interviews, it said it would not be considered ratified half plus one of the vote, but added, without specifying percent, a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good.
Next to Carod require the president more than to put their position at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós controls the upper body between congresses.
But by not having sufficient majority to force resignations, they are going to try to agree with implementing a roadmap between now and May.
For this, they hope to participate in drafting the document strategic reorientation that the board will vote on national boards day 18.
Its purpose is to assure Puigcercós in exchange for which it promises to push congress to autumn 2011, which already provides leadership for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" undermine the stability and that its aim is to do that, once and for all, the organisation is unable to wash the dirty linen door internally.
In this vein, is symptomatic of the article that the minister in office Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
Think of the Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació gave assuming that the leader will be signed "in exchange for various objectives."
It listed five, they highlight two.
First, "recompose" the executive to represents 90% of the militancy at least, i.e, to include new faces from the associated Carod industry.
The second can be big news.
Huguet ERC suggests that once asambleísmo removing the mechanism as operation.
It calls for a reform of the statute that allows for the conference by delegates elected.
The asambleario model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has campaigned here in the past two congresses.
In fact, the troubled conclave of 2008 the order to the asambleísmo reviewed in a specific congress to reform statutes.
This nomination is pending, because the tide of recent years, advised against address the issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, it can be a good time to return to it and try to close it for good.

National leader of the PAN detailed the former PAN leader is his right to go to the National Order to protest what is right.
National leader of the PAN, Caesar Nava Vázquez, assured that the ouster of Manuel Espino Barrientos became attached to the legality and the former PAN leader is his right to go to the National Order to protest what his right does.
In previous interview to the capture of protest Monteagudo Gabino Cué as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Hawthorn is a decision made at the local level.
"It is an independent Commission decision of Sonant Order."
"Mr Espino has a right to go, where appropriate, via complaint to the Commission of the National Council, so that is a decision taken in the context of a body responsible," he wrote.
On the other hand, it clear that it is not time to think about 2012 and was never in the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened internal election next 4 and 5 for December, which will be choosing to his successor.
"That (an alliance of 2012) that was never on the table, at least not for now, it was an approach for the local election that was successful and met the target," he said.
The PAN leader needed to the PAN 71 years of dialogue behind it, so it does not scare internal competition; the bill "we enjoyed it and it strengthens us" limited.

"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón. they begin to defend. that leaves clóset" stated.
He thought that the owner of the federal Executive can make such as did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no jaw far from censorship.
It promotes Obama on Twitter law in favour of undocumented students
"If you agree to approve the law Dream Act is appropriate, it calls on your senators and encourage them to adopt is legislation," tweeteó the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today added to the national demonstration in support of the law Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree to approve the law Dream Act is appropriate, it calls on your senators and encourage them to adopt is legislation," tweeteó Obama.
His brief message to open a cyber liaison with a document broader asks the public to communicate instantly with the senators since the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote to delay occurs early, now is the time to make your voice heard."
The message was disclosed after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless the extension of tax cuts from the Bush era and the financing of the government.
Such blockade, announced in a letter signed by all 42 republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects like the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Challenged by republican blocking the law Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once determined the tax issue, will be set a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I think there is a very long time..."
"We all agree that we should solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement that at some point and then we can plan for the future of the rest."
The leader of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that it would request a vote to close debate" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on Thursday in the Senate, although next week is more likely.

But supporters need 60 votes to pass the initiative, thus require the tender of a handful of republicans, at times that in favour of the project conducted intense lobbying to secure the approval of the law.
The democrats, most of the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said it will vote against, and only one republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
For this reason, supporters of the Dream Act need to add several republicans in case other democrats decide to give back the initiative.
Among the more courted republicans are senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the office of senator Mel Martinez.
Other republicans who supported by the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they will not support it on another occasion.
Another republican who supported John McCain, has not defined his position at the moment.
Although the House Of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces major obstacles in the Senate.
With Literature they put the nail on the head
The second round of the pleasures of the language was a walk where participants showed the narration
"That sex in the language I understand it, but... the nail on the head? what is expected of me? ," reported the writer Luisa invited Valenzuela to open the second round of the pleasures of language, cycle that celebrates to Literature in Spanish and this occasion used the subtitle of your question (another on the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, explained).
The nail on the head... "it puts us in jams," fired sweetly the Argentine writer to the public, especially young people, who became appointment in the Equitable International Paper de Guadalajara (FIL) to hear this moderate round table by Marisol Schulz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text for Gonzalo Celorio Schulz and define later as a great story, with Luisa first person as the player who, in search of the "head," it is doctor to doctor, from whom he does not get answers yes although clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectólogo part convinced. perhaps "patience is not my strong, my head."
In the end, after a thwarted approach with the traumatologist that has robbed him encouragement in the corridor, but that makes him to injure it is not a scientific term. it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery. "the head is the real thing open, the symbolic thing is the scar."
The actor sighed relieved and concluded "of the head I only managed to know the real thing and that does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be very mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Sergio Ramirez nicaragua also exposed a delightful entitled narration that Praise of invention, where the nail on the head does not name but in a time it is discovered.
On brush-strokes of magical realism, it is a famous witch, who reached the same roof, brought back to men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maid were lost, narration that turned to talk America soon, the great novel that from the outset did not need their own chroniclers that have touched it and Bernal Díaz Del Castillo who criticised excesses of the rare thing by conquering masters.
"Cervantes that made us all (the writers) made mockery of the false witnesses who appeared on stories presented as real, but otherwise he would have been counting the history of America with imagination that it needed to modesty."
However, it stressed "are mad people and the fakers the best imagine" and that is where it converges truth and lies, where no longer knows that recounted thing it belongs to one side or another, where the fiction Literature reaches its peak.
The flame in fact the "tradition cervantina'.
"His legacy is what it is."
In it, the writer Mayra Montero and applauded the range of interpretations that the nail on the head led the invitation of the FIL with its round table.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican listed his towards the big head of social violence in their country - and shares Latin America product of the disputes of trafficking and drug sales.
"I think good Literature, good poetry, songs have a tacit agreement that of course is not premeditated," he said, after mentioning that the reality of Literature is communication and the size of the commitment to setup between author and readers, and a "chemical reaction."
The night Luis Garcia Montero closed the Spanish poet whose speech also highlighted "the nail on the head of the writer committed by the writer."
It found that in a world that lives to rush the intellectual habits and control of consciences which results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every claim there is a small one, and behind each denial is a small one, yes."
"For being masters of our thinking and owner of reality we must clarify. and to clarify often means to put the nail on the head and offend those who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, black and white, established ideas and without nuance and bothering to the powers that prefer a world in black and white," inviting restore the sense to write.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but it has managed to achieve three times the number.
The mourning of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, besides two different styles marked by its technicians, who find each other with resistance marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but it has managed to achieve three times the number, but until now it has gone blank and that is why this is very special for him.
The Argentinean has ended up being consoled with the medal of the runner-up, he has stayed one step back of the winners and oddly with the same team he has played final in a row.
The Santista strategist at his first stop as coach in the Tournament Opening 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia in which he fell by global of Toluca 4-2 before. later, in Closing 2003 it reached the decisive mourning and also lost it 3-1 overall, just before and Was Confined.
With Saints gap in the Tournament Bicentennial 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén returned to suffer a setback, as his team finished tied 2-2 before the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout it was put in by 3-1 advantage with two chances to seal the title for three players after his failed 11 steps and somersault suffered 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two end with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, its rival, in turn, therefore does not want to suffer the same fate, seeks to emerge from the curse and power to hold a title for the first time, although he says that for most important it is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is a club, a fondness that I am due and in consequence the title for my will come, but this is the most important," said the helmsman when he was questioned about the figures he has opposed playing final.
Very effective it has the end of which, it claims, has learnt a lot, "only education that we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not have, we are ready for ray, the players too, because last time, with two actions to throw we were ready to leave running and I think that is an education, until the party is not over, we can hold."
Knowing that this number could be defined in criminal shots, which do not worry him, because he trusts his players. "Never seeks to reach the actions, it seeks to end in regular time but sometimes it does not have one and you need to be prepared, in the previous match we were prepared, unfortunately did a bad play our destination, sometimes by the nerves or the desire to have the title in the hands, but was told that left us for something that hopefully will not come to that end."
Roman must in their hands no longer a technical runner-up and test for the first time the glory that titles.

When quoting the press, NASA said that it will present "a finding that will impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which raised speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could show the theory that there are creatures with our own and in hostile environments that thought uninhabitable, and would bring to the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings as humans if they improve conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Lake Monkey in Yosemite National Park, California, where he lives in an atmosphere that thought too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiólogos, if these bodies use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will present the findings come in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
At the conference the geobióloga Pamela Conrad will participate, to look into the possibility of life on Mars. and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest Saturn moon), under the prospect of their chemistry is similar to that of Earth.

There are other sites, also neglected and incomplete, said the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Nowadays, so the tour comes does not depend solely on the promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has cleaned in its beaches, in its avenues constant maintenance, which is attractive tourist ones," he said.

IP requests for Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that members assume the responsibility of being an example to look for a better Sinaloa by the various challenges facing.
A Lifetime of dignified and free work on agreements between parties and state Executive requires the business of Mazatlán, because there is a turbulent Sinaloa facing big problems.

Among the list of expectations of the new members of Congress is that they come to make a clean management and engagement with society and with different sectors that they require a responsible job and legislative the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism do not repeat themselves.

Fourteen suspected drug traffickers detained
On Wednesday, Flutes, a ten of persecution in the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis has been made.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, especially in places where production of the drug.
"They have been seized about 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production" Louis-Philippe said Ruel, spokesman for the Security of Quebec.
Overall, eleven men and three women were arrested, including both alleged leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The prisoners had to appear in the palace of justice of Sherbrooke in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of production of Cannabis, possession with the intent of dealing, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These proceedings have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted almost a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that enabled us to make arrests," he needs Mr Ruel.
In the police operation involved about seventy officers of the research module of Flutes of the safety of Quebec, the police Service of Sherbrooke and the Department of Memphrémagog police.
It will be fought against illegal migration smoothly
The bill for the conservatives, which according to the Government, should solve the problem of migrant boats full of clandestine, will surely face much opposition, as the three opposition parties have announced Wednesday that might not support it.
"I am based mainly on the Letter."
"I am here with a party that created the granite that you are above," Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by members declared the liberal leader after the conclusion of the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals advocate that bill in its current form, which would allow for up to one year every person who comes from a vessel identified as transport illegal immigrants, infringes the Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because ends at the wrong target.
"We are against, and apparently all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government does" Mr Duceppe said.
The criticism of the NPD on immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected at a stroke the criticism that his party is not strong enough to illegal immigrants.
"The neodemocrats agree that they are taken action against those in charge of the rafts of illegal and that is what we try with another bill, the C-35," says mr Chow.
"We do not support the bill for the conservatives because he attacks the refugees and prisons to children for a minimum of one year," mr Chow explains.
The Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused the parties in the position to play politicians and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tells members who do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and those who intend to the country as a mat."
"They hope that Canada takes strong measures," Minister Kenney said.
The Government has not announced a confidence vote on his bill, which could lead to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative, told QMI Agency that the Government was going to ask for a vote so that each member who is going to be against explains himself later before his constituents.
The new unit does not get unanimity
Although the possible creation of a permanent body fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest announced, many observers are calling for the establishment of a committee on public consultation on the issue.
The Minister of public Security, Robert Dutil, supports this idea has not been given for two days. Quebec should have consulted with the Department of Research in New York is a question of January last year.
The metropolis have a permanent unity against corruption of 1870.
So the announcement on Tuesday was caught by surprise over.
It is possible to say that, during a meeting of the Council on police services of Quebec last 29 of October, never this measure despite the presence of Robert Dutil discussed.
That was enough for the criticism of the Quebecker party that addresses the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, would describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of the hat" and as "a sloppy solution for last time."
Dutil Minister, on the other hand, he has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over any future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he says simply.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president, Réjean CSQ Parent, nothing can replace the launch of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest is reluctant to prevent the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people will share our view, namely, that has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an inquiry commission is with the resignation of Jean Charest," he explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the national School of public administration.
In order to leave this impasse, it proposes to Quebec that gives a special mandate to the inspector general to conduct a survey of collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the inspector general," he concluded.
It also believes that Quebec could give the controller the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent quadrilles is not the only fledgling project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also calls for Ottawa, which amends the penal Code so that it is best suited to this type of crime.
This seems to come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, which has informed the Minister of Jean-Marc Fournier Justice that the law is not explicit in this type of research.
The federal Minister of public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed on the other hand his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently tipped to make certain amendments on this issue.
During the operation Primavera 2001 related to the moteros groups, although the penal Code would not have adapted, was arrested 131 people.
Later, Ottawa pushed the adoption of the Law on gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme vigilance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored because of the heavy rainfall that have been registered in several regions of the province on Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoons a collapse in Shawinigan took place in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two homes have been evacuated.
At night, another collapse in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière took place.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday until Wednesday at night, various regions registered strong rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
They are also expected at night between 20 and 40 mm extra from now until Thursday, according to the region.
The fields located north of the river and in the valley of the Outaouais were affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these rainfall are added to the melting of the snow that had piled in some areas, it is feared that many are overflowing rivers.
Wednesday at night, the unity of Quebec Safety alert issued for rivers and Achigan Ouareau in Lanaudière.
Rivers in northern Saint-Jérôme, the Laurentides, and Chêne, Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavy rainfall has caused flooded some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-of-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rain have dragged an emergency bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten homes have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, certain height of lakes has caused the closure of several routes, particularly in the Mansfield-ET-Pontefract municipality.
The unity of civil Security is still on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Bouchard, Annik security adviser.
The anticipation of the floods of Quebec, on the other hand, ads aired Wednesday, indicating strong floods of several rivers, particularly Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and Loup.
They accuse partially Dupont
The radio presenter of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Council of the rules of the broadcaster (CCNR) for some controversial statements on social care and the Haitians and their harsh language on the radio.
The CCNR believes that Mr Dupont and his team of 98.1 FM CHOI had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduly negative representation of the Haitians and crude language that should not be used in emissions spread throughout the day."
The Council has also pointed out that discussions about suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about the comments made in emissions magnitude between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the common Front of people receiving social care in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the release was wrong.
The presenters must communicate reliable data rather than leading to deception.
In connection with the suicide, the Stéphane Dupont had said that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most of the members of the Committee reached the conclusion that the message was that suicide as a solution to the problems of life should not be considered.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes impugn Dupont "midi" you have treated in a sensitive issue a fair and appropriate way."
So in this respect any guilt has been rejected.
The latest dispute was about statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had done a media confrontation which had raised numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter said that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because i could not know if the needy were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but their cumulative effect illegally is a negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already done my suspension of three days up there."
"My record is clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of crude language.
In any case, the radio station has been CHOI-FM "even more of the required."
The impact will be minimal for the station, which will, among other things, to announce decisions once in the hours of greater audience in three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
Montrealés of Algerian origin Zemmal Nacereddine has had a very strange way.
The athlete, who stresses in "sanda" kung fu "full contact"), and thai kickboxing, provides box tatamis and rings in the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practising martial arts as the kung fu and kickboxing for 12 years, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who lives in the metropolis of 2008 to move in the professional level.
"In my case, I everywhere are looking for fighting because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground that they involve mixed martial arts, few powers in North America exist."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and employee at the UPS company, recently delivered the bad news for its rivals, winning two gold medals in the Championship of the World amateur in the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 of October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the category of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"At the moment I prepare myself to take part in the World cup of san shou in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the first four positions in the last championship of the world in each category."
"At 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto.
"At 2005 in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"At 2007 in China, I finished the match in fifth position, but I reached the third position in Toronto 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I have been making progress in every competition."
"This step. I will be the first time next year or"

450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Quebec was granted direct contracts for 450 million dollars to firms of engineering for hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a partnership formed by companies VPR, Dessau, Groupe SM Axor, and that the most important contract has achieved without a previous auction, project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called gérance Énergie, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision of Hydro-Quebec to rely on the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5,000 million dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the partnership gérance Énergie the lucrative contract with earlier one tender.
For Quebecker Party, using pools of companies raise serious ethical problem that threatens eliminating competition and lead to higher prices.
"It is a new method of collusion and to eliminate competition."
"That is to say, people rather than doing it in secret, now do it," said yesterday the member of the Quebecker Simard Sylvain Party at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the national Assembly because, as he says, he does not understand how it is possible to benefit in this way the public interest.
The Minister of natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denies that there has been a collusion with this contract.
"I began to tire," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "dishonest" way and "lack of rigour."
He said that the "minimum" would be that the PQ apologised.
The formula for partnerships is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit for two or more companies to bring their knowledge to respond to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high degree of complexity, given the scale of work.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract was awarded without competition into the game. it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the formula for partnerships is no longer the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Devoir published last week, the formula for partnerships in technical advice is undergoing an investigation into the Government.
A quick look at the commercial register of Quebec may identify more than 200 companies, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, the Dessau company works in partnership with the majority of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche ET Tecsult, and others.
Each mix, and there are dozens of them, leads a single legal entity, Dessau.
On the Énergie partnership gérance, Normandeau Minister stressed that "the James Bay meets a particularly dynamic workforce and Hydro-Quebec respond specifically to her from years 1970."
The head of the project, Real Eastmain Laporte, Société d'énergie of Baie James (SEBJ), has provided an explanation that highlighted the fact that the contract to manage the project has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to tender and are few players, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to a consortium gérance Énergie part of a long contract list of more than 50,000 dollars obtained by the Quebecker Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking Devoir, has identified 109 contracts for technical advice issued between 2002 and 2010 companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin got 22 Génivar contracts, got 16, 14 Tecsult Dessau and 10, regardless of their involvement in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
Overall, they amount to 449.783.344 dollars, including Énergie contract 295.131.564 gérance of dollars.
Sylvain Simard implied that the four companies that form the consortium (VPR, Dessau, Groupe SM) and Axor "sound of the liberal Party of Quebec."
Normandeau minister has left to fall to the PQ is also linked to these companies, "fund," before specifying that is rather its leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply sceptical.
The Quebecker consumer as soon as he is confident the players of sustainable development, as well as in trademarks of fair trade and certified organic to guide its elections.
According to the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a media universe where messages teem advocating a more responsible consumption, but lament the lack of reliable information and consider this hampers even its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in the 2010 Quebecker ones seem to have very little credit for those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of businesses or advertizing green, it reveals measurement tool developed by the Centre for consumption responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion. half of consumers calls into question the reliability of official certificates that carry the products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carries labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsables," says Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the Quebecker ones are taken seriously the speeches from policies on this issue.
In any case, information about the responsible consumption is essential to encourage this sector of consumption, underpinned by nearly a third of the Quebecker consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious nature of the information cause that 46% of consumers reject that option.
It is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the high price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecker group also says distrust of the alleged returns on green products and services that are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and they changed the mark of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% Have prioritised the purchases in the shops in his district and preferred to buy worked food products in their region, says Barometer.
Greener and responsible (the rate of responsible consumption reached 64 points for a maximum of one hundred this year), Homo consumus adores Quebec to hold the position of the king of recycling that aims to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about protecting wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, which social conscience outside seems door (of the car). at 2010, just 28% of those Quebecker indicated that he used public transport or shared car to defend his green principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive survey of behaviour, just completing its first edition, walking support the use of bicycles and travel.
A loan for the State regains eXcentris
Quebec government to have asked eXcentris financially committed in the recovery of the complex of pos cinemas the Société Angus and Parallèle, agreed to cooperate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and Parallèle, expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back to Daniel Langlois cinema complex in the eXcentris boulevard Saint-Laurent and to restore their real cinephile vocation, he has not got what they asked.
The Government has agreed to involve himself in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government proposes a loan, whose size would actually be less than initial expectations. this could be a viable solution in favourable conditions, according to at least some employees public.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a petition from 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The chairman of Société de développement DES entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, leading the eXcentris, sent a proposal and a plan of action to St-Pierre Minister.
He sent a final report makes a ten days.
However, the SODEC received a counter-proposal of ministers on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus in need until 31, to answer the same.
In any case, it seems that the idea of a donation of State should be rejected.
Remember that the owner Association of cinemas and the movie complexes of Quebec opposed a direct reversal of the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Culture Ministry does not have to finance real estate projects, as it has done with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several industry representatives did require a substantial financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, has taken over ten years the burden of film copyrights in their offices of the complex, after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the treasury.
The lack of rooms for independent films is clear in Montreal and eXcentris had known fidelizar to their clientele.

The veil of Canada with a complex was...
The new us diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States regards as the complex of Canadians with the Americans, yet reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters do not think about the Canada-State relations when they go to vote, they believe that the visit of president Obama has helped the conservative government to get its budget for 2009 was approved.
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and washington made public yesterday, rather offer substantial details contained really substantial.
A cable of 22 of September of 2008, for a total federal election campaign, relates to what extent the United States does not enter the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to us ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are influenced by a practically inherent inferiority complex Canadians in addressing everyday household items, instead of leaving such election to the United States (like during the campaign about 1988 free trade) ," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant in this election. ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has problems in understanding this "deafening silence" even as both countries hold some intense political and economic relations.
"Naturally, i thought, the ability of one candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationship should be a key factor in which the voters to vote should think."
This sense of importance can be seen also sent cables 22 of January of 2009 by Terry Is Annoyed, in charge d'affaires in Ottawa, prepare to president Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His visit will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the start of February on the federal budget, in which Canada will record for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan between 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars," writes the Late.
No side mention that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to prevent it replaced the coalition and opposition parties for their survival on the quality of the recovery plan.
Another communication of January of 2008 signed by ambassador Wilkins warning to washington on the increasingly negative image that convey the scale dramatic series in the CBC the United States.
The ambassador emission concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings are done little so that the company make forceful interrogations.
Another cable realise that, during their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be prepared to accept some prisoners at Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but who depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has sent a document to the Secretary Of State for Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can say that the mood on the WikiLeaks site have warmed.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser near Stephen Harper, said on the CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive flight should "be killed."
In the United States echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday the UN has proposed in Cancún a renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in an amount that is almost a third of the additional reduction to be carried out to stabilise the climate of the earth to 2020.
This ambitious plan is framed in all major projects concrete that the UN hopes that it will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments reduction in industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still grab between 50 and 70% of the market, would be replaced by light bulbs fluocompactas or, even more good for light bulbs of light-emittent diodes (or "LED" in English), much of 1,800 million tonnes (Gt) of GEI issued on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent to 70% of emissions from global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, the big emitting countries, including the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, with some voluntary reduction plans to reduce global emissions of 53 GEI of 49 Gt to Gt.
However, 5 should be minimised even Gt of this amount to stabilise, to 2020, rising temperatures to two degrees Celsius to avoid that it is out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of energy deal in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
In the case of light bulbs fluocompactas, the cost of energy is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs LED, twice still further reduced energy consumption.
The bulbs fluocompactas last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new bulbs LED, like the manufacturer Philips has sent this week (a company that has participated in the study of the UN), have a lifespan of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than incandescent light bulb, which allows us to do a picture of the savings can be achieved with the replacement plan would be implemented in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very low heat.
Superficially, they do not contain anything of mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about the bulbs fluocompactas because they contain mercury and remove themselves as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions in the world are not light bulbs fluocompactas, but the coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with the incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the benefits that international programme would offer every country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 - equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Ivory Coast anxiously awaits the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary - General, Ban Ki-moon, has called for the "immediate" disclosure of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast, as the deadlines have expired.
"The secretary-general stressed the need for the independent electoral commission completes its work and announce provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the head of the UN.
"Calls on all parties in the Ivory Coast and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative to announce provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline of midnight on Wednesday without the results were published three days from the scrutiny of Sunday.
Over forty minutes before the end of the term, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission "continuing" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the applications have increased in the world that the CIS finally claims the name of the winner of the second round between the Laurent Gbagbo projection and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the side of Gbagbo has the cancellation by the constitutional Council of "fraudulent" vote in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the new Forces (FN) from the blow of Failed State of September of 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign for the president of the Ivory Coast, has said that the tactics of intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded supporters of the outgoing president to turn out to vote.
The choice could be cancelled if the constitutional Council accepts the complaints lodged by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of Gbagbo see the highest court in the country is not neutral, as is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of which denies any connection to the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" delays in publishing the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that there is lost and to lodge a complaint before the constitutional Council having prevented the electoral commission spreading the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential ones Sunday, have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation to a country divided into two years ago.
The United Nations has warned Wednesday the political class from the Ivory Coast that could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended in the first round, 31 of October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly supported former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and will answer all the questions that the magistrate asks, not fantasy."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to show them," had told AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, before the advent of her client.
Mr Guérini, brother of the leader of the socialist party in the department Guérini Jean-Noël, wanted to convey through his lawyers, the judge before his hearing, a document to explain himself.
Wednesday at night began to investigate and imprisoned also one of his close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, who has done his client has been caring for landfill to manage.
Regarding the allocation of contracts or the fate of funds related to its execution, nothing is known about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
In this case, it is being investigated, from Daniel Pinna Wednesday, former director - general of the urban sprawl of Aubagne, for embezzlement and complicity, but they have left him on probation and prohibited to meet the players in the case.

A source close to the investigation indicates that the investigations focusing on particular conditions and allocation of a landfill in Ciotat, which contains the waste Aubagne, as well as other cities in urban community in Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss issue. the Elysée palace is exaggerated the mediation of Syrian
For more than ten months between July of 2009 and May of 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a French scientist arrested in Iran for "spying," it has had on tenterhooks to the public in France, it has alerted diplomacy and has highlighted the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the watchful eye of diplomats from the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde unknown disclose certain aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée palace has explained his strategy for the Americans to the point to give advice to manage their own crises of "hostages" in Iran -a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and looked for American justice for trafficking of materials for iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the syrian president, Bashar Al-Assad, he had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted 12 for August from 2009 in Paris takes the title "Iran. French comments on how to handle cases involving hostage-taking."
The Elysian advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for Middle East and North Africa, Patrice Paoli, is with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
Explain the French method.
They advise the Americans who make the following to repatriate their own citizens held force in Iran.
"You make noise," they say, ` you continually loosen" in the media the words "basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian regime, watch your image.
"If the Iranians ask you to stop, he still more often."
Because, having exhausted the negotiation attempts by discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are experts on "delaying tactics."
Mr Richier adds that the detention of aliens is "customary Iranian tactics. the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
It announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place 16 of August day that will take refuge in the embassy of France "will require payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 Euros reward).
In addition, it indicates that the Elysée palace provides other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "will increase."
The Iranians could "in the near future to another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," say.
28 August of 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but it is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated. the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition calls for the United States by illicit trafficking of delicate electronic equipment to Iran, has been released in Paris on the decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as many observers, this strange coincidence.
For Washington, this close the Iranian underground networks of procuring material for nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is the bad news.
France has accepted an exchange?
Releasing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, 4 of September, François Richier ensures that this was not the case.
The Elysée palace, says, "it was extremely surprised by the decision of the judge," but it tried to oppose it.
"There have been intensive negotiations between the French president and Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can not overturn the court decision" comment.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under tight surveillance" of the French intelligence services.
The councillor of the Elysée palace dials a telephone number, hangs and then he informs us diplomat for the Iranian "is currently in some buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée palace spare no efforts, uses announcements and "organised flights" in the media to suggest that syrian president Bashar Al-Assad has an important" and "influential" part "of "mediator."
Americans see this activity with some irony and see the manipulation of fruit, as several newspaper articles convey the French official version.
A telegram on 25 2009, "mentions" media blitz by French officials."
How such "thanks" is due to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians really have done."
The document covers the reasons the Elysée palace to produce this fiction.
The hard work of communication "is intended to validate the policy of Sarkozy of openness towards Syria," he believes.
A policy initiated by 2008, "according to numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been wiped off early and been lower."
When "exaggerating the syrian role," Paris intends "to show Syria praise that can harvest if you play a constructive role in the region."
The aim is to "sowing the seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy is good source.
11 August - François Richier trusts: "of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But we have appreciated that."
"At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss go back to France 16 from may's 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive it in the Elysée palace.
In a statement, thanks to the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio that have played "an active role for the release of a compatriot."
As of midnight, the Korean girls can not play in keeping
The South Korean Government is set to adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent the teenagers for participating in games after midnight blocking their access, according to have made accountable government.
On thursday a bill will be submitted to Parliament to demand online gambling companies that less than block access to these games after midnight to 16 years, according to have expressed representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and, later, it is hard to study at college and to lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to dream," said AFP Jo Rhine, the person in charge of the bill.
Online gambling will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare the application of the law requires.
The government also plans to ask firms to limit the access time these games when the parents of the young request it, added responsible.
In addition, it is going to put at the disposal of calling for this free software that enables the Internet link time.
South Korea is one of the countries "connected" and newspapers reporting regularly on various tie deeds to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world powers games online.
November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where he faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World. FIFA appoint the organising countries
In the middle of a storm sparked by corruption suspicions, the executive committee of FIFA designates Thursday to the organising the Glasses of 2018 and 2022, a clear political choice where the struggles of lobbying clout and can prevail on technical grounds.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of competition FIFA will be held in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates. England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Low-Belgium Countries).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia), after an opening on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue their introduction in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who was part of the delegations (David Cameron, prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Sócrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of Government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the political and economic interests at stake in a world cup.
The backroom deals are therefore possible that last until the last minute.
For others, it is difficult to establish hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the assessment report of FIFA, nominations English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) own better case than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight to the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, head of the revelations that led to the suspension of corruption of two members of the european (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have derailed the chances of his country, home of football, which hosted the world cup once, at 1966.
The bbc added fuel to the fire on Monday when sharing a documentary that exposed to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicholas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and shame on the English, who have sent their lobbying hard in recent weeks with David Cameron at the top.
The Head of Government hopes to hit reedit successfully delivered by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had 2005 for London organising JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity will it be enough to restore the gloss of England before the EC?
It is not clear, as the Spain-Portugal couple also has many strengths through its phases, already preparing their experience (world of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992 european cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic outlook and financial both countries could pull down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against English and doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal all they do is to give items to Russia, turned into an outsider in weight, despite the gaps in his candidature (stadiums, hotels, travel).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin agreed not to travel to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"They are picking up their dirty linen, trying to compromise," said to them ."
For 2022, the United States, which has 1994 experience, seems the most logical favorites.
First major global economic power and location of the sponsors of FIFA, it seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have evolved separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidates seem premature two countries that have organised together the championship in 2002.
Another risk. the award from the world's 2026 to China, fervent wish by FIFA, that would mean that Asia remained without possibilities for 2022.
Next to Qatar, that their project has made based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, Japan and Korea could also suffer from the weakness of the pay TV rights (based on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term. the evidence
De Gaulle really had hesitated.
Mitterrand had intimated that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
Sarkozy and even less.
A mandate in the Elysée palace is another.
The current head of State will be back with 2012.
However, the evidence of it does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, it is always necessary to pretend that question.
To one side or the other.
At 2006, although they would not believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac said that it did not rule out a third term.
15 November - seriously, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would eventually make his decision "in the autumn of 2011.
So the fact that it deals with the UMP, Tuesday nights at the Elysée palace, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a stir.
It is the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
Only the president indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited to two the number of mandates to five years.
It simply given the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that speaks of the presidential ones, with a humorous tone in meeting of this kind.
"At worst, or best, cases, you will still spend seven and a half with me," he had 2009 loosen July.
On another occasion, May of 2010. "Do not think I do not see what will come later."
Their assertions of the day before yesterday do not address more nomination, nor less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has raised the scene which leads to Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerar itself.
Quite the contrary. the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is clear is what leads to many people in the PS to protest that the battle is organised earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and the UMP there is no discussion on the subject, immediately reacted cautiously and environment Prime Minister.
"If it thinks it can lose, it will not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always believe that he can win," Alain Juppé correct, resigned before the evidence.
Euro. the ecb is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of Letters from the State's
The last meeting of the Board of governors of the European Central Bank (ecb) of the year would be allowed to require the way out of the crisis, or at least to announce the adjournment of a large number of unconventional operations of monetary policy should conclude at the end of the year.
Because of the crisis in European sovereign debt, the institute of issuing of Frankfurt will certainly not be able to afford to be so, if you do not want to risk a situation worse than complicated in the European bond markets.
The political cost could be as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has backed the active role played by the ecb in favour of the solution to the debt crisis of European States.
He did not say whether it believed that the central bank should do more to increase its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues..."
The eve in Brussels, during his hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee of the European Parliament, the chairman of the ecb, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not only more eloquent about his intentions, saying that the purchase of Letters from the State in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we agreed" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ecb will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the level in history from may's 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of obligations of Treasure from the ecb has doubled last week to nearly 1,350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, i would have bought again Irish and Portuguese titles yesterday.
Overall, the central banks of eurosystem have bought securities for an amount of eur 67,000 million from may's 2010.
Among the operators of the market, it is not the slightest than they will continue the purchases (look at page 29).
Economists do not anticipate any significant change of course.
Although the operations of loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ecb, it still provides unlimited liquidity provision to good conditions and with durations varying between one week and three months.
Economists hope that this measure extends for some months.
"I do not imagine that it is going to change dramatically its programme."
"If not, the risk of causing new short-term tension," believes Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011, down," by her side, Norbert Bräms Salt economist.
Oppenheim.
In relation to the interventions in the market of the national debt, "the ecb should maintain a volume of purchases of these obligations to the market remains stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of exposure of European banks to the markets of sovereign debt in the eurozone, the institute has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It should compensate at any cost the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in yields paid by the most fragile States," an important bond manager said yesterday.
Because, if interest rates brought by clouds, States will have problems even more to reduce their debt, or even to stabilise it.
This is the price to protect the Euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government's weather heaves
After Italy has started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb tide of types of bonds to 10 years.
A revival of the precarious calm.
Coming out of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional presidents have said they heard Giulio Tremonti to describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an unpredictable" weekend was expected "statements later denied by interested.
In any case, Tuesday the difference in the rates in the long-term German had reached the record of 210 basis points and hedge contracts in bankruptcy risk (CRQ) had soared to 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
In the Cabinet, Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain, the difference in German rates were above 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta said, were "deeply concerned" about "the turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, such as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," he explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of revenue associated with it, which makes the State runs the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cool water jug for the government.
It is estimated that the Italian respectively growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% at 2012, while the budget being considered in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit next year will represent 4.3% of GDP (against 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour that new budget provisions can be implemented after the celebrations by an amount of eur 7,000 million.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be taken," the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of the economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been for a long time," said Arrigo, secure Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either short or long - term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011 EDITORIAL NOTE), called for efforts of stabilisation Italy are lower than the required to other countries," comment on Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
It is the problem of political instability.
14 December - Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the House Of Representatives, after which the elections at the end of the March could be expected.
In that case, a propitious time to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would be opened.
The European consider strengthening the mechanisms of combating the crisis
Christine Lagarde has said so yesterday during a press conference in Paris. "I think we have shown Sunday at night and day, that europeans are clearly supportive, and committed to defending its currency and its currency zone."
Although he was a relative, relaxation reported yesterday in the types of bonds of European States has prompted governments and the ecb.
However, we still can not talk about standardisation principle.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that could lower the ratings of debt of Portugal, the most frequent target at present of speculation.
"As this May lack in political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," believe the economists from Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the policy rate is much slower than the rate of markets."
Aware of this gap and the dangers that hide, European countries intensify the debate to strengthen mechanisms to exit from existing crisis.
The informal consultations between the finance Ministers who are most directly affected and, generally, with their counterparts from the G20 are on track.
And this also taking meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin earlier this week.
The ecb meets today.
On the agenda, the kind of unconventional measures to support the countries of the eurozone in the collimator of markets (consultation) above.
As far as the European Stability fund (FEEF Financiera, its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a path for Asia to inform investors from the Far East on the new features of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, this prepares the ground.
It is anticipated that the first broadcasts of the titles are done FEEF next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative is confident Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
As far as the countries that are in the front line, Portugal and Spain, these preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly on the labour market.
These reforms are added to the austerity measures with immediate effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move in a different way from what followed Greece and Ireland.
Both want at all costs to avoid asking for international aid before applying their own budget corrections and decide the structural reforms that they consider necessary to increase the confidence of lasting way.
The capitalist partners of European funds, finally, consider the options available to speed up the process of normalization of the public markets.
Of passage for Paris, 24 of November, Axel Weber were the first to launch the idea that if the 750,000 million mobilized for Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to returning to the portfolio.
Economists from Barclays Capital, an actor from the front line in the market of European government debt, to the tune of around 100,000 million additional Euros would be enough, "preferably in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The instrument for it. the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently equipped with 60,000 billion.
A council which, without a doubt, could examine the capitals in detail.
Especially if they worsen market conditions.
Snow and ice. 24 departments on orange alert
The snowed ones are causing movement difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect different economic activity.
At the moment, twenty-four departments are orange alert due to the risk and icing-up snowed.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have added the two departments were already orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two Dordogne and Gironde, joined at night to the group.
According to Météo France, the snow-covered heavy falls affect northern Gironde and Charentes, although snow also slightly in Island of France.
Some are expected snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, precise between 7 and 10 cm in the departments affected, and between 1 and 3 cm or even up to 5 cm, in the paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Normandy, Island of France and Lemosín.
The snowed are strong enough to cause travel problems and affect economic activity, alerts Météo France.
The Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to the heavy vehicles with more has been banned than 7.5 tonnes, including axes and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac Guingamp-Lannion.
According to the marshals, the movement in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it is not made safe in case of need and the movement of certain vehicles TER has been banned for the day.
During Thursday, school transport in Picardy has been banned.
Wednesday had not planned any specific measures at night to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all motorists to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adjust their driving to the situation."
The Directorate General of civil aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines Thursday cancelled 25% of their flights at paris Roissy airport, Orly 10% because of the snowed.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, the Gatwick airport, south of London, and one of Edinburgh, in Scotland, is closed until Thursday.
Metre of the Grand Paris. the first drafts
Since the debate on modernisation of transportation on the Island of France has reached its climax, billions of rain.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about 23,000 million for the metro of the Grand Paris to build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to launch this SGP, the State announced an allocation of funds of 4,000 billion.
In theory, this amount will be the one that will allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to fund a portion of its double loop.
Now, finally, we have the first accounts.
The letter of law of 2010 finance, examined in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax of equipment and increasing the tax on offices on the Island of France.
First, we read article 15 of the bill, is "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
In addition, it is imperative to figures. "The product of this tax is 117 billion a year."
Second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists to "modernise it, to increase their product and putting this increase in the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would be achieved with this method?
Who knows.
In the figures do not exist.
But it is far from 4,000 million.
"It requires that the fiscal resources add 4,000 billion allocation of funds that will mobilise the State and will give the Société du Grand Paris as you go," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP it is no surprise that system.
"From the moment where incomes are created (both imposed, editorial note), we can cover studies for three years and then receive 4,000 million later, as we explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and will be based on the needs."
The SGP is estimated that it will empecerá to receive 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, which hired 4,000 million do not appear in the credit, can cause a parliamentary debate slightly heated.
The first public session will be 7 of December.
Avenging diligently hackers and spy
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an apparent scandal keeps revealing a scandal that just seems scandal before the hypocrisy that governs the relationship between the people and the press.
On the other hand, it announced deep international level changes and anticipates a future dominated by the setback.
But we go step - by - step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that each file created by a secret service (independent nation to belongs) is comprised entirely of cuts press.
"Extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual mores of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written for months in every newspaper (except for those who belong to Berlusconi) and sinister mocking Khadafi profile has long by ideas to artists in cabaret to create their sketches.
The rule under which the secret files should only be formed by the news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret service, and not just in this century.
If he visits a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each job just repeats (Grail, the mystery of Rennes-him-Château, the Templarios or Rosacruz) what had been written in previous works.
This is not only because occultist text authors do not want to make unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news on the nonexistent thing), but because engaged to occultism not just hope that you know which reconfirms what they had learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret files.
The informer is lazy, as it is lazy (or it has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, what I know, editor of Libération, who only feels certain that can recognise.
The top secret information on Berlusconi who sent the American embassy in Rome to the Department of state is the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
Then why they have caused such a stir the revelations of these issues?
On the one hand, they only know what all worked person or knows that the embassies, since at least World War II and since the Heads Of State can be called by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, we lost its diplomatic role and, with the exception of some exercises limited representation, they have been transformed into espionage facilities.
Any spectator who sees research films knows perfectly well, we just pretend that we do not know for hypocrisy.
In any case, repeat publicly breaks it was hypocritical and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker anyone can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world to significantly affect the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal affects both the victims and the perpetrators."
But we enter the true nature of what has happened.
Once, when Orwell, it could be designed to power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has become a reality as being able to control every movement through the phone, each made transaction, visited hotel motorway made public in this way was a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it shows, as happens now that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape the scrutiny of a hacker monitoring relationship no longer one-way street and becomes to move.
Energy monitors every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the avenger of the people) can know all the secrets power.
How can fill a power that can no longer or retain its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said that a real secret is a secret empty (and a secret gap could never be unveiled). it is also true that all knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or She is actually a secret gap, without secret because it comes from the public. but to uncover, as did WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were secret gaps means to clear any power.
WikiLeaks has not made any harm to Sarkozy and Merkel; and, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused such a powerful power?
It is clear that in future the States will no longer be able to put on the web no reserve reports, as would be publishing a poster in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that, with the current technologies, it can not be expected to keep confidential talks by telephone.
Nothing is easier to discover if and when a Head Of State was posted by plane and has contacted one of the peers.
How they will be able to keep future in private and confidential relations?
I know that my forecasting science fiction and is therefore entirely fictional, but I imagine the players who move in a discreet way in proceedings with uncontrollable itineraries, taking messages that have been learned from memory or, at least, hiding data written on the heels of his shoes.
That information is stored in a single copy, drawers closed with key. after all, the attempted espionage of the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that the technology at the moment is like a crab, namely back.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionised communications, the Internet has returned to create a telegraph with cables (phone).
The video tapes (analogue) had allowed the researchers to study film, a film step - by - step forward and slipping backwards, discover the secrets of the house, while the CDS (digital) only allows forward or back of chapter in chapter, namely huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in flight, with travel involved, we need three hour and a half.
It is nothing out of the ordinary that the policy and communication techniques to take more carriages.
One last comment.
Formerly, the press tried to understand what was secretly plotted in embassies.
At present, those are the embassies calling for confidential information to the press.
Climate. the shoddy work of France in its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen accord, it is time to examine whether quickly unlocked promises of funding have been observed (called quick start and early) made by developed countries.
And the French shoddy work has unveiled.
The Copenhagen accord, developed countries pledged to provide 30,000 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute 7,200 billion Euros over three years and France 1,260 billion (i.e 420 million a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that his commitment to the fast start funding is real. a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a large additional event, the leaflet distribution...
The operation transparency and measurable result was appreciated for what it is worth. developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries did the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announced that it has released 2010 2,200 billion, which puts it in the right way towards fulfilling its commitment from 7,200 million during 2012.
But if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen accord, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming the official development assistance.
Unfortunately, this has not reached an agreement on what means "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that suits you.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference year 2009. international financing remains and they add 150 million in three years for financing fast start.
Other countries have made similar statements regarding the year or at the level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France sees the financing of all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, referring to the costs of previous years and the total level of official development assistance is not done.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries can remain stable or even fall), as it seeks to respect its commitment on "new and additional" money...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, any legislation does not exist and everybody chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each paid Euro is equivalent to a donated Euro.
Obviously, this is hard to justify. the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that is based on more effective technologies), is misleading to present one that is going to recover as equivalent to one that is donated... At most, the cost of borrowing for the country would only be compute for its commitments to grant loans (i.e the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France does not find useful such reasoning. "respect" its commitment of eur 420 million, with 91.5% loans (389.8 billion) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million Euros). consultation document on the EU to see it with his own eyes.
It is the only eu country that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in a 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when most of the European Union makes a Euro to meet its commitment, France brings ten cents and only considers the effort is similar.
A good trick!
In short, in its funding quick start, France does a double abuse. on the one hand, in relation to action in time, and on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 billion, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 "new and additional" million, as promised.
The handling of the Ministry of Finance (because it looks Bercy that has been arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States were to continue donating when they can simply pay) as in the talks, as developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter of the early financing is relatively minucia in the short term, on a whole climate negotiations.
But it could be a bit more in the vast machinery that is CMNUCC.
Let us hope it is not.
Whatever, is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could herald a change in the method of calculation for years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to honour their commitments in the same way that the other countries of the European Union.
But particularly France could lead to advanced discussions on the stakes involved in long-term financing (another key chapter that is currently under discussion). we will not get rid of the "additional character" and the method to compute the loans.
France could change its position to become so progressive in relation to this issue as it with others.
So we have given up hope of the new Environment Minister, mr Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on quick start in France and their vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning of pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 ingests a day 81 different chemicals, as it suggests a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
Association, which it warns that its results "do not have significant statistic given the limited number of samples analysed, but illustrative of the problem are tried," he acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and the food that they eat a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack each day.
These meals taken as a model, that the official recommendations (five bits of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day), as well as the concerns were examined in laboratories in search of chemicals and pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The dish is overwhelming. 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as a carcinogen possible or probable and five substances classified as a carcinogen insurance, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disturbers (PE), according to studies of various institutions such as the international Centre for research on cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases the legal limits for each of the chemicals individual are not exceeded clearly, our study shows that exposure to potentially carcinogenic substances and/or EP is worrying," it notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea contains milk alone more than ten thought possible carcinogen and three as carcinogenic insurance, as well as around twenty of waste that can damage to the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian fillet, the tin tuna and the bar of bread or chewing gum were even decorated with pesticides and other chemicals.
Water from the tap, the analysis found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At the dinner, slice the salmon was more "nutritional" with 34 detected chemical waste and analysis of the used plastic plate to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that generates these "cocktails of pollutants" for the consumer "is underestimated," says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Them Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases in civilisation."
July, a study by the European Food Safety authority (EFSA) indicated the presence of waste from 365 different pesticides identified in the eat fruit and vegetables in Europe, 76 in cereals.
