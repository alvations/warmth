The Market of Prague finished with less points in the end of the day 
After the fast fall in the morning, the Market of Prague corrected its losses. 
The transactions of the actions of reached approximately the half of value that have in a normal day. 
The Market of Prague, at the beginning on Tuesday commercial, reacted immediately to the fall on Monday when descended approximately to a 6%. 
The lowering of this time itself due to the fall of the actions in Wall Street. 
Also here itself espresso the reaction of the market before the result of the voting of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the plan of stabilization of the secretary of the financial sector. 
Fall of the actions in Asia 
The actions of the Asian Markets lived Tuesday a fall dramatics, although along the day the index reduced finally splits of the losses. 
The index of the Market Hang Seng of Hong Kong along its financial day marked almost four percent, although later reduced its losses reducing the descent in practically 2.5 percent. 
The index of Hang Seng Chinese Enterprises that continues the movements of the Chinese actions in the Market of Hong Kong descended 3.8 percent, in Shangai the markets were closed. 
The actions of the Market of Sidney lost more five percent but, in the end, the losses descended to 4.3 percent. 
The Market of Taiwan according to the secretary of the Index descended to 3.6 percent. 
"The actions of rescue planned in United States are insecure and this influences in the financial market of the entire world", indicated the Leader of the Office of the Currency of Hong Kong, Joseph Yam. 
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, she sóla determines its monetary policies, that is to say, without dependence of the Central Bank of China. 
The interest rates of Hong Kong are to the same level as those of the United States. 
The American legislators should be met again as soon as possible, according to the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, and to approve a proposal of support to the financial system. 
Otherwise, threat with which the falls they will cause they will feel in other countries. 
Bloody bath of the American actions 
Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan of aid to the financial system to which 700 thousand million dollars should be dedicated (almost some 12 trillion crowns). 
The legislators, of that form, they ignored the invitation of the president George Bush to support their plan. 
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and would help to stabilize all the economy. 
Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bath and chiefly the index of the actions they collected the greater fall in more than 20 years. 
The index of Dow Jones descended to almost seven percent. A fall of volume seemed was registered for last time in the year 1987. 
The index descended already before being announced but so quick was shown that the proposal of the assembly did not do well, the index began to fall freely. 
The congress withdraws: The government of United States can inject 700 thousand million dollars in the banking 
The highest representatives of the Congress and of the government, the president George W. Bush, they came to an agreement in a pact in extensive terms of financial aid to the system of American finances. 
Its voting will be carried out at the beginning of the next week. 
The American legislators caused a gap in the conversations on the approval of the plan of rescue in their form of aid to the American financial system with the quantity of 700 thousand million dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns). 
Nevertheless, yet is not earned. 
The congresspersons should tune up some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that be voted. 
The plan of aid to the financial system will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives. 
It said Sunday to the agency Reuters, Barney Frank, president of the Committee for financial Products and of the Banking of the Assembly. 
According to some sources, the voting on the plan would be able to carry out in the Senate not before on Wednesday. 
According to the economists, the arrival of the ratification of the plan of rescue should represent the announcement of a first psychological significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market. 
Later, nevertheless, it will arrive at the "desencantamiento" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid to the market will reach also in practice. 
Paulson: The plan should be efficient 
"We have carried out a great advance. 
We solve our dissenting opinions with regard to the form that should have the package of measures for the stabilization of the market" commented the democratic one Nancy Pelosiá to the agency Bloomberg. 
According to her, the final voting would be able still to be carried out Sunday. 
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with the minister of finances, Henry Paulson, to give him a final form to the Fund of the government. 
This it should buy of the financial companies the mortgage assets done not sell that carry to the financial businesses to hard losses and they threaten the stability of all the system. 
"We are on the verge of closing the covenant on the plan, which will function and should also be efficient in the market. 
It is necessary to continue still with the plan of clean-up, but I believe that already we are in it", said Paulson. 
A sign for the Asian business 
The global financial crisis impacts explicitly in the market of actions that descend quickly. 
According to the democratic senator by Snowfall, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing everything possible so that the Congress approve finally an agreement this Sunday. 
They want with it to calm down the business of the investors before the market of Asian finances since these are the ones that are found in the first time zone and where the Congress would be able to influence in the commerce on Monday. 
Nevertheless, for now there it is nothing clearly with security on when will vote the two cameras of the American Congress and, not even, if themselves they will not be stopped in the last moment with some problem. 
The legislators believe that will be approved in the next days. 
The law, nevertheless, will suffer a series of changes. 
The total quantity destined to help the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion they have to be available as soon as possible, just as requested the president George Bush. 
Nevertheless, the Congress can block the liberation of the remaining quantity if had the impression that the program does not comply with its function, what would be a matter of other 100 thousand million dollars and, later, of the last 350 thousand million dollars. 
Bush valued the advance of the meetings 
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but the Congress can surpass its veto by a majority of votes. 
In spite of these changes the basic idea of the program was conserved that consisted of winning financial resources for the buyback of bad mortgage titles whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not capable of finishing of paying its mortgages. 
"We have worked all. 
The Assembly of representatives would have that to be prepared to vote the law Sunday, and the Senate Monday", commented the republican senator, Judd Gregg. 
Also the American president Bush is satisfied with the advance of the encounters. 
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance on Saturday and that values "the pledge of both parts by stabilizing our financial market and to protect our economy". 
Limitation of the armored contract 
The president of the banking Committee of the senate, Christopher Dodd, leader of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the money of the program for the protection of the taxes of the taxpayers of their losses, a closure aliviadora of the plan of finances planned. 
The new law should also limit the calls armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and creates a committee that will have a control of the Fund. 
This it would have that to direct it the Department of Finances. 
"We have worked very harshly in it, and we have carried out a great advance in direction to the covenant that will function and that will be efficient for the market and for all the Americans", commented Paulson. 
The plan counts also with helping the owners of houses that have problems with its payments. 
The government would have that to be put according to the new payments of the mortgages that buy in order to descending the monthly loads of the payments by installment of the debtors and to enable them that they can be remained with their houses. 
Marek: psychological aid 
The plan proposed is, according to the chief economist of Country Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be carried out but quite difficult. 
"And it is for this that themselves is not known with what mechanism and why price the problematic assets will be bought. 
This will be decisive for the distribution of the losses between the financial sector and the government", said Marek this week, for the servant iHNed.cz. 
That the plan be approved now or at the beginning of the next week is not, according to Marek, so prominent. 
"A lot more important is that, already this week the congresspersons come to an agreement in its support and they give him its seen good all it before that be able. 
This important and psychological agreement that arrive at that approval is, in these moments, it more important", insisted Marek. 
Fights armed: the Reproductive one of MP3 against the mobile one. 
We advise him as to elect 
While almost all mobile reproduces files of MP3, no reproductive one of MP3 manages to do calls. 
What seems clearly that is better to be bought only the telephone. 
Even so sufficient motives exist like so that the man acquire only the reproductive one. 
The election depends practically in the way of its use and of the demand of the proprietary future. 
Probably it will be difficult that acquire the most modern record player to listen in it the last album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the other hand this type of musical products as are the disks of LP no longer leave, and in which refers to its quality does not exist neither objective a single reason to continue buying them. 
If they crowd in its bookcases the disks of vinyl with music of art rock, jazz or blues, probably is dreaming, at least, with this type of record player. 
This is the same thing with the music that is of road, that is to say, the music compressed, simplified - the music in MP3. 
And here categories of price they exist and quality. 
For some it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns in a reproductive one, the same thing as for a lover of Pink Floyd that with difficulty will test the helmets of street market from to twenty crowns. 
Two extremes, among which there is sufficient space for each one. 
The election is extensive. 
Also it decides the duration of the battery 
Some of the better reproductive they obtain a lot more than only reproduce music and even that that not even the majority of the mobile. 
No current apparatus is as universal as the telephone. 
Set against the most elementary functions as to telephone, to send messages, can reproduce music and video, to record the two, has a better or worse apparatus of photography and even can manage to sail. 
And when we take in consideration the Smartphone and the PDA are going to have in its pocket also a small computer. 
This is a small miracle since any refrigerator knows to do a grill and any television can photograph. 
The universality of the mobile brings us also disadvantages. 
As many more functions utilize in the mobile one before the indicator of the screen asking to be reloaded will be illuminated. 
And the reproduction of music is one of the greater greedy of energy. 
Few are the mobile that manage to reproduce music more than ten or twelve hours, the much less majority. 
In this sense, the reproductive of music (especially the simplest) have clearly a greater performance. 
Therefore, they keep in mind that the mobile cheap they will not reproduce more than two hours. 
If besides this, on top, they call constantly are obtained still, for more security, a dockhand for the work - this is valid also for the most expensive apparatuses. 
With the reproductive one of MP3 this problem does not be going to have it, therefore even the worst endure as a minimum 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load. 
Another problem happens upon recording music in the mobile one. 
Unfortunately only a part of the apparatuses has the universal connector USB and, besides, not all they can be connected directly to the computer without a special software. 
Of course that is possible to record music directly in the card by memory but only in some reading units without reduction can be connected the small cards by memory that are utilized in the mobile. 
In the reproductive, with some exception (iPod), is necessary no special software. 
It suffices with filling the apparatus with music through the USB of the computer. 
The majority of mobile and reproductive they create alone their order in the musical library according to the name of the interpreter, title of the album, kind or also according to the appraisal of user. 
Some apparatuses only show a board of directors with structure of tree seemed to a search Engine of Windows and some they recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the intelligent telephones with operating system). 
The reproductive one tries to serve, the mobile one knows more 
For the election of a concrete team be interested for the resistance of the collector, by the capacity of the memory, by the quality and the type at the outset of sound and, of course, by the comfort of its management. 
If listens, above all, the music as fund and each day is going to listen it only a while, like in the trolley, then suffices him with any mobile one that reproduce. 
What practically obtains truly any mobile one. 
Does not it owe not even to be interested of the format in which the mobile one or the reproductive one they reproduce the music. 
The MP3 they reproduce it all and, practically, almost all the music that arrive will be him in this format. 
It is found among the most extended and excepting him him the simple majority of the apparatuses they reproduce music in format WMA. 
The less they include the format AAC (format utilized by the business Apple and their iPod). 
The better mobile they enable also, for example, the on-line music purchase. 
It suffices through the internet of the mobile one to visit the competent pages of the user (or of any another lender of services) and to be bought a song or an album. 
This service could be in and of itself an argument of weight to acquire a mobile one for music. 
Unfortunately the offering of the users is miserable and the majority is limited alone to the themes of fleeting success of the radios. 
The prices are neither the lowest. 
Nevertheless, in general, is supposed that exactly this music sale way (whether for GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the industry of the music. 
The majority of the people always carries on top a mobile one. 
Provided that him desire to listen something, will find the mobile one in its pocket, while the reproductive one of MP3 will remain forgot at home. 
Nevertheless, still it depends if carries always with himself some headphones or, at least, the handsfree. 
If it is not thus, can use a reproductive one integrated that has practically each mobile one although be as a minimum a reproductive one of MP3. 
Probably the greater advantage for many of the mobile with music will be its price. 
The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand crowns already can acquire a good one walkman. 
To the majority of you the absence of an entrance for classical headphones will limit them. 
The better, even in which refers to the technical part, like the telephones equipped with an entrance of 3.5 mm. for some classical headphones, they cost until fifteen thousand. 
Again, the advantage of the reproductive is not another thing that its easy service. 
The reproductive simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest (to see our selection) - handles her really any person. 
The minimum functions, its management seemed to the previous current cassette players or also to the record player is evident. 
Does not it represent a threat in the sense that by misconception we connect us to internet with the mobile one and, consequently, gigantic account by lowering of data. 
By which apparatus to be decided 
Even the mobile cheapest (for example, the Vodafone 527) they consider general rule a slot to change the card by memory (type M2, microcomputer SD, etc.). 
Even with the purchase of an adequate card will arrive at two o'clock thousand crowns. 
Nevertheless, they be careful. 
The basic models, normally they are equipped only with a card of 2 GB of maximum capacity. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If already it has a mobile one and wants to be bought still a reproductive market of MP3, have a quick look to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
According to the capacity (at most 2 GB) does not do lack to be spent more than 1,100 crowns. 
If it is considered from among the most exacting lovers of the music make use of the mobile-walkman more specialized (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These apparatuses have independent keys for the MP3 what does a service as comfortable as that of a same reproductive one. 
The most it specialized one of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile of the line walkman have almost identical use as that of a reproductive one of MP3 independent. 
The same service and the same category as for price, on the four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity by memory (to 16 GB) and of collector (normally of 15 hours, with a maximum performance of to 35 hours), the mark cited more mule train brings them reproductive of MP3. 
The first virtual user already is going to arrive, this year, to the Czech Republic. 
Probably 
The market of mobile in the Czech Republic is enough developed and our users offer practically all the services as their associates of Europe western. 
Nevertheless, here something it lacks us still - the virtual user, that would oblige those to be cheaper. 
Probably it is not going to delay in arriving. 
That the Czech users form part of the most expensive of Europe, already we have it written in mobil.cz. 
The remainder confirmed it also the Office of the Czech Telecommunication that alerted that the price of the messages SMS in our country is of the most expensive of all the Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the country of the regulation of the rates of roaming probably arrive at a paradoxical situation - for some clients of the Czech mobile users the SMS that send since the foreigner they will be cheaper than if they send them from house. 
How it is possible that the prices in the Czech Republic be maintained so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, lack competence that really want to fight. 
Probably this seem us paradoxical, therefore we have three networks of mobile and its high cover is of more than the 100%. 
On the contrary, the users of mobile like to be regretted that in the Czech market there is an extreme competence. 
Of it also the president of the Counsel of the Office of Czech Telecommunications Pavel already expressed that already there is not place in the Czech Republic for no another user. 
It is perhaps truth that for a classical user with its own network no longer have too many possibilities (for the remainder, would be well difficult to find some frequency). 
Nevertheless, a possibility exists still - the virtual user. 
Exactly the entrance of the virtual user in the market of the mobile phone system brought a noticeable descent of prices before which the classical users should react also. 
At the same time, still before the entrance of sharks as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market of Great Britain voices seemed listened themselves so much there like here. 
It was shown that place for this type of users exists and that are successful. 
Otherwise, does not it do lack to seek examples too far. 
In February of this year we report them on the premiere of the virtual user Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half a year, this user managed to obtain more than 100 thousand clients and to be become the fifth user larger of the neighboring country. 
On the other hand, after Mobilking the group is found Penta that, aside from it, in the Czech Republic is the owner of OR: fon. 
The advantage of the virtual users is in the possibility to be concentrate on many more groups concrete goal. 
Besides, so that they can function of effective form, suffices them with many less clients than a classical user. 
They do not carry with himself relatively large expenses in construction, operation and maintenance of the network. 
In the world this type of virtual users normally they are outlined with low expenses - they offer calls and messages of SMS cheap that nevertheless, often is counteracted with the most adjusted offering of services. 
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS as a minimum the half of cheap with regard to the competence. 
Nevertheless, like sample the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a good blow also the bets on a nothing trivial group put. 
This user is directed specifically the man. 
"The correct man chooses Mobilking - is the user that likes and in who can he be trusted", David says Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, that works this virtual user. 
It is difficult to say if seemed concept like that of Poland would be able to hook in our country. 
Of it doubts the spokesman of Vodafone, Miroslav. "The Czech market is relatively small to agree for segments in which they are based the majority of the virtual users. 
Besides since the point of view of the offering of services is relatively saturated" 
In the Czech Republic there is not possibilities, the users say of mobile 
Nevertheless, insurance seems almost that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual user that will not be Mobilking. 
"We are speaking on the expansion of this successful project, nevertheless, in the R. Czech does not seem too encouraging. 
More well it is a matter of the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region", said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Janus spokesman of the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly it assured that the current users of mobile phone system in the Czech Republic finally themselves do not incline before this idea. 
More well the contrary thing, they try to do everything possible so that not any potential competence arise. 
Interest on the launch of a virtual user of mobile already the group shows it GTS Novera that wanted to take a step further on to be become a competence real of Telephone O2 in the country of the clients of businesses. 
"We have a great interest in it, to be able to offer our clients not only services of fixed phone system but also of mobile phone system. 
And how much before, better. 
With this possibility we have found us repeatedly with all the Czech users of mobile phone system. 
With some of them we have managed to advance in the meetings", the spokesman of the group said, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, perhaps better times flash. 
Seems to be that, by not official information, the first official user would have that to arrive possibly already to ends of year. 
But for now its apparition is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence. 
"In these moments we believe that the situation is suitable for the apparition of a virtual user in the Czech market. 
The Czech market in comparison with other is a very specific market. 
To the present nobody has been directed to us with some serious and complex project in this land", he expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil spokesman of Telephone O2. 
Of the specificity of the Czech market they refer other users. 
The spokesman of T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with the opinion of O2, adds: "Until today unregistered no viable commercial project that, bilateral beneficial, can continue being developed." 
And it adds: "In the network of T-Mobile will be difficult to find some virtual user until the end of year. 
At this time already we should have on the table some concrete contract that was possible to study in so short horizon" 
Vodafone directs its attention more well to the compliance of the own requests of a license 3G. 
Miroslav adds: "We are open to the negotiations with potential virtual users, and this in which refers to the distribution of expenses and infrastructure. 
Exactly we consider it as the greater contribution since the point of view of the clients. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field is found in the associate with whom establishing a network shared for a fast internet in the mobile one." 
Responsible offices - with the users nail and meat 
The progress of the users of mobile can be understood easily, but the entrance of another user would signify to enlarge the competence what would involve to a lowering of prices and with it, to a descent of the profits. 
Then ¿Why to facilitate the entrance to the competence? 
When the users want to obtain something, they are capable of throwing of a same cord, test of it is the pull when arose OR: fon. 
Perhaps the greater pressure to it was at the moment of the entrance of OR: fon by the company T-Mobile. 
The accessible public information in the web pages testifies it of the. 
But exactly now OR: fon serves as argument by what not to accept a virtual user. 
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "Ademas, does not do a lot that the competitive environment in the market of the mobile phone system was opened a fourth user. 
In which refers the character of the market of the mobile phone system in the Czech Republic is natural that the entrance of another player in the market would suppose for him and, above all, for its services large requests." 
Is for this that this access to the users of mobile is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulating organ. 
Itself does not treat only of the position from the which unfortunately does not have any competence in intervening in the commercial tenders, as opposed to Great Britain and other countries developed. 
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (ÚOHS). 
Nevertheless, this expressed its typical position before this problems. 
"The entrance of a virtual user to the market of the mobile phone system would be possible after closed a covenant on the rent of the necessary infrastructure between an user of mobile phone system and a virtual user. 
Until today no covenant has been closed since the offering of the potentials interested more well went not it sufficient interesting for the classical users", added to our question Kristián Boat, of the department of Foreign Affairs of the ÚOHS. 
These they formulated statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators. 
For the offices that should represent the interests of the consumers is a matter of something more than a consideration, aside from it they should observe that nobody take advantage of their position in the market. 
Especially when Kristián Boat adds: "Abroad where the virtual users function with normality we can observe that its entrance in the market contributed to the lowering of prices of the services of mobile phone system" 
Evidently, the pressure as for the correct operation of the media of the market and the lowering of prices do not they enter inside the interest of the ÚOHS. 
Really it dramatic shocking in all this case rests in the dissonant reactions that result of the three mobile users. 
The question of if really is a matter of a coincidence, is offered for itself alone. 
Is the same thing as with the price of the gasoline in the gas stations therefore is clear that is work of the coincidence and of a hard fight by the competence. 
"The Office in this sense has not found signs of unfair competition and does not consider so much motives for of some way to intervene. 
None of the users considers a consequent dominant position do not they have a corresponding ascent of responsibility in their actions in the market. 
The necessary tools to open the market of the mobile phone system to the virtual users, more well, they lack, as well as the regulators of telecommunication", added to its answer Boat. 
The interpretation on the dominant position in the market is one of the many troubled points. 
Evidently an analysis of prominent markets exists elaborated by the according to which the telecommunications are since the point of view of the commercial tender an only market. 
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech users has a dominant position. 
Nevertheless some of the legal experts they offer another vision - so that arise a virtual user is always necessary the agreement with the administrator of the network. 
And the user of the mobile phone system - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network. 
Therefore, in a concrete segment should be necessarily dominant. 
And if this argument not to be accepted, at least for ÚOHS should represent a warning the fact that three operators of mobile elevate gaudily of form seemed. 
The current complaints of them interested (inluida cited it company GTS Novera) they show that in all the negotiations with the operators they collide with many impediments seemed. 
Charging the responsibility in it is a quite common trick in the country of the telecommunications of which the ÚOHS washes the hands in all this matter. 
We have found us with him already in some cases seemed. 
Unfortunately it does little time was presented a new amendment to the law of telecommunications for the enlargement of the competence of the in the country of the commercial tenders that itself was not carried to effect, still when a series of specialists they promised that the situation would improve. 
This the representatives should know it perfectly of ÚOHS, but is evident that its interests are found in another part. 
All goes well, when nobody looks 
At the same time, unnoticed continues functioning something as well as an user pseudovirtual that in the Czech mobile phone networks already a few exist. 
They are businesses that put their own prices to the services of mobile phone system that, nevertheless, only a part are public. 
Normally it is a matter of businesses that are dedicated to the marketing multinivel. 
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and other many offer its own services of mobile phone system. 
Normally only some chosen they obtain the price list of these businesses. 
The magic is in which the business, with regard to the operator, acts as a classical business client of the same one entrusting a large quantity of cards SIM. 
As special client will receive later special prices and other offerings. 
The problem is in which the commercial conditions in all the Czech users of mobile phone system prohíben that type of resale. 
"If be to discovered cases like the ones that quotes would be able to speak of infraction in the conditions of contract that would be able to be translated in the end of the contribution with the company given", responded to the question on this problem Martina Kemrová. 
But it is quite improbable that an activity of this type carried out on the part of the users of mobile phone system did not arrive at responsible people. 
Exactly in the case of the three businesses cited can come be treated of thousands of clients. 
None of the users is against this procedure. 
With the activities of these businesses they obtain some profits despicable nothing and, at the same time - as opposed to the authentic virtual users - by no means they threaten their own official marketing. 
Miroslav notifies us of the possible problems: "The law permits a speculation of this type, nevertheless, the services of this business are utilized only by a contemptible so much percent of clients. 
These, besides, they should accept that the card SIM of their telephone be not to their name for which they cannot arrange absolutely of him as a normal client of the operators." 
Exactly this is what should seem to the most minimum strange one. 
Besides a new question for the ÚOHS appears. 
If it is that the operators of mobile phone system half-close the eyes in this type of procedure, ¿why do they block the entrance of the virtual user? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has the sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if is that is not going to want should not be pleased with the explanations of the operators that do not they have neither idea of this history and of that its commercial conditions do not permit it. 
When will stop being the most expensive 
As already it remained clearly in the text, the entrance of the virtual user in the market of the mobile phone system brought a significant descent in the prices of the services. 
At the same time, practically in all the countries where the virtual user arose, the classical operators tried more or less to be protected of this raid. 
The arguments utilized by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too much saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc. 
In the most they advanced countries, nevertheless, in these moments they have intervened the regulating organs and in none of the cases they defended the operators but to their clients. 
Already it was with formal measures or informal pressure they achieved that to arise the first virtual user and with him they began to arise other more. 
Unfortunately, the Czech Organ of Regulation all this case passes it as if was a matter of a nail burning. 
By our experience not to can stop impressing us that the confusion of the attributions in these cases they agree them. 
But us do not we despair. 
If it is that this information among frames is correct and the virtual user really arrives at these lands, then the Czech market of the mobile phone system probably harms to be moved again. 
If some of the operators lets in some virtual user of mobile phone system will be difficult that the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other interested. 
And we perhaps to will stop calling more expensive than in the remainder of Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official hymn. 
Sunday, the prime minister Mirek Topolánek from time to time of the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home. 
The new hymn recorded it the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of. 
There are available four versions - two versions that are Alone, a to male voice and another to female voice, another with Chorus and another instrumental one. 
Of the song they are entrusted and Adam Plachetka. 
The authors of the arrangements of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav. 
In the servant iHNed.cz can listen the four versions. 
It considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
The Czech Radio already said before that deliberately chose for the Alone singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular. 
"Since the principle I have tried with the two and later, also, with the Chorus that noticed the diction so that the text well to be understood, so that had harmony", commented. 
The Czech official hymn celebrates the next year its 175 anniversary. 
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in the year 1834 in the boards of the Theater of the States in the original Czech work of Josef Kajetán Tyl and fixed with the music of František Škroup. 
It won popularity and the people did it its. 
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 was converted, of natural form, in a part of the official hymn. 
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the rise of the independent Czech Republic. 
How does it sound the "new" hymn 
The MHD of Prague Wednesday carries us for the first time with the chip 
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the shipping Company from Prague the date in which the first passing they enter to the meter, to the trolley and to the bus with an electronic bond in their pockets instead of a bill of role. 
This it can be acquired in these moments by almost a hundred thousand people that possess the card of chip Opencard. 
The passengers can buy the bond of 30 days, 90 days and the annual one (this will be been worth from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously to charge it in its card of chip in the infocentros and positions of the shipping company in the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, Holešovice, Roztyly, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, and Luka. 
The bonds can be bought already since yesterday on the internet in the pages of the shipping company, www.dpp.cz. 
The service, to the afternoon, was utilized for more than four hundred people. 
Those that harm to use the internet as a way of commerce, they can begin finally to be forgot of the bills sale positions in the stations of the meter, where up to now regularly they should do queue to be removed a normal bill. 
The bond is bought on the internet, and the card Opencard reload it you in some of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library. 
"In these places there is at the disposal of the passengers a window with personnel prepared that helps to him interested with the purchase by internet and also with the refill of the bond bought in his card", the spokesman of the project said, Martin Opatrný. 
Aside from the library, will also be possible to reload the electronic bond in the Opencard in the automatic machines expendedoras that are found in some vestibules of the meter. 
How are these machines expendedoras? 
They are red, they recall us to a machine to sting bills and the travelers probably already will have noticed them in the stations of the meter of Roztyly, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Now there is in the city five but to ends of year would have that to have eighty", completed Opatrný. 
The bond is controlled for the machine instead of the conductor 
The use of the machine, that will begin to function tomorrow, is simple. 
It suffices with introducing in her the card of chip Opencard and the previously full bond will be charged only in her. 
The bonds electronic from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its outskirts. 
That is to say, in the trains of bypass and lines of buses since the numbers 300 until 499 that use chiefly the inhabitants of the localities of Bohemia central. 
"In the trains adhering to the transportation integrated of Prague there are inspectors equipped with a reading card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bond", thus explained the control of the bills, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the public transportation of Prague. 
The buses of bypass have its mounted reading cards in the ticket window of the conductor. 
Upon entering is necessary not only to show the card to the conductor but besides is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place destined for it in the side of the Box. 
With it, the conductor controls the validity of the bond. 
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than requesting the conductor this information", completed Drápal. 
The passengers that do not travel in the buses of bypass and they recall not when is finishes the validity of the bond they can be directed to the machines expendedoras where the cards are reloaded. 
Here, in the screen of the machine, will be shown them the information on the validity of its document. 
The southeast they wanted to form part of United States in a referendum 
The Sudetes German asked in the year 1945 that Smoked formed part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted of the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemia Southern. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this desire they were directed, likely, some groups of Germans of the Sudetes to the president of United States in the year 1945. 
It results of the letters that are kept in a private file and that today they are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemia Southern. 
The Germans of Krumlov request in a letter to the American president that do not permit the refund of the "land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler in base to the Pact of Munich - again to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood correctly the situation and we want truly its word that the American units are arriving at German lands not as the oppressors neither enemy but like liberating" is written in the letter, signed with a "the people that carries the destiny of Šumava in its heart". 
In view that the union of Czechoslovakia with the German southeast likely supposes - according to these the Czech national character - an alone hope in the brutality, thoughtlessness, lack of understanding, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president that assume for the present and for always to Šumava under a protectorate. 
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants deliver us to a foreign state that presses and rejects to the minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of the allies", is written in the letter. 
The reason by which the authors cannot sign is likely the fear to retaliations of the "oppressive Czech". 
If the president of United States likely doubted on this idea of the Germans šumavos, he would suffice with organizing in the lands šumavas a referendum on if its inhabitants want to form part of United States or to live under their patronage. 
In spite of the fact that the text of the letter, with the know-how that we have current of the history of postwar period, a little childlike can sound us, according to some specialists paints rightly the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of then. 
Although the Germans Czech should sense most minimum that was going to treat on its expulsion of the republic only some few admitted this possibility. 
Some they expected that the United States and Great Britain negotiated for the Sudetes clear any way of autonomy. 
Other they believed that they will remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The Austrian journalist confirms him even Gustav Boat, born in. 
This was in the war, like the German of enrolado in the navy of the Baltic one. 
When in the end of the war the British they rushed it and they summoned to court it in the country of prisoners of Holstein scores of German they went him so that taught them Czech. 
"They believed that upon returning home, the Czech would be suitable them", Boat said. 
None of the German prisoners that lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, included that in base to the Decrees of Benes they would be far away of the Republic. 
Do not you think - ¡pay! 
Emotional campaign attacks the conductors 
The most expensive action in the Czech history directed to the security in the highways. 
That way would be able to characterize the emotional Campaign that decided to launch Wednesday the Department of Transportations in the media. 
The office of the minister, Go himš promises that will dissuade the conductors of dangerous conducts to the steering wheel. 
The campaign of 150 million will cause feel in the television, radio, movies, internet and in pamphlets. 
It would have that to dissuade the conductor of the high speed and of the alcohol to the steering wheel. 
And also to recall them that before being set in motion the belts be tied. 
Wants to arrive at the conscience above all of the conductive youths, motorcycle riders, pedestrians and in last place also of the professional conductors. 
And what is what we can see in the announcements? 
Fundamentally human histories that charge to the emotions. 
And for it the announcements they testify it us "bloodthirsty" during all the campaign: 
Do not you think - ¡pay! 
The word "do Not you think" is written with large letters in the registration. 
And in a puddle of blood is the word "pay". 
This should symbolize that the man in a moment of forgetfulness can come he pay with his own life. 
The announcements go to "to put fear" to the spectators to the year 2010. 
The Department was left to inspire for the campaign performed in Anglo-saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed. 
It promises that of that way will reduce the accidents and the number of dead persons in the Czech highways. 
The announcements have been elaborate by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for the conductors 
"For the conductors is worth the system of sugar and whip. 
Sugar is for him when, for example, a signal is passed in red and thus saves time. 
The whip is threat of fine or accident. 
To the conductors should recall him himself the risks", the psychologist of transportations of the hospital says Na Homolce, Martin. 
And therefore is necessary an informative campaign in the press and chiefly a concrete, negative publicity the psychologist. 
Less troops, for him, are the boards that notify the conductor of the dangers. 
"If there is some board installed notifying of some probably quick danger will fuse with the environment and the conductor will not lend him greater attention", notified. 
Olmert would return almost all the busy zones in exchange for the peace 
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, was pronounced on the restitution of practically all the busy lands in the year 1967, that is to say, West Bank, Jerusalem this and the High of the Golán, in exchange for the peace with Palestine and Syrian. 
It proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the daily one Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We should reach an agreement with the Palestinians what signifies that necessarily we should return almost all the lands (busy) if is that not all", said Olmert to the newspaper. 
"Sure that we will remain with a little percent of these lands, but to the Palestinians we should yield them a percent seemed (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will not be peace", added. 
It admitted that in case of restitution Jerusalem would be included also this. 
"That that want security in Jerusalem and therefore want not that the tractors or even excavators above their legs as passed to one of my better friends, then will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem", aimed Olmert in reference to the two attacks of July in the city in which there were various dead persons and scores of people were injuries. 
According to the president will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historic place" that is found in the interior of the old city. 
"That that want to maintain the Israelite sovereignty in all the city will have to integrate to 270,000 Arabs. 
This will not function", insisted further on. 
Withdrawal of the High of the Golán 
Olmert was pronounced also by the withdrawal of Israel of the High of the Golán what since its point of view is an inherent condition to close a peace agreement with Syria. 
But this would suppose also some concrete efforts on the part of Damascus. 
"Do not I propose to close the peace with Syria only in the base of the withdrawal of the Golán", notified. 
"The Syrians know well of what will they have to be removed to win the Golán. 
They should abandon its current relations with Iran, they should abandon its relations with the Hizbulá (movement anklebone), they should be removed of the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (movement anklebone), of al-qaeda (the terrorist network) and of the Jihad (the crusade) in Iraq", summarized the prime minister. 
You ask after the accident: They are illegal the hostesses in the buses? 
The law is a stranger, himself he cannot walk in a bus of long distance 
In relation to the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova the question arises us of if the hostesses and passengers can be moved for the bus during the trip. 
"If we wanted strict and formally to comply with the law, the activity of the hostess is opposed to the law of road traffic", the spokesman of the department of Transportation says, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in which last week died the hostess of twenty-two years, evidently was caused by the conductor of the truck only that the bus was crossed on the road. 
The girl, unfortunately, was found seated next to the conductor in the place less sure of the vehicle in spite of having reserved other two places. 
Nevertheless, the bus can have an accident or to brake suddenly, and in the I need moment in which the azafato distributes the coffee or the newspapers. 
Here what plays the role is if the bus is found gifted, according to the technical permission, with places from on foot. 
If the bus is not endorsed, the passenger should go seated. 
The buses of long distances of Student Agency do not have places to go standing, what confirmed the director of the business, Radim to. 
"This we have solved it with the department and, in principle, the movement of the passengers is not permitted. 
Finally this they withdrew it and we arrive at the agreement that the passengers can go to the bath being the bus in motion if is that they possess seat", its position commented us. 
The hostess does not know the law 
"Not an evident legal interpretation of the role of exists the hostess - any legal disposition clarifies this function. 
Not even any legal disposition prohíbe to the carriers to carry out some service. 
The law of haulage only knows the vehicles Inspector term, whose right and obligations are not you defined", adds, less categorically, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the vehicles Traffic department by highway of the Department of Transportations, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law attends sufficiently this problems. 
"It depends on if the bus has the endorsement permitted to have places from on foot. 
That is all", says. 
The buses are divided among the urban, where there are places to be standing and of maximum velocity limited, intercity with places for be standing with a greater permission of velocity and the of long distances without places for go standing, with the major permission of velocity and with the seats equipped with seat belt. 
As in the airplane, the expert says 
The expert of BESIP in Security in the transportation, Jaroslav does not see important problems as for the movement of the azafato in the bus. 
"During the development of the trip there is not a lot of threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service in the airplanes. 
Not even here it has the security that the turmoils arrive and that the hostess can be struck in the head." 
"Nevertheless, if the bus brakes suddenly evidently that are valid the physical laws. 
The same thing as in an urban bus or in the trolley. 
The security of the hostess should solve it the internal regulation of the trucker", says and also thinks that since the point of view of the law this problems is without solving. 
it is prepared to annul this service 
Student Agency is the only trucker that offers the service of hostesses. 
It employs in it to two hundred. 
The director, neither after the accident, considers that work risked. 
"Nevertheless, just as have the impression that the position of hostess is risked, then I will suppress it. 
The coffee and the newspapers can receive it, the passengers, upon entering. 
It would save even expenses", says. 
In interest to the security is the reason why Asiana lacks hostesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, that directs a small line in comparison with LTD. 
"Do not we have hostesses, we are against them since the principle. 
Before or later this will finish in a fatal accident", said does less than one year for Týden.cz. 
Happened an enormous tragedy 
In the accident of the line that joins with Naples died a young hostess of Beer that had worked for the company two years. 
A Slovene truck that probably rotated since the rail of parking blocking the step to the bus. without utilizing the intermittent. 
Its conductor tried in a fast maneuver to avoid it, nevertheless, he collided with the front right part. 
It denies that they were sold the two places that are reserved for the rest of the hostess. 
"These places is not possible to reserve them for connections of long distances, they are blocked." 
The business intends to demand the conductor of the truck. 
The agency is not going to expect to the verdict of the judgment on the compensation of the family of the girl but wait the financial expenses also by the part of the guilty one. 
It reforms of the law? 
Not, for now 
The reform of the law would be able to bring a greater precision on the movement of the hostess in the bus in which since it has been a year that they are working thirty member experts of a group of the Department of Transportations. 
"Nevertheless, they have not arrived at some concrete conclusion. 
Himself they are not dedicated too much to the buses, but more well to the system of points, maximum velocity in freeway and the use of the mobile one during the march", the expert says. 
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity of the hostesses something that threaten in an important way the security of the passengers", finishing the spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of the security in the buses is competence of the police and the Office of Security in the work. 
The hope of Dusseldorf is supported in Francfort 
In the letter of the board of directors of the bank West LB for their collaborators do not they lack large words. 
By the fusion of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA can be formed `un central market of capitals of the financial group of Sparkassen', as says it the writing, published Monday 
The bank West LB, breaking the `bloco of competence' with sustainable capacity of benefits would enter such business. 
Besides, a such fusion can be a beginning for following fusions in the environment of regional banks. 
Thus it comes the text understand, when a board of directors wants to show capacity to act in hard times. 
Because the same as before the West LB is found under an enormous pressure. 
Not alone of the part of the European Union, but also of the federal institute of the caution of the financial products that does little has done clear to the government of the Rhineland north-Westfalia that remains little time to find a solution. 
Already since a time ago, also of the part of Francfort, is spoken a lot on the union of such type among the bank DEKA, that the clients of Sparkasse know for their investment funds, and the West LB. 
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the leader of the bank DEKA, presenting the data after a half a year to the end of August left to know that sees no sense in the fusion of the bank, situated in the street Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank as for example the Chilled or the West LB. 
But the board meeting of the DEKA, that now is composed by the regional banks and the associations of Sparkassen, entrusted to board of directors to begin negotiations with the West LB on the common commercial activities. 
In this would be able to try a business in the capital market or some parts of him. 
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, thus is said in the financial place. 
Is not the first time when is a matter of the consolidation in the environment of Sparkassen appears the name of the bank DEKA that with its 3000 collaborators figure among more important businessmen in the financial place Francfort. 
In 2003 in a moment the situation seemed so the bank DEKA would be able to fuse with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Chilled. 
This initiative to create a union of three parties remained without results. 
Barely the plans were make public, the government of Hesse was expressed against the participation of the Chilled in this project. 
The other two banks also not found the same language. 
Instead of that the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the I talk with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg. 
But it was played always again with the idea of fusion of the bank DEKA with other regional banks. 
But finally Günther Merl, the president of the board of directors of the Chilled, he expressed that he was against of the plans of the coexistence with his bank. 
Independent of that seems to be clearer than the union of the different banks of the environment of public right is necessary. 
Therefore, when they are going to pass the elections of the parliament of Bavaria, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg would be able to do progresses. 
For the Chilled that results not necessarily some good news. 
If the pressure to continue fusing will enlarge, to Chilled the associates they will lack him to carry out that. 
In the south the bank could be alone a young associate, although up to now he excelled a lot better than the financial crisis that the real estate they did it of Stuttgart and Munich. 
Of another part the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, that possesses the 85 percent of the Chilled, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB. 
In every case remains alone the Nord LB. 
But such geostrategic reflections form they are alone a part. 
Of another part is a matter of the compatibility of the different banking models. 
In June Merl asked a fundamental question on a commercial model that could guarantee the future for the regional banks, to that the deutsche Sparkassen- und Turn- Verband up to now did not give any answer. 
In end breaks down the West LB, but that, naturally, is not the own desire of the bank. 
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank is said that would try to find a complete solution for all the bank 
As the coexistence among singular parts of the bank with the DEKA can be arranged, that is going to show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest known as "the weekend of the Italians" 
For Elena is the first time, to light up already the third one or quarter. 
But this time, to you grasped him him Elena as its girlfriend, and therefore all seems different, he says.

At night the buses already are on the road in the freeway with the direction "Brennero"

It is well thus, they will need still the forces. 
Itself for to Brixen and to Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration do an another pause in the road 8 little before Munich. 
At last, when the group of Framework has the predicted arrival at 6,30 o'clock of early morning in the parking next to the Field of Teresa, there already there is circa 50 other buses from across europe. 
Elena, light up and the other they gather, Framework has its last speech on the way to proceed.

Second: "When the doors of the store of the campaign are opened, that signifies ¡to go!", shouts Framework in the early morning. 
"¡To go!" Going and to occupy the back places in the store of the campaign. 
"¡Do not you take the places of before, because we are going to block, and all with yellow caps do not sit down in the same stool, distributed by every space!" 
A liter of beer, roars Framework, slope 8,25 euro. 
Do not you forget the tip 
You show to the people of security that we have good tone! 
Barely it leaves himself the place, he already will be occupied!" 
Third: "¡This late one exactly at half past ten you have to arrive here!" You have understood? 
And now all they go to the Oktoberfest. 
One, to mark the road, ties the yellow caps in the trees, road signs and even in a placard of the elections of a great Popular Party of Bavaria. 
It is desired to be able to recognize the road behind. 
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known like "the weekend of the Italians"

The nights without sleeping for the creditors of the Hypo Real you Be you 
The banking system of Germany is relatively stable, accentuated alone last week the federal minister of Finances Peter Steinbrück. 
That well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and he added that the German banking environment will also be affected of the critical tendencies. 
And that has occurred after weekend. 
Hypo Real you Be you (HRE), the financier of real estate of Munich, that is quoted in the index DAX, receives of a consortium of the German banks a credit of billion to be able to do resistance to the turmoils in the market. 
Monday a person that knows very well the situation told Reuters: the credit aids elevated until 35 billion euro. 
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real you Be you is going to use has to throw interest. 
The money originates as of the private banks also of those of right public. 
The cause of that are the losses of the subsidiary one Depfa. 
According to a report, the state financiers with the money that was lent for the long-term projects they financed them alone a brief period- what now, on account of the distrust in the markets, is not more possible. 
In the first half from the year the reserve of capital of the bank in cash there is fall in 95 percent, 2,37 million euro, also the quota of the own capital delayed a little 1,6 percent to 1,45 percent. 
In comparison with the same period of last year the continuous incomes of financial investments and net profits of financial operations fell to the zero, the incomes of accusation for debtors and some titles of values also the of the dissolution of provisions of the credit business spreaded downward of more 70 percent, in 5 million euro. 
Alone thanks to the high and many incomes of the reimbursements of the expenses of clearing of the restructuring of the former-group Depfa as well as to the reimbursement of interests according to the federal code of taxes and to the business organized for the businesses of the consortium, the negative balance would be able to accuse a deficit with approximately at 16 percent more. 
After his privatization in the year 1990 the former state financier at the beginning was lost in speculations with the industrial credits for the real estate, what served of reason for foundation of the bank Aareal. 
As itself not a lot of money with the financing of the state projects could be won, the Defa began to be dedicated intensively to the projects in the environment of infrastructure and of the financing of the common projects by the state as well as and private investors (you Deprive you-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified. 
Now the Hypo Real you Be you has to carry out repayments on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the account consolidated of losses and profits of the group, is said very inexactly. 
It is a fact that have canceled the dividends. 
Already for the year 2007 they were canceled to two thirds. 
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real you Be you became an important financier state and financier in the environment of the infrastructure. 
As the bank does not possess the deposits client, he, in comparison with other banks, results to be more clerk of the refinancing in the interbank market. 
With the bankruptcy of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers, what has occurred two weeks ago, the concession of the interbank credits descended essentially because the banks were saving its liquidity. 
Each year the Hypo Real you Be you needs almost 50 billion euro to finance a credit accounts receivable part of the Defa of its short-term measures for the refinancing. 
According to the report of the Hypo Real you Be you, the bank covers with a credit the need of the financing of the group for a brief time and the business is insured of "the influence of the international money markets that now essentially are not eligible to function" 
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed to the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, the president of the board of directors of the Hypo Real you Be you, explained that the Hypo Real Be you Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time. 
The German central bank and the federal institute of the caution of the financial products (BaFin) leave from the base that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real you Be you Group from now on is insured. 
That they have to expect the shareholders and the creditors of the bank. 
But on account of the dynamics and of the imponderability of the crisis there is not constancy. 
Even it is imaginable that have not that to need the financing in its complete volume. 
But itself not the contrary case can be excluded. 
It ran the voice that in the last minute from Sunday the bank still was found almost in insolvency, therefore the temporary salvation does neither calm down at least people worried. 
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3,30 euro. 
The courses of loan, on the contrary, they are truly well. 
While the priority debts almost do not change, the courses of the loans according to the position in the registration of the property spread clearly downward. 
They affected are above all the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with the reason the loans whose expirations surpass 2009. 
After the notable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real you Be you, the current value of its loans that before were an investment for speculations one must consider as the clerk of the stability of the international financial system. 
While the issuing banks, the governments and the banks that are little affected still be ready to support the system, in the meantime can leave itself from the repayment of pensions inside time limit. 
Or it is going to occur something, what itself is risked to imagine nobody- the financial crisis is going to surpass in next 15 months. 
But upon seeing the crossed news on the partial nationalization, now the security that already is in its limit became a hope justified. 
That is going to be a reason, because the creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking the head on the decision on their isolation of enthusiasm. 
Still the short-term investors can put the final point and to use the transportation to new account of the losses for next benefits compensation taxes payments on the change in the future. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent? -Pit 
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, girl of 16 years, had to be presented in the Highschool of Tachibana the girls began to reírse: The German is completely "kawaii"! 
What does that signify? 
Sylvana knows the word of Sleeves - in a report on the exchanges she counts the Japan. 
"The first day in a school in Japan. 
I felt nervous. 
Already before going to the school was afraid. 
I live to the edge of Tokyo in the direction Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to the Highschool Tachibana. 
Alone it had to find the road, luckily me did not I lose. 
It seems that the beginning of the classes be not set so rigorously as in my house, in Low Saxony. 
Of the eight in the morning the students come, at nine o'clock less twenty begins a small meeting with the professors, the 'home room'. 
Before it began the class, had touched me to present me. 
Besides I am not a person that speaks gladly in the public, above all before a class of 40 students. 
As they still have the school uniform I put me an old skirt of the mother of my host family and besides a blouse, blue socks and black shoes of skin. 
Therefore, thus they dressed I put me to the pulpit and I tried to pronounce all in correct way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana. ..” - I call me Sylvana, I am of Germany and in a week will be my birthday. 
At this time I was very happy because already since two years ago had begun to study this language. 
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and fact signs and all the time I have listened the word "kawaii" 
Already it knew it of my Sleeves. 
That belongs to the Japanese girls survival vocabulary and signifies "monkey, pretty" 
Later I slid quickly in my place. 
The girl to the side had a large smile, for her was a honor that the girl of exchange had to be sat down next to her. 
The remainder of the class was quite tranquil, but when sounded the gong, I felt truly assaulted. 
All they spoke at the same time, itself reían and did a lot questions- at the same time turns out to be very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
Later in the recreation all they removed their Bentos. 
The mother of my host family also did a Lanchbox for my - is something another that bored pieces of German bread. 
Had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and something as meat in mass of tofu. 
In majority of the cases do not I have neither idea of what as here in Japan. 
The things are rare and they have a new flavor. 
What is insurance is that all is very rich. 
Therefore, perhaps with exception of plums marinated in the salt, bufff! 
In the Japanese schools the bentos are not simply a lunch. 
At times passes that a girl prepares a bento done in very artistic way for a boy and him he is given in hope to be able to know it better during a recreation. 
On that I read in my Sleeve-Comics. 
I consider a lot of curiosity to see if I can see it also here. 
"¿Why exactly Japan?", my friends they have asked me when I told that wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year the school. 
Then always responded: 
"Good, because it fascinates me. " 
Finally since years ago I prefer to read Sleeves. 
To be able to understand better the comics and the culture, a day I began to study a little Japanese. 
For me was absolutely sure that a day I am going to travel there. 
Also because I consider a thin tradition and customs. 
Here they have a great value. 
Of a part the Japan is a country of the last technologies and of tendencies, of another part is a severe country, disciplined and traditional. 
As all is well organized, did not yet I feel loss here although Tokyo is the largest city than I have seen some time in my life." 
Also the rats have feelings 
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, ¿why also there is fear? 
Joseph Him Doux, the scientist in the environment of the neurology is convinced that many animals have also feelings. 
How can it be controlled if they, being behaved in the similar way to us, they feel the same thing? 
In a magazine of called internet "Edge" since many years the contributions of famous scientists are published. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question ¿What do you think what is true without being able to test it? 
I believe that the animals have sensations and other states of conscience without I or someone another could test it up to now, although not even we can test that other people have conscience. 
But in this case at least we can expect it because all the human brains present the same fundamental configuration. 
But as quick as we dedicate us to other species and we include the questions on the sensation and in general on the conscience, we enter the unknown environment because the hardware does not coincide. 
When a rat is found in the danger, does the same thing as the other animals: is done the dead person, flees or attacks. 
The people behave in similar way, of what some scientists conclusions ago on comparable subjective experience. 
Naturally it do not I believe. 
Two aspects of the cerebral structure do difficult to infect our subjective experience to that of the animals. 
First, almost always they include the associated circuits by the human conscience of the lobe prefrontal lateral of the cerebral cortex (on account of their participation in the memory cuts and in the executive functions that direct conduct). 
This extensive part is a lot more developed in the case of people that that of the other primates and seems that lacks absolutely in other creatures. 
Keeping in mind at least the above-mentioned aspects to our conscience that depends on the lobe prefrontal of the cerebral cortex, among them know-how on who we are and the ability of planning and to decide, there is a reason to suppose that even the man differentiates himself of the other primates. 
An another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of the man: As the majority of its experience is united with the tongue, often that signifies that the conscience depends on her. 
In this case can be excluded to the animals. 
But even when the conscience would not depend on the tongue, would influence it so that the conscience of the animals, created however, in many cases would be differentiated of the majority of our states of conscience. 
Therefore it turns out to be difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals functions. 
If that, as somewhat interesting and subjective, neither it is left to measure because has the special hardware, neither is left to analyze by means of our experiences, thus its investigation presents us large problems. 
The majority of my interventions refers to the content of the experience consents, but at the same time there is also an another aspect of the conscience that would have that to be easier for the scientific investigations. 
It would be able to investigate the processes of conscience of the animals without keep in mind its contents, and that is what passes during the studies by memory cuts of primates, above all in the example of the viewing. 
But with this focus that continued Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential thing passes more well to the correlatos neutral of the conscience that to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not. 
Curiously this focus puts of relief the importance of the lobe prefrontal of the cerebral cortex for the formation of the viewing. 
And what results of that for the sensations? 
I due to the fact that in the emotional system itself active a part of the brain that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with the fear. 
What we describe as fear is consequently a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the system of defense (or its consequences like for example the reactions of the body). 
It seen of this point of view the sensations are very set to part of the cerebral cortex what distinguishes to primates and above all to the man. 
Of point of view of the linguistic nature they continue classifications of the fine sensation because we can differentiate and to classify the states with aid of the words and of the grammar to be able to describe the states from other to pair of ourselves. 
For example Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derive from the simple activities of the parts of the responsible cerebral cortex by the corporal feelings and of the trunk of encéfalo, the same thing thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more in the trunk encéfalo. 
As this network has not changed a lot during the human evolution, can refer absolutely to different types and its sensations. 
By theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it not probable. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that sits down in two cases also thus: But how can it be controlled if rats and similar men being behaved of way feel the same thing? 
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, ¿therefore because is afraid? 
MYSELF am of opinion that the resemblance of the behavior does not yet test the resemblance of experience. 
That is certain that the comparison neuronal helps: rats and men have trunks of encéfalo similar, the cockroaches on the contrary they do not have at least a brain. 
Is the trunk of the encéfalo the one that is responsible for sensations? 
Even when it be possible to test it for the men: How can it be tested it in case of rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also the cockroaches (¿who knows it?), have sensations. 
But it do not I know how can test it. 
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats that emotional sensations because its sensations supposedly are distinguished fundamentally of us (because the human conscience refers to special circuits and to the tongue). 
In every case here the progresses in the environment of neurology are expected while the same thing of rats be measured and of men. 
As I do not investigate the tongue and the conscience of rats, as well as sensations, do not I know it if they exist. 
It can be told that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to advance that to work permanent without results. 
Therefore well, I am emocionalista practical. 
The president of the UEFA Platini: grace period for the Poland and the Ucraina 
Iwan Wasjunik, the substitute prime minister said that the quick preparations would carry out under the direct responsibility of the president and of the prime minister. 
"The government looks the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as the test of confidence of the capacity of the Ukraine to organize the championship of Europe along with the Poland", said Wasjunik. 
"But that is not an amnesty for our country. 
Now the work is on the verge of beginning and in the two countries there is a lot that to do." 
The schedule of the construction and the reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame. 
Possibly the number of the stadiums goes to to be reduced from eight to six. 
"We cannot lose more time. 
Now we have to carry out works with great velocity", the president of an association said Ukraine Grigorij Surkis. 
"The UEFA is not going to remove the eyes of us." 
In Poland was agreed a more radical step. 
After numerous scandals the Olympic Committee of Poland suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced for the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission met at the request of the minister of sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of continuing the rules", said Drzewiecki to the agency of Polish news PAP. 
"In a letter we have assured the president of the UEFA Platini that the preparation to the championship of Europe of 2012 is not going to suffer of that." 
Alone in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned on account of handling in descent to the lower category, finally also the counsel of division had to be deferred. 
Counterattack of Dennis Quaid indignant 
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview on the private life- and has problems with its former-husband: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan appointed its former-husband as an adulterer. 
Gets mad and counterattacks. 
The backward war of the two roses in the former-couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two actors of Hollywood show publicly an unpleasant fight among them. 
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan was pronounced for the first time on the reasons of the failure of marriage: "Dennis was a lot of unfaithful time to me, and that was very painful." 
She knew the size about its alone infidelity after divorce. 
The motive of the revelation of the private things was the work of Ryan with the press by its new movie "The Women" - is counted a history of the failure of a marriage. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard-of that Meg as many times account the history of our relation in an another version", the man from 54 years said to "New York Daily News". 
Among others things is very "lamentable" that Jack, its son of 16 years, again "is going to recall in public the pain and the changes, everything that signifies a divorce for a boy." 
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is again married and does little time is Pope of twins. 
And thus to it puts an end to its statements putting of relief: "Be that as it may my life continues. 
I feel happy because I have a marvelous family that is well." 
The prices of the plane tickets and of hotels are descending 
In the first half of the year 2008 the plane tickets and the overnight stays in Europe were cheaper comparing the of last year. 
According to a current study, the plane tickets in Germany were done inexpensively even until 50 percent. 
The plane tickets and the overnight stays in hotels were done again cheap - this are results of a study of the supplier of the services of trip and of the financial products of American Express. 
The business has analyzed its data of reservation of the first half of the year 2008 and after the increase of the prices in the first quarter ascertained a large change in the second semester. 
After for many years the prices in the market of hotels continued enlarging, the overnight stays in many places were done inexpensively. 
In comparison with last year, between January and March the prices in 41 of the 48 different cities from Europe enlarged on the average to 6.9 for hundreds. 
Of April to June the prices already descended to 3.6 percent comparing last year. 
The tendencies were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where the travelers had to pay less than the previous year. 
According to American Express, the reason of that was the course of dollar weakened, what was the cause that "the interests of the American tourists in travelling diminished." 
The decrease of the prices of the hotels also causes notes a lot more in the financial centers as Francfort or London that in the points of industrial concentration like Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the city Norway the prices of hotels enlarged to 26.3 percent and thus they beat a record in Europe. 
In the first quarter the prices of plane tickets also showed the upward trends: 
On account of the increase of the prices of kerosene the travelers of the class Economy had to pay for medium term 7.1 percent more than in the year 2007, the flights of long distance even were done more expensive to the 29.2 percent. 
Of April to June the prices of the plane tickets in the class Economy, in comparison with the previous quarter, they descended on the average to 12.5 percent, but the changes of the prices for the Businessclass and the Firstclass were small. 
In Germany the change of the prices was more notable than in other European countries: 
Of January to February the prices enlarged to 11.9, in the second semester they descended to 23.6 percent. 
According to a study, the prices for the national flights in Germany even reduced halfway. 
The cause of the change of the prices is of a part the increase of the limp economy, explains the business. 
In many parts of the market of the trips with the airplane the demand is descending. 
Of another part there is large competence by the tried Bid FOR-Skies that liberalizes the traffic of airplanes between the United States and the Europe. 
The sign of the tense situation is the not lucrative distances flights annulment in air companies, as well as a great number of air companies that in the first half of the year 2008 declared in bankruptcy - alone in Europe were 24 air companies. 
The HSV desire against Gladbach 1:0 
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader. 
Luhukay of Borussia to him does not yet leave to do the eleventh goal. 
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the compulsory landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin. 
The player of Gladbach began to play late and he failed doing a goal. 
Everything that meant exactly reacting to it happened, could read itself it clearly of its lips. 
Alone it knew that was right. 
"We need a second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger in the entrance of cabin of the stadium of Hamburg. 
Step special nothing in the catacombs, the time of rest finished and the majority of the presents was again in its places. 
Rieger was almost during three decades physical therapist of the HSV, enjoys very large reputation as one of those that formed a part of the group. 
Therefore its petition was noted of a responsible person. 
Cornelius Huddle the assistant coach assented with the head and he raised the fingers in sign of assent. 
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Huddle, the main coach of Hamburg. 
Its order was the same one: Go, the second goal! 
But that it was not carried out. 
"Today not all was pleasant to see", added later Marcell Jansen. 
Also Bastian Reinhard had desired to have it "more relaxed". 
The result 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburg has to thank to Mladen Petric (11) with its impact of head; and also to the situation that the team of Gladbach very weak could not show all its force to the weak team of Hamburg. 
"That was a dirty victory", said summarizing Martin Huddle. 
This Monday the SV of Hamburg is going to comply its 121 years. 
On Saturday of will be the spectators already had celebrated their same, the blue sky on the stadium and the change of board in the screen of video. 
Is going to be a birthday without a true festival. 
"We know to interpret it", said Marcell Jansen. 
It foresees that the partial qualifications of the board correspond more to the fickleness of the league that to the dominance of their HSV. 
The quipu with its late players obliged as the Brazilians Snow and Forest, the high-scoring one Petric as well as Jansen that was removed of FC Bayern need time to be joined, but still the quipu cannot shine with its successes. 
"We need more than the feeling and of the dribbling", requires Huddle.

Dark matter influences the path of the spatial probes 
Since many years ago a phenomenon mysteries causes the confusion to the investigators: the Dark Matter influences the velocity of the spatial probes during thus call gravitational assistance to the maneuver. 
The experts are afraid that the Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein cannot be so correct. 
The spatial probe "Ulysses" passed almost 18 years flying in the universe. 
On account that the tubings of fuel are being chilled now a death in the cold threatens him. 
Since years ago a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes the confusion among the investigators. 
The gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the path of the spatial probes during that obtain an acceleration utilizing the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Land. 
That permits the spatial probes to save fuel. 
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spatial probe used this physical trick as well as the probe of the Sun did it Ulysses. 
But what surprise to the investigators for many years: The missiles do not behave for 100 percent as well as expects itself it according to the venerable law of the gravitation. 
More well frecuentan irregularities of the velocity. 
Of unforeseen the probes has greater or smaller velocity. 
The physicists could not explain this effect up to now. 
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver. 
Some experts are afraid that possibly even the general Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein that describes the force of attraction of the matter by the curvature of the space cannot be so correct. 
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes solemnly now as before that Einstein did not he confuse and he tries to explain the anomaly during the gravitational assistance with aid of thus call Dark Matter, in which they remained the astronomers in the universe. 
"The reason of the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to the Land", writes he. 
The investigators of the universe know the existence of the alone Dark Matter since ten years. 
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and his influence he can be been observed in other planets. 
The Dark Matter, to the contrary, is completely invisible what signifies that does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, above all also any visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists the Dark Matter does at least a fifth one of the total mass of the universe. 
The kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free 
As it confirmed the minister of exterior matters of Italy, after passing ten days in the hands of abductors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be liberated. 
The abductors of the Sudan had required millions of the rescue. 
Six abductors should be killed in a cross-fire during the liberation. 
Five Germans are kidnapped in the south of Egypt. 
The negotiations with respect to the rescue already began. 
The Germans fall always again in the point of attention of the abductors. 
The periodic one WELT ONLINE relates on the most important cases. 
By it it seen the kidnapped European tourists in the Sahara are liberated. 
On that the same information presents the state Egyptian television, the radio station of the Arabian television Al-Arabija and the Italian mass media. 
After the news on the liberation in the Italian radio station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian minister of exterior matters, confirmed the liberation: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are liberated. 
'Now we control its state of health ", said Frattini. 
Five Germans, five Italians and a Rumanian as well as its eight Egyptian companions are well and they are found in the security, reports the state Egyptian television. 
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the road to Cairo. 
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons of a cross-fire before the liberation of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the abductors were ready to put an end to the abduction, but the army of the Sudan suddenly had killed six abductors. 
"The problem was solved. 
They were according to the rescue", the guard said. 
It treated alone of "to receive the hostages" when suddenly arrived "this surprise". 
Sunday the Sudanese soldiers have killed six abductors and to two of them there they are person under arrest in the border zone among the Sudan, the Chad and the Egypt. 
The abductors have required from Germany the rescue in the amount of six million euro; the money had to deliver the German wife of an of the hostages. 
The newspaper "The Masri The Jom", being referred a German mediator, reported that the liberation was delayed because the abductors were afraid their security. 
According to the report the abductors intend to free the women's hostages after to have received the rescue. 
The men had to be remained persons under arrest until the abductors had a sure route to flee. 
The embassy of Germany in Cairo rejected to take the position with respect to this report. 
Abuse of stepfather "carried to the suicide" 
According to the court, years of abuse by its stepfather carried a woman to kill itself. 
Michael Trerise, 57 years, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been condemned to five years of jail after admitted eight charges of indecent robberies. 
The Real Court of Truro, through an investigatory study, knew that he regularly had tied her daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl had between five and seven years. 
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: "I feel responsible for its death." 
The court knew that the Mrs Randle killed itself in its house of Mutley in Plymouth, April 1, 2007, at age 34. 
In the season in which the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise was accustomed to tie it and to bandage him the eyes before carry out its sexual acts, while its mother was working in a pub. 
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall. 
Its stepdaughter was transferred to Plymouth. 
Nevertheless, the court knew that the Mrs Randle, that employed great part of its time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that him had been inflicted two times for week. 
In 2006, the fiscal one Ramsey Quaife referred to the cut what some friends of the Mrs Rande had said of her, that after having been a great surfer and cycle, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if there was "renounced the life." 
In April 2007 its true father, Terrace Randle, found the dead woman in its apartment of Plymouth. 
It is supposed that the Mrs Rande have killed itself being suffocated by means of a plastic bag. 
The Mr Randle faced the stepfather of its daughter, that wrote a letter of confession that is concluded saying: "I was used to tying it and ventarle the eyes. 
Never was a sexual robbery. 
I feel responsible for its death." 
The judge Christopher Elwen answered to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and by its victim should have been a frightening experience, especially when had only seven years. 
This unpleasant saga finishes with the victim being removed its own life. 
Still more clear, it is that if she not it to have done, probably the question would not have finished in the courts." 
And it added: "I have noted the effect that according to the description done by the father and the mother of Stephanie the abuse there were on its daughter along the years. 
Clearly she could have had a promising future, of success and happy." 
A loaded official by the loss of data 
The BBC was reported that an official of the Cabinet that forgot some secret documents in the train in June goes to to be accused by virtue of the Law on the official secrets. 
The man, in trip of work by the Department of Defense, abandoned two documents highly classified in the train for Waterloo. 
The documents were past to the BBC before being delivered the police. 
Surely it is a matter of the charge less serious by virtue of the law and does not suppose some indication of the intention to break the law. 
The correspondent of the BBC for the Defense Frank Gardner referred that the prison sentence had arrived like a surprise for many in the English administration. 
"They thought that was a matter of an internal matter between the Department of Defense and the Cabinet," said. 
The employee, that cannot be named, is loaded under the section 8,1 of the Law, the clause that refers to the safeguard of the information. 
The Service Juríco Real indicated that the official should be accused by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive company of his work in the Committee of Secret Services. 
The documents forgot contained secret informations on Al-qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq. 
The official was reported of the decision Monday morning and immediately transferred since his house to a secret place. 
The companies of construction face the price of B&B 
In Great Britain the companies of construction would be able to be faced to a price of more than 80 thousand pounds sterling after the rescue/rescue of the bank Bradford and Bingley. 
The Government, in fact, provided 14 trillion of pounds sterling to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million investors of the bank. 
The interest on the loan will be paid by all the businesses that utilize the money of the the investors, included the 59 companies of construction. 
The general director of the Association of the Companies of Construction (BSA), Adrian Cabbages, considers "humiliating" that the companies and their members have that to pay 
Eventually, the loan de14 trillions should be refunded after the mortgages of Bradford and Bingley are redeemed. 
Nevertheless, the interests that occur in the ínterin, they are supposed loaded each year at 700 o'clock financial businesses that have deposits. 
The Plan of Compensation of the financial Products confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies of construction result included in that number. 
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudence... be calls to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent. 
Adrian Cabbages, BSA 
That is to say that each one of the businesses had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the companies of mediation had to pay approximately the 18% of the cost. 
The Treasure estimates that the interest on the loan will elevate to 450 thousand pounds sterling in 2009. 
This behaves that the companies will have to recover 81 thousand pounds sterling to face the first year of interest. 
Adrian Cabbages, general director of the trade Association of the Companies of Construction, declared to the BBC that this situation is unjust. 
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudence in the growth of the real estate market be calls to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent." 
According to the BSA, there is not data that indicate the failure of some company since 1945. 
"We will have the need to examine all the aspects of this matter in the next weeks to ascertain what options exist for protect the companies of construction and to his members in set against what could be a prominent price," added the Mister Strain. 
The interest yielded in 2009 covers seven months from the the end of September of this year to it of March. 
In 2010, will be a matter of a complete year of exactable interests, that will be able to be almost two times more. 
Being the companies of mutual construction organizations and there not being shareholders, their members will finish inevitably paying the price, be to greater bias rates or lower interests in its savings.

It denied the release on bail to the former prime Minister of Bangladesh 
A court of Bangladesh has rejected the request of release on bail for the former prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be conducted to the jail when he returned to his country. 
Its defenders said that the court did not grant the release on bail accusing of extortion of 50 million taka ($ 729,700) to a businessman when was a prime Minister. 
This is one of the several accusations of corruption to its charge. 
Its rival politics of long tempo, Khaleda Zia, was put in release on bail at the beginning of this month. 
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next weeks, but its party, the League Awami, has required that the government of the country, suportado militarily, first full liberty grant him. 
The correspondents say that while him was given the probation to go the foreigner and to receive some medical processing, is not clear now which are the terms of their liberation or if she will be capable of remain at liberty when he will return to Bangladesh. 
Its lawyers say that they will do an appeal before the Supreme Court against the order of the Upper Court. 
"The Supreme Court rejected the petition of release on bail for Sheikh Hasina maintaining that could not obtain the release on bail reason already was in abroad low processing probation," its lawyer said Rafique-ul Huq. 
"We are going to interpose a resource of appeal against the order of the Supreme Court." 
Its defenders argued that she needed the release on bail to return to her country since the foreigner and to be prepared for the elections of December. 
Sheikh Hasina should return to its country after October 17, according to what referred a leader of the League Awami the past Sunday. 
She was person under arrest last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, assumed the power, but was put at liberty in June to go the foreigner and to receive some medical processing. 
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges that are defendants. 
Fears for the campaign the against the poliomyelitis in Afghanistan 
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan – the UN says - there they are not podium to take advantage of a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign on account of the violence of the Talibans. 
Last week the United Nations have carried out a program of vaccination in six provinces of the country. 
The organization reports that could not arrive the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South by reasons of security.

New investigation in the assumption of the American lawyers 
The General Proxy of the United States has named a special proxy to investigate the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006. 
The reason was a report in which the general inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the action on the part of the officials of the administration. 
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former one Produrador General Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons. 
The Special Proxy Nora Dannehy is investigating if the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied the investigators in the intent to hinder the justice. 
"Serious accusations of possible criminal conducts fully have not been investigated or resolved," the General Proxy Glenn Beautiful affirms in the report. 
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special proxy with the power to oblige the witnesses to leave its statements. 
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were removed from their charges by the Department of Justice in December of 2006. 
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that the lawyers said good-bye for low performance. 
But later it was known that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other their colleagues, and many observers carried to the conclusion that say good-bye they would be motivated them by political reasons. 
Some of the lawyers in question they had worked in the pursuit of some Republicans, members of highly profile of the Congress, while other they had refused to investigate the accusations of electoral fraud against the Democrats. 
These lawyers investigate and they indict the judicial cases for the government 
And they say good-bye at any moment, but done not remove by political reasons. 
The successive head of the department of Justice, the General Proxy Alberto Gonzales, low pressure by the dismissals, renounced its position. 
A certain number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same thing. 
The report of the General Proxy is very critic of the role played by the Mr Gonzales in the matter, and he underlines as he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, that "he abdicated" of his position of leadership and he was "notably not collaborative" in the process. 
Other officials, and among them Karl Rove, the former collaborator of Bush, they were criticized by not to have cooperated with the investigation. 
The epic poetry of Meat Loaf of a lot of honor 
The star of rock Meat Loaf goes to to be honored in the Q Awards by its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, that will collect the special prize the next week in the ceremony that will take place in London, said that to obtain this recognition will be "a honor". 
The song, that hard nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf succeeded in 1977. 
The group of Coldplay they are carrying the candidacies for the prizes of this year and doing the classification of the four categories. 
Paul Rees, writer-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them. " 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity as the one that was utilized by Meat Loaf. 
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn. 
The song was known first like a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and came be number 15 in the classification. 
Nevertheless, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained some nine years in the classifications and came sell more than 40 million copies everywhere. 
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Reads Aday - has suffered problems of health in recent years, including a surgical operation by its heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, a sharp laryngitis obliged him to cancel some concerts. 
Subsequently arose that had a cyst in its vocal cord. 
Dark street of the city, often forgot and perhaps soon for sale 
The city of new York counts on thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, other simply of service. 
Nevertheless, to many people, inclusas the veteran cabdrivers and the local residents of long dates, turns out to be difficult them to indicate the location of the Extra Tackle, above all because many of them never have heard to speak of this street. 
The small street is found in the East Village and extends to the North of the Primiera Silence – before that I found the Seconda Street - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue. 
This callecita, more or less than 30 feet of wide and 120 of long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active way. 
There is not signs. 
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas. 
The street, nevertheless, has admirers. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the business that recently has built buildings of luxury in the Primiera Silence 
That wants repavimentar Extra Tackle and to create a clean walkway to the stores and boutiques that expects to open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include the neighbors of old woman dates that they commented to be delighted by the rail truncated simply because is one of the last remainders of the past of the block before the appropriation of the buildings. 
Nevertheless, the Department of the Dwelling, Preservation and Development of the city, that has the control of the street, has no interest in possessing it. 
In the meeting of the Committee of Community of Vencidad for the use of the land that took place this month, the representatives of the agency Avalon outlined a proposal to buy the street. 
Nevertheless, the committee, preferring that the street to remain to the city, asked a new plan that the next month will be presented, as said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community n. 3. 
"The city is an owner today of very few spaces and we he would like that to continue possessing Extra Tackle," said the Mrs. 
"We can consider the done proposals by Avalon to solve the problem and to negotiate the space, but also we want to guarantee the public access to the street." 
Avalon Bay had announced does various months that wanted to repair the small street and to install some seats, included some for to be utilized as coffee, in the wait to rent the spaces. 
The idea that Avalon would be able to buy the street arose for the first time during the meeting of this month 
But Michele of Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that in spite of the fact that the company wanted to utilize the street, did not necessarily want to possess it. 
"The primary worry of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this alley abandoned and the public possibility to become an area," said, adding that the proposal of sale came from the same city. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Committee for the Preservation, confirmed that was a desire of the city it to sell the street and observed that the mission of the agency is the development of the property more than the management of that. 
In comparison with its outskirts more than color, the of the Bowery, Extra Tackle has left a track in the history. 
Some they believe that obtained its name in 1802, when the great farm of property of Philip Minthorne was divided between its children and this narrow stripe of land was demanded by nobody. 
The rear door of the CBGB, the monument of rock punk rocker that closed in 2006, itself abriba in Extra Tackle, but the street is perhaps better known by the photography of the establishment that leaves in the covered with the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia". 
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, that the picture in November of 1976 took. 
"Was full of trash, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, placards, leaves, cords." 
Some residents, included the bloggers that write on the gentrification of the East Village, they have opposed to the idea to sell Extra Tackle, arguing that the still modest, public goods that be, they should continue being public. 
Other they have praised Extra Tackle as rare piece, practically without changes, a slice of the city that should be protected. 
Jeremías Moss, that directs a called blog Jeremiah' s Vanishing New York (I subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: To Bitterly Nostalgic Look at to City in the Process of Going Extinct"), he has placed available part of a chat of the history of the city on Extra Tackle, published by the daily one The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Tackle is an alley a little strait and no way out, dark also by the day and marked by iron store doors oxidized and against-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the cannelloni." 
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or except the same one in a recent afternoon. 
A rat itself curía through the part behind of the street and stopped fence the door that was utilized to enter to the CBGB and that now receives a luxury clothes store. 
Graffiti in the walls and a bottle of empty beer closely 22-oz were near of a new lot of newspapers rejected. 
Some assistants said that seldom they put attention in Extra Tackle, but they suggested that would be able to give him a cleaned. 
The Mr Fields, in turn, noted that some people underestimates the attractive power of the street in its current state. 
"I passed the better years of my life," said, "in filthy, humid, and dark places." 
The debate on the bilingualism: immersion in the English language 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Throw T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates on the bilingual education. 
Throw T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on the California and director of studies of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not ace Good ace You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice." 
Calling in an effective way the Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals in matter of done education by Barack Obama are the example of that. 
The campaign of the Mr. Obama takes note that "the Afro-Americans and the latin American students have significantly less odds to be graduated that the white students," and this is a very certain consideration. 
To fight such differences in the events of the learning, the plan of education of Obama specifically fights, among others things, "the bilingual education of transition" for the students-English. 
Nevertheless, the open question for the Mr Obama is if the commitment of the bilingual education, that prefers in classroom the instruction in different languages from the English, be efficient in annulling the distance in the final results. 
We take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognized in the oriental region of the county of Los Angeles. 
In this school the vast majority of the students they are Hispanic and of family with low income: 
More than one third of the students, many of which recently arrived, they are learning the English language. 
Nevertheless, an incredible one 100 percent of the students of the fourth year, has been evaluated positively in the exam of math of 2008 
And almost a likewise amazing one 93 percent has dominated the test of English language and arts. 
This incredible success has managed to utilizing a different ingredient that it favorido by the Mr. Obama. 
The school Sixth Street emphasizes the review and the practice, the constant evaluation of the competences and does not tolerate some attitude of excuses. 
Besides, and here it is where the Mr Obama should take note, according to Pretty Mikels, the main one of the Sixth Street, the focus of the school for the instruction of English to the students is in the "total immersion". 
Immersion in English signifies the almost exclusive utilization of the language in the processing of the contents of the instruction. 
The Mrs Mikels, that is opposed to the bilingual education, told me, "we been successful extraordinary with students as this last that from Mexico has arrived and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later would not be capable of collecting what was." 
"It functions," indicated, "we believe that function." 
It will take the Mr Obama a school as Sixth Street Prep like a model to retort for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt on the answer, but the idea of the the politicians of their party on the matter of the education (the Associations for the National Education have been for long time defenders of the bilingual education) and their same constant support to the dark bilingual education the prediction of the answer of the Mr Obama. 
Though it is that the immigrants should learn English, recently the Mr Obama has trivialized the question leaving that the people to should stop worrying for the legislation that only is written in English 
And instead of that, it said, "you should be assured that its boy CAN speak Spanish." 
If really the Mr. Obama desires to improve the system and to close gaps, should consider carefully the models of education that work well, more than despising them or to trivialize them. 
The price of the petroleum falls unceremoniously after them renewed economic fears 
The price of the petroleum was reduced drastically this Monday on account of the worry that the American plan of rescue for the financial markets cannot be capable of reviving the economy. 
The actions of the crude oil diminished 7 percent arriving at 99.80 dollars the barrel in the negotiation in the morning in the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The price has descended of more than 20 dollars by barrel since the past Monday. 
In the last two weeks, the commodities markets have been shaken for the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching a maximum of 145.29 dollars by barrel in July, the prices had fallen to almost 90 dollars by barrel at the beginning of this month, before going back, once more, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets. 
The anxiety seized the investors, once more, Monday, in spite of the leaders of the Congress that said they had arrived at an agreement during the weekend on the plan of rescue, the largest one in the history. 
The news was seen darkened by new worries that the financial crisis would be far from finishing. 
The evolution that was produced in the last episode of the process of fusion, confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said this Monday. 
In the meantime, the Dutch, Belgian governments and of Luxembourg partly they have nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis. 
The analysts in Barclays Capital said that, in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that conducted to the agreement of rescue "seem not to have been able to revive the feeling of the market." 
As the economic situation deteriorates, expects in a cut of the demand of basic products, included the petroleum. 
"The perspectives for the world equity, the interest rate and of change they are going to be increasingly more uncertain," they wrote the analysts of the Deutsche Bank in a note to the investors. 
"We believe that the basic products will not be able to escape from this contagion. 
Since the perspective of the products, ours more pressing worry is the evaluation if the American virus will spread on a worldwide basis and specifically to China. " 
The analysts of the bank have reduced its expectations for the next year, like the consumption of low petroleum on account of the crisis in the economic growth and the forecast of reduction of the price of the petroleum and of the gas is of 20 percent for 2009. 
Fourth second of insanity: team establishes record 
After they to have passed, during the last eight seasons, more time than nobody in the uniform of Jets, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis I thought that had seen all. 
Then he saw as they develop the things in the fourth second this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a party without annotation in a play to be deflated. 
"Never I have seen nothing as that," commented Ellis. 
The fourth second initiated after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness under the somber of the clouds. 
At this time occurred that the quarterback Brett Favre found to Laveranues Cabbages carrying out a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relation among the players had a great leap forward. 
Favre found to Cabbages for two goals more in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the half. 
"I did not leave the road," said Favre of all the steps that went to Cabbages. 
"He is a devil of a player. 
Our communication has been large, independently of what the people can think." 
While Favre and Cabbages were performed in the prey, the defense of the Cardinals mistreated to the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith puntó to another pair and intercepted it. 
Linebacker David Bowens was obliged the lack by Warner. 
In the last one turnover, the lacks obliged by Bowens, they would be able to have been the best. 
The Cardenals had taken the possession with 10 available seconds, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a kick of 20 yards to win a final one 34-0. 
They are the greater points that the Jets never did in a room. 
To The coach of the team, Eric Mangini, you ask him to describe the insanity of this moment, said: "The fourth second or the third room? " 
When him it was answered both - the Jets permitted 21 points without answer in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that i liked a lot more the fourth second that the terzero. 
They have earned a pile of points in a very short period of time." 
Gebrselassie rested heads its world record 
Once more, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown because many consider him the largest runner of the history, surpassing its own world record in the marathon of Berlin this Sunday and occurring the first capable person of running the career of 26,2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in the accommodating career in plain in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds its previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin. 
At age 35, Gebrselassie has established the record world number 26 in a career of an impressive length so has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, since the time trial until to the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part to the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps of too alarming way, with hindsight - that the contamination of the air they aggravated their problems with the asthma. 
On the other hand, was aimed to run in Berlin. 
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees upon beginning the career, 55 degrees in the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing in medium term some cutting 4 minutes 43 seconds by mile. 
Since when runners of trail as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya they have been converted to long distances, the record of the marathon has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo gives Coast of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998. 
After the victory of the past Sunday, Gebrselassie told the journalists that had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks before and that had lost a week of training. 
It is evident that the suspension left him fresh, done not oxidize. 
"I am very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists. 
"All was perfect. 
I began again a week ago, and today I stained some doubts, but in the end all was well." 
The athlete has been object of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the rival Afro-oriental of Ethiopia - for the style to orchestrate too much its careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, basing on the pacemaker as if was a matter of a racetrack, and putting the record by in front of the sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the abilities of Gebrselassie as the runner. 
This Sunday, to the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the half of the career in 1:02:04. 
Two runners of elite of Kenya, James Kwambai and Chat Kamathi, they began to challenge to Gebrselassie after their pacemaker they diminished. 
But little before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie caught a last impulse to be separated of Kwambai, who finalized second in 2:05:36, improving its better personal record by almost five minutes. 
Kamathi arrived at the third place in 2:07:48. 
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a notable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh faster time in the history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain possesses the world record of 2:15:25. 
It they passed spring, Mikitenko, of 36 years, was a surprise and won the Marathon of London in 2:24:14. 
She did neither take part in the Play of Beijing for which was described as a wound in the back, but recovered to win in Berlin and to establish its personnel better record in almost five minutes in the third marathon that ran. 
It did a career of intelligent calculation, leaving a quartet of running Kenyans and Ethiopians to do of head and, subsequently, recovering them after 18 ½ miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second plaza in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finalized of third in 2:25:01. 
In a city aside, the pride and the tests of the life of color 
It hidden by the expansion of the park to theme of the large one Edging, few kilometers of the brilliant, noisy and colossal city, a tranquil town is found, where the pride and the complications of the Afro-American experience remain very evident. 
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by black incorporated in the country and place of the infancy of Zora Neale Hurston, no longer is as simple as she described it in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and neither a jail." 
Now is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual one Zora! It trades in Eatonville to pay homage to the Mrs Hurston, the most famous author of the Renaissance of Harlem. 
And, nevertheless, in many senses, the city that she described – also a phase ago tourist by means of its inclusion in the produced by Florida trips guide the Project of the Federal Writers of the season of the depression - continues being a place aside. 
The city remains independent, worthy and private as was it in the years '30, when Mrs Hurston wrote that the black rural in the Florida often resistiva to share its true ideas with the white man, that "little knows so on us and that does not know what goes losing." 
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, the senator Barack Obama, has called the attention to begin an I talk on the matter of the race, many continue being cautious in set against the outsider. 
"We are very cautious about in the way in which our history is counted," Jones said Hortense, 59 years, a resident of all the life and member of the oldest church of the city. 
"Has to be correct." 
Eatonville has always been definite a paradox of triumph and fight. 
Is to the same tempo a historic model of the affirmation of the black and a community of almost 2,400 people that live under a level of double poverty of the national average. 
It is a literary center, but also an example repaired of the black southern rural culture - at times disdained, other praised - that was born of the slavery in America. 
No wonder, if the ones that reside here are at the same time proud and reserved. 
To AND the worry by the image of Eatonville really began for Zora, as here nobody calls him Mrs Hurston. 
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep books in dialect as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide of the Florida transformed the city, barely out of the Route 17, a highway that runs through the center of the Florida often forgot toward inside the history of the black and the human drama. 
Having face of so much cement in the life as much as in the literature, the Mrs Hurston carried its readers to the store of property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and later inside more private areas. 
"Out of the highway on the left-hand side," wrote, "there is the modern public school marón with his finished white, his well maintained jardinos and patios of play, cares by Howard Miller, like he barely can read and to write." 
She also mentions the new husband of the widowed one Dash and he writes that Glenn Reads "sells beverages of all types and any thing goes with transitory rooms." 
Therefore, in only some hundreds of words, the Mrs Hurston puts in relation Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with the illiteracy, the second marriage and the sex. 
Evidently, this Fodor did not do it. 
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait. 
"Zora described it such as was," She said Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that the Mrs Hurston immortalized citing men that went singing colorless songs about its beauty. 
It added: "Some people did not he like that." 
The Mrs Hurston still is recalled here as an eccentric lively one that returned frequently after its family moved to Jacksonville, in Florida. 
Franklin August, 77 years, recalls that when the Mrs Hurston arrived in city, did it without prior notice in a large one Chevrolet, smoking and carrying pants in a city that still today prides itself on dressing with dignity. 
The majority of the residents they remained fascinated, the Mister said Franklin, while many himself reían sarcastically. 
"The people always was happy a lot to see Zora," continues the Mr. Franklin. 
But, it adds, being balanced in its chair in a rear patio with view on the Lake Sabelia, where the Mrs Hurston probably was baptized, "she never remained too much time." 
When the Mrs Hurston died in 1960, was poor and its books no longer were in printing. 
As the majority of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgot of her. 
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color in the Barnard College in the years '20, was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where had been living. 
In Eatonville, did not there were large commemorative, neither large ceremonies public readings. 
"Do not I believe that its contribution to the world or its inheritance they were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of the Mrs Hurston published in 2003. 
A certain turn arrived in the '80. 
The officials of the County of Orange wanted to put a highway of five rails through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the street of two main rails of the labor community. 
The expansion of the area to Edge already had pushed the Interstate one 4 through the western edge of the city. 
The proposal arrived in a moment in which Eatonville was recovering of a difficult period of its history. 
The integration forced, among others things, there was placed term to him relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the '50, the fight by the racial mixture carried the hatred about the community. 
"During that season, a group of white boys, they went for the city throwing oranges and each thing against the people that were seated to the side," the Mister said Franklin. 
"They killed also a girl, once. 
They launched him against a watermelon of the car." 
In a letter from the 1955 to the Mrs Hurston wrote to the daily one The Edging Sentinel, criticizing it forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring to my race." 
R The residents say today that the desegregation of the schools, positive in some aspects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its youths. 
"The black children were usual to be embraced - me agreement of this – was accustomed to embrace the professor in the morning and at night," said N.AND. Nathiri, the daughter of Her Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, an organization without end of gain. 
This lasted, added, until the professors and the students did not stem from the same place. 
"Did not it go embracing your professor because éra white - there is a cultural gap there," he said the Mrs Nathiri. 
The civil law, nevertheless, they helped to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists that passed over the prejudices, just like she did it, with buoyant, confidence and lines as: "¿How is able some to refuse itself the pleasure of my company! 
It do not I understand." 
In 1975, the author Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of the Mrs Hurston and began to fight to resurrect its reputation. 
Five years later, a praised biography of the Mrs Hurston done by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it in the American canons. 
The project of the highway arrived just just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville went again under the reflectors. 
And this time, the old neighbors of the Mrs Hurston saw it as a savior. 
In 1988, the community began to plan a fair for the Mrs Hurston to show what the county would be able to ruin with that highway. 
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many return for the celebration. 
After various years, the county has abandoned its proposal of highway. 
"The idea resurrected of the highway to five ways, would have been to put in which you would call velocity of curvature, a true civic pride," said the Mrs Nathiri. 
The Mrs Boyd told it more simply: "Zora saved to Eatonville." 
The victory on the project of the highway has helped to change the image of the same city. 
Outside people city as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer that began to come to the church from here in 1993, they began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to revise the past. 
Eatonville entered the National Historic Registration in 1998. 
A new library (carrying the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repavimentado and beautified Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays, Eatonville continues being an anomaly in Florida: to only six miles of the center of Edging, is able, at times, to feel you as in a street of the past under a rain of summer, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(The 90 percent of the people is black the day of today.) 
The outsiders that come in search of the history of Eatonville, of their meaning, often they are still dealt with precaution. 
To A permission by anticipated is necessary to do the majority of the interviews, and some things - as the mural in the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men that work in the country - cannot be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like the Mrs Jones, a brave one and convinced teacher that considers weakness the red brilliant one, still is afraid that its community island gives can be misinterpreted. 
And, nevertheless, like the Hurston festival has been expanded, also a greater level of native pride has arisen. 
The youths, particularly, they tend to see Eatonville to the same way that the Mrs Hurston saw all its race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and likewise to the other ethnic and racial groups in America, proud, creative, hard-working, foolish and mixed. 
It is a sincere civic sense what can listen in the voice of the nephew of the Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, of 18 years, that goes planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the Department of Police, that said would be able to need something of aid. 
And even those that are younger, like Lark and Alexia Kenon, two twins of 11 years of Winter Park, they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"The majority of the people, in case that dare to go to here, they will have to think, 'Oh, this city is not swum in comparison with any another'," Lark says Kenon after going to the church in a recent Sunday. 
"But if really you even and you take a moment to look at to its history, is a very pleasant city." 
Around here, in New York, all they speak normally of finances 
In the surface, nothing has changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan were maintained far from the newsstands and of the gigantic television screens in Times Square, they would not realize to be found in the eye of the hurricane. 
They never would be able to imagine that behind the facade of glass from the offices to honeycomb pattern that are found above their heads, the bankers and the agents of speculative funds that monopolize New York are faced daily with the worst one "badly day of the office" since the fall of 1929. 
Boys for the home delivery service continue causing echoing its carts of metal for the tea through the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for meetings breakfast. 
Latin American men continues dragging among buildings of apartments cargodos, just like human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric printing colgandas to a yoke through its shoulders. The workers of office still expect in queue for its food to carry in the morning, and continues being impossible to catch a taxi between the 4 and the 7 in the afternoon in the workdays. 
The employees expect todavia doing queue by its bagel to the carts of the the salespersons, and todavia is impossible to find a taxi between the four and the five in the afternoon in them you gave of the week. 
It seemed me as if did not there was a crisis at all, until, this Thursday in the afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there is, I have determined to open a new savings account. 
Although it had calculated the necessary time so that the operation to coincide with the calm of the end in the afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of more or less 20 people already was expecting. 
And not by in front of the window of the employee, to withdraw their cash or to do a deposit, but across the bank of services to the client, where the clients of all the life order their checkbooks, the tourists seek instructions for go to the large stores of Macy and new clients want to open their accounts. 
The majority of these people they preceded me, I was reported later by Starr, my "personal banker of confidence", and they were in queue for the same reason that I. 
As opposed to me, still, already they had withdrawn their savings of the smallest banks in places since where they had exchanged them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Island of Staten. 
They had removed their money of the thus called associations of savings (a little as a company of construction), of the credit unions and of the savings banks of their hometown whose brancas only they function inside the state of ownership, and that say to treat the clients like to their family. 
During last year, 15 of of these banks silently they have failed. 
In the last days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $ 327 billion assets, entered bankruptcy, and as the new yorkers were directed toward its houses Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some deposits of savings of $ 440 billion, went seeking a buyer of rescue. 
The workers of the offices and stores that remained in front of me, fearing another collapse, they were transferring its money to a bank to what a sure refuge is considered, what is doing the majority of the rescues in Wall Street. 
Ordinary people of new York have been converted in the last few weeks in experts of the finances. 
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by telephone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the unsuccessful bank, and their executive director of sorrowful aspect, Dick Fuld, commented the matter with familiarity as if they complained of the inactivity of a colleague. 
And Lyn, fiftieth and something superintendent in uniform of my block of apartments, has changed the normal course of our conversations on Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the tradesman. 
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in bottoms of the money markets. 
The commutation is done, I am not taking some risk."

A spokesman of the local Islamic Community said that they were "deeply collided" by the news of the desecration, that arrived at the religious Moslems when the month Ramadan went finishing. 
In the meantime, Austria goes preparing to a round of introspection later the turn to the right in the parliamentary elections of yesterday. 
The two parties of far right that were hoarded almost the 30 percent of the votes, the Party of the Liberty and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, they had conducted a campaign encentrada in the vehemence anti-immigration and some of their slogan they were you considered xenófobos by the critics. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Party of the Liberty that won more 18 percent of the voting, did its campaign against the handkerchiefs of head and the burkas, and besides, expressed its opposition to the respected food related to the Islam. 
In its last encounter in Vienna, spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of the Islam. 
Both the parties ententan to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that were symbols of the politics of Islamization under way in Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, that have confirmed the far right as the strongest political block of the country, they indicate that the change was produced chiefly by the young voters that they are worried about their future in the European Union.

"I grasp the teacher out of scene to extract its caracter" Günther Bauer_Photographer 
Neither heels neither flying neither you brought of premiere. 
The essence of the large teachers of the flamenco, despoiled of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or the woman. 
To a side the artist. 
To the other, the person. 
Inseparable save in the intimacy, in those alien moments to the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a look stolen or the expressiveness of some hands, unworried because they are not going to leave to scene. 
The German one Günther Bauer alternate in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some put in scene with singers, dancing and guitarists with that less well-known side of these teachers. 
With this proposal, the photographer collects the private iconography of the flamenco since different environments. 
It included in the programming of the Month of the Flamenco Photography, the exposition "reflects the international importance of the flamenco, greater each day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be people any but, upon seeing the photos, the observer realizes that are not the typical images of artists in the setting. 
This people portrayed "in the street" are capable artists to transmit in scene passion, sadness, happiness... captivating to the public. 
To grasp the personality of these artists not one must take pictures of the setting. 
They carry their personality and character inside. 
What to my interested was me to create an intimate atmosphere that me to permit to grasp with the camera the personality of the large of the flamenco". 
With the flavor of the festival "Sing of the Mines", Bauer began in 1,997 a long trip to portray the flamenco singers, guitarists or flamenco dancers with a camera of plate. 
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and of the material they recall the classical photography. 
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical base of the image, conferring him modernity, idea that reflects how understands the own one Bauer the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises each day". 
It is not the action of the dance, of the sing or of the sound in itself, but the personality of the artist, its character, that captive with its art to the public. 
The search of an encounter with the essential thing, with the elf that is done visible in a form to feel, to be and to be they are and they have been the constant one of this work that is presented these days in the gallery The Fotómata. 
Known figures of the flamenco as Diego The Cigala, Chano Cub, Cristina Pits, Enrique Dwell you, The Lebrijano, Antonio Channels, Vicente Friend, among others, they configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed. 
The project has become an anthology of the flamenco, that quick will be published in a book that will collect the portraits exposed in the sample. 
The passion by the portraits of Bauer carried to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran sportsmen" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "he I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter an instant in his life, he be a long or short instant. 
I believe that inside the photography the portrait is the most difficult kind. 
Find you or confront people, personages, that some times neither know, or that some minutes leave you only to be able to take the photo. 
In spite of these circumstances, like the photographer, always I try to do reality my ideas". 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that carries for title "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery The Fotómata, situated in the number 20 of the street of it Kills, parallel to the Park of Hercules, where will be able to be visited to the next one 16 of October.

'Blood of May', the epic bet of Garci 
Being inspired in the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci amuses the famous lifting of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, the one that is the most ambitious movie in its filmography with near 15 million euro of budget. 
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of personages and the social analysis" that always he has admired in the work of the acquaintance novelist, he has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the front of an extensive team of interpreters. 
Blood of May, with an upper length at two o'clock and average, this Friday in the film rooms premieres itself, to be become the future in a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration. 
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures to have completed with this filming "a dream of infancy", that should thank to Hope Aguirre, who since the Community of Madrid entrusted him three years ago to roll a commemorative tape by the centennial second of May 2 of Madrid, something that accepted whenever the story was based on the National Episodes. 
The 15 million budget that has contributed in its totality the Community of Madrid they constitute for Garci an "unique opportunity" to set with them decorated and the adequate wardrobe the portrait of "a Spain dazed that was mistaken of leader by the one that to fight, since, the fight by the independence carried to the town to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", has aimed. 
But the filmmaker regrets not to have counted with a financing as that of Alatriste or The ghosts of Goya - more than the double one of that of Blood of May-, for which he has not been able to roll some scenes expressed in a hyphen signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career. 
Because of it, the director to begin again, has impacted in which is its habitual form of work, it put in scene with the actors, with the ones that is used to practicing before initiating the filming and to the ones that does not do casting, by seeming him "humiliating" and to consider that "part of the position of the director resides in responding to the theater and to the movies to know what occurs in The one that works". 
Many of the interpreters with the ones that coincides in Blood of May repeat before its camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, of Carlos Larrañaga or of Fernando Guillén Raven. 
Candidate to the Oscar in four occasions - of which won a-, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent to Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the own Blood of May, Seven French pool tables and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, they do not represent to a young generation of the Spanish movies, "that is the one that should bring to light", has assured. 
With this movie Garci does not expect prizes. 
"In the starts you believe that work for the posterity, then realize that only work for the prosperity, and now comply with you to do a movie more", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional path.

The publication of the "Daily of a poet newlywed" closes also the Period of three years 
The presentation of the first edition illustrated of the "Daily of a Poet Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen' s Church (New York), place where Juan Ramón Jiménez contracted marriage with Zenobia in March of 1916, is framed inside the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Meeting of Andalusia to celebrate the "Period of three years Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the purpose to commemorate the fifty anniversary of the concession Nobel prize of Literature and of the death of both.

America less likes itself without Paul Newman 
"At times God creates perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of them". 
The phrase is of the actress Sally Field, that worked with him in "Absence of malice", and gives the idea of the desertion of the American movies, and of every America, before the stunning idea that Newman has gone. 
It looks that cost them to give him an Oscar. 
And that was withdrawn since 2007. 
And that was known that was very sick. 
Even so has been a blow for all. 
"At times what one feels is beyond every expression, and I now have lost a great friend", cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence". 
Nobody was afraid to do the ridiculous one neither to exaggerate. 
It had died a father of the movies and of the country in a particularly dark moment, with fear to the terrorists and to the markets, with the American self-esteem by the floors, seeking desperately motives for the dignity. 
When so hard it is the time and without virtue the men and well few beings that to admire remain you, does not do lack to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
It embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truly. 
It was formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of causes lost and you earned, since the foundation to fight the drugs created in honor of its first-born one died by overdose to its housekeeper food mark and organic. 
All a gift to a country to which him there is side a lot to be recovered to a suicidal eating culture. 
The shock wave of the admiration swept Hollywood without attending to nationalities neither passports. 
The last one James Bond, the English one Daniel Craig, verified that has not died a man but a was. 
Another English, the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that to work with Newman was neither more neither less than the summit of its career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call to Newman its greater inspiration. 
"The very high ribbon has left us to all", verified George Clooney, perhaps one of the few that nowadays dares to try to live like lived Paul Newman: maintaining high the demand of probity and of having a serious private life and far away of the cameras. 
This always is not easy or not even possible in the media jungle of today. 
But there is who tries it, and Paul Newman is its example. 
It was divorced once but then was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to which was faithful when surely the opportunities they exceeded him of be it not. 
"¿But why do I be going to eat hamburger away, if inside I have fillet?", was used to joking he himself. 
In the sky you grasped him the pride that in the land its daughters coincide with their fans, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the large roles that interpreted, of none was as proud as of that of devout husband, father lover, solicitous grandfather and philanthropist dedicated", they say. 
The imperfect career of a Madrid Olympic 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that they be celebrated in Madrid some Olympics and, after the failed one 2012, that be the 2016. 
But I ask me, ¿we are prepared? 
If we continue the example of the career of yesterday, ¡I say that not! 
The perfect career they called it, and to my judgment has been the worst career with a lot in which I have been. 
A peak of nonsense that, of course, if they kept in mind it as evaluation and I examined, would be a very clear suspense. 
But we go for parts and since the principle. 
The nonsense begin with it collected of the number, that causes has to go you before. 
Which does not seem me badly, but if already they cause they go you that they give it all (included the chip to avoid queues in the career). 
Therefore not. 
Here only they caused they went you to collect the number (first nonsense, to go only for that) and (after the pertinent queue), ¡surprise!, only there was size 'S' for the undershirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL) 
In what world we live? 
Or it is that by the crisis they have determined to buy only small undershirts with less fabrics and cheaper? 
Therefore well, things like these are a trifle compared with those of the day of the career. 
Aside from that to have that to go very quick to collect the chip, the queue upon arriving is of 15 minutes and, besides, one must leave the backpack. 
More than 35 minutes the wait lasted, somewhat incomprehensible for a career where expects at more than 11,000 people. 
Then, as it was to expect, began the career and we yet had not left the backpack, although once obtained, it collected was worse. 
Besides, the rain enlivened the wait of more than 40 minutes, that joined with attempts of popular rebellion and robbery to the cottage. 
I believe that some 500 people surely tomorrow we will have pneumonia, and some as I, not even they will appear with the correct time in the classification, due to the chip that gave me that, I imagine, me not the exit marked correctly. 
Of course, if they asked me me to for the perfect career, this would not enter my thoughts. 
So I believe that we will continue dreaming of an Olympic city well prepared. 
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual) 
In the conference of Emerging Technologies of the MIT Microsoft has shown an advance of a new image recognition system and human interaction, a species of Artificial Intelligence without a lot of intelligence but capable to carry out some basic tasks, as to ask a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to be moved for the campus of the company) attending to what listens in the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a forms recognition system and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the room, who are - even to recall what they carry position - and to listen and to understand the keywords of their conversations. 
Also group to the presents according to the groups of conversation. 
In the video of sample the receptionist detects a third person but he understands that he does not belong to the group that is speaking with her and that is not an employee of the company. 
It asks if is there to visit someone and says him that will attend him in brief. 
All without pantallazo blue. 
Impressive. 
But that, clear, is the future. 
Now the business has better things in which to be concentrated, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has been spoken far above a change of strategy in Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the indispensable thing instead of loaded of basurilla commercial, would go five faster times - man, Steve, already will be for less. 
All a find keeping in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of course is thanked. 
Microsfot is right, the operating system goes losing importance, and also the software. 
When Google Chrome left to the network, I was one of the ones that added to the theory that was the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many indicated with success that a browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because is the indispensable layer so that the Hardware and the Software be understood. 
It complies the same function that its woman or its husband when you have that to tell him something to its mother-in-law. 
Is true. 
Never will disappear but one must think in the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth. 
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people each time I lend less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser. 
The computer starts only to execute the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and each day we pass more time sailing that in the environment of windows. 
Why do they serve the half of the applications that come in the system? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, that View. 
Less heavy, less it reloaded, less complex. 
To Microsoft interests more to integrate their services online and that at last they be an alternative to Google. 
They need it desperately, in fact, and I bring a small example. 
The photo of this post I took it in one of the rooms of rest for employees of Microsoft, in Redmond, at the beginning of month. 
In the machine of refreshments a placard asks them that they use their tool of search - "Your search. Ours future". 
In the year 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of the employees of Microsoft utilized Google to seek in the network. 
Last week, certainly, a delay in the new version of Windows was confirmed also Mobile 7. 
It will not arrive at principles of 2009 but to ends, more well throwing to 2010. 
In Microsoft surely they will seek the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, is each day more computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already in the street, is going to pass bill. 
Him Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso carried it in the Blue Coast, Leonardo I gave Caprio lit up an in 'Diamond of blood' of Edward Zwick, the same thing that To The Pacino in 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola and form splits of the uniform of the parish gay musculada.

The recidivist conductors by blood alcohol should install the 'alcolock' 
Interior wants that the conductor with three administrative sanctions by blood alcohol, have that to install in its vehicle a system that impedes to start the drunken vehicle, or if itself does not blow. 
The initiative already was announced the past month of June and now already appears included in the annual memory of the General District attorney's Office of the State, according to which is a matter of a pilot project that will have a duration of a year. 
Its purpose is the reintegration of the conductor, for which this will also receive a course of road re-education. 
In the experience, besides the Fiscalia General of Segurida Road, they will participate the General Direction of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for the Security of the Car (FITSA). 
According to the statistics, between a 30% and a 75% of the motorists denounced more than one time by conducting drunken catches again the car. 
The alcolock would avoid it since is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in air exhaled and impedes to start the car if the conductor does not blow abtes; or when is detected a concentration of alcohol is over it permitted. 
Its price is over the 1,000 euro and raid by account of the guilty person. 
In this sense, a study carried out in US in 2007 showed that the vehicles equipped with these devices reduce even in a 65% the infractions during the first year of establishment. 
And in Spain is calculated that would be able to save the life to 115 people each year. 
The measure themselves to adhere to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to undertake those behaviors before derive in penal crimes. 
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done for ordinary way, and, nevertheless, the necessary reform by the penal way requires a reform in a constitutional law. 
The device yet is not found available in the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although already has been established of experimental way in some industrial vehicles and of public utility. 
Exactly tomorrow, the Congress of the Representatives will vote tomorrow an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party in which is proposed to install in the school buses this system, the same as has been carries out in France.

With British exactness, at 17,40 o'clock, the predicted hour in the program, landed in the presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF the airplane of the Spanish air force in which they travelled the Princes of Asturias. 
The sun was of withdrawal but its rays still obliged to use the hand by way of visor to see the real couple to descend of the airplane.

But the Mexican press yes knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the trip. 
They are many the ones that expect in the hangar of the airport hit to the red carpet and to a military fence formed by 27 marines that interpret saves it from honors. 
The Prince appears smiling, dress of blue marine, and she, the Princess, long hair to the wind, very temperate, he does not utilize its 'peep-toes' habitual, perhaps they had communicated him that in the DF threatened storm. 
They give a smile and a simple stop to the photographers before passing to the room in which expects the official delegation. 
In the door of the hotel in which they are lodged, one of the four large of the city, a reporter expects them dicharachera of the Mexican television. 
The gifted better prize of the fashion 
Possibly there be not place in the most appropriate world to present a fashionable prize, that Paris and possibly there be not a designer I live more exquisite and bont live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of the new talents of the fashion. 
Is gifted with a prize of 300,000 euro. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winning of the first edition, looked at its designs in the shop window of Mango in the number 54 of the boulevard Haussmann of Paris and almost cried of the emotion. 
Certainly, that is the second larger store of the firm in Europe and has just inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.

So many events, you united to the desire to thank him to the designer Valentino that to preside the jury of the contest, they did that we finished in a supper of luxury in the opera Garnier of Paris. 
With the proximity of the Chagals more exquisite, the presidential table of gala prepared by Mango, lit up still more spectacular. 
Nati, with the heart parted of grief and doing of intestines heart, by the recent death of its brother, a suit of the House was put and some garnitures of ELAH, that cut the respiration, and of the arm of its son Luis - a tube of almost two meters long - accompanied to Valentino in the presidency of its supper homage. 
Andik, owner and Mister of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that finished, next to the baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because both he had been lent them to two ladies. 
Mónica Cross, that responded to the store with pants and shirt - of own design - and for the supper was transformed with a black long sexy dress, was touched when in the nocturnal walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet trial room and she, recalling other times, got to one of the bars and did an I threaten of 'grand plie'. 
Inés Tailor did not remain to the walk by the dependences of the palace, but before he taught us in the telephone mobile photos of his son. 
To the next morning we could be happy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another tube that displaces in motorcycle - and by John Travolta, that arrived at the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with its sheets, its towels and having asked previously, that there was not smells in its room. 
You crash under the sky crashed of Paris. 
Oh là là, c' est the vie. 
1001, the number antiestrés 
There is not 1000 but 1000 more a ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life. 
And as if that were not enough, all they are met in a book that will bring the relaxation to the bookstores September 30. 
The alarm clock almost punishes when sounds each morning at 7 in the morning, but still is worse to be imagined wrapped in the agitated rhythm that imposes the current life. 
The office is called tension and the back pain computer. 
The stress is evil of the 21st century. 
But there is not one neither two methods to fight the daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnection with the labor world. 
Not, the number elevates to, nothing more and nothing less, that 1001. 
To the margin of the positions of yoga, the classical massage or the processing of 'spa', Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the flavor and minutes of each one. 
The work antiestrés is called '1001 ways to be relaxed' and its calm will arrive at the bookstores of the hand of the editorial one Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If someone considers that he is not possible to reach the tranquility in environments as the work or through the personal relations, this 'manual' he contradicts such belief. 
Besides, it offers other procedures as to be in contact with the nature or prescriptions 100% natural that contribute to the relaxation. 
If the adrenaline no longer runs for your veins to restore the equilibrium of the body and the stress has become a problem, is hour to be sat down in the sofa, to disconnect the mind and to be concentrate on the reading. 
Speaking asleep 
Some children speak at night. 
Me do not I refer to these that awake very awakened counting us something that has passed the previous day, but to children that speak being asleep. 
The first time that happens maybe you carry you a scare, but in reality does not have importance. 
It is a benign alteration of the dream that is called somniloquios. 
Is quite frequent, above all in children and adolescents. 
Sure that at more than one they have counted him that spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can appear of very sporadic way (once in the life for example associated to an episode of high fever), or of more periodic way (every day, once a week, once in months. ..), the next day the boy does not recall anything. 
Not an unique cause exists that determine its apparition. 
Often they go related to other alterations of the dream as they are used to being the nightmares, the nocturnal terrors, the nocturnal enuresis (to be done pis asleep) or the somnambulism, but does not have reason to be thus. 
As already we have mentioned previously also they can go checked associates of very high fever, to situations of stress or overexcitement. 
At any rate is a phenomenon little studied. 
The intensity with the one that appears also very variable. 
It can be that speak in a tone of tranquil voice, loose words, a murmur or all the contrary thing (shouts, crying, long speeches. ..). 
In the cases in which the demonstration is very intense would agree to observe the boy and to consult with a specialist, to verify if there is some question that is generating a lot of anxiety and exit of this way gives him. 
We have said that is a benign alteration, therefore does not have processing, unless go associate to another alteration of the dream that yes can treat (for example, if goes associate to apnea of the dream or to a picture of stress). 
What yes can cause is to keep in mind a series of very simple preventive measures such as: 
Trying not to excite a lot the boy before be going to sleep. 
Therefore to seek tranquil play and to avoid programs or series of television that be of fear or a little violent. 
With very nervous children and that costs them a lot to be relaxed, techniques of relaxation can be utilized to help to acquire a certain internal calm. 
This will favor that the boy can have a more tranquil dream. 
Once the somniloquias appear you try to maintain the calm. 
You recall that they are inoffensive for the boy and that the next day will not recall anything of what has passed. 
Useful counsels 
It do not awake. 
Is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break him the dream. 
Although it is speaking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting. 
You recall that if is shown very distressed during various episodes would agree to consult or to ascertain what is what generates so much anxiety in the boy. 
If it is understood what says (that is not it more habitual), do not fall in the temptation to do him an interrogation to coax him information. 
You will not obtain anything, because upon being asleep is not conscious as to organize its thought. 
Besides you oiréis what says, but do not you know what is dreaming to say that, with which a lot cared for in how interpret the information and with the conclusions that remove. 
Never tell him the boy that can interrogate it at night to know its secrets. 
Not even in jest. 
That generates a lot of anxiety. 
All in all, you do not worry, is not swum bad, is an episode that hard only some minutes. 
Illhaeusern at last! 
The club of soccer, Illhaeusern, found at last the road of the victory in its field after a long period of shortage. 
Without they to have done a good party, the team created many occasions of goal and was capable to do a goal to win the party. 
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty to be expressed. 
After a first attempt of the captain Kauffmann that grazed the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern almost was going to take the "to be able" and for shift Fonderflick from a distance, then with up the Hirn, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to impede the defense of Dannemarie. 
In front, we did not leave to pass the midfield player and we left only Riahi in position of attack. 
The principle of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoreboard for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well situated to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 '). 
But the high-scoring one Illhousiens will not be able to savor a lot of time its happiness and will be obliged to return in the coat rooms a dozen minutes later and to leave thus its companions of team in numerical inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens that went back a little for "to compress" its defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important gabble, the ball passed very near the cross field.

But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by responsible for the national committee of the fishing, that did not maintain its movement. 
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen did not abandon" and "do not they want to be displaced toward Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the committee of the fishing of Lorient. 
The professional fishermen, that do not pay rates on the diesel oil, they pay at present near 50 hundredth by liter but they consider that the financial break-even point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel oil with a lower price to 0.30 euro by liter.

"It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, old candidate of the opposition to the presidential election of 2006 and leader of the movement for European, because what is important is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power. 
If some representatives of the opposition enter the parliament, is because they will have been appointed but not chosen. 
"But its entrance to the parliament can signify apparitions in television, meetings in the regions and proposals of law. " 
The opposition therefore should enter the political play because "one must begin the dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, that has many debts in front of Russia, enters crisis, and if us do not we reform, we are in danger to be done a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent ". 
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for the security and the cooperation in Europe that continued the electoral process recognize not the validity of the voting. 
It underlines that the figures of participation seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote with anticipation (the 26% of the voters in Minsk) favored the handlings. 
"¿You have noted the elections? It interrogates the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of two last political prisoners freed in August of this year. 
There was not nobody in the polling places. 
And there will be at most five representatives of the opposition to the parliament, the ones that agree better to the power. " 
The silence at night returns again in the plaza of October. 
In the television, the president Loukachenko and the members of the electoral central commission are congratulated for their success. 
The interview - Blood is again sure 
Héma-Quebec celebrated yesterday its 10° anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to be been happy, because Héma-Quebec has been again one of the efficient and surest suppliers of blood in the world. 
And above all, it regained the confidence of the public that seriously had been hesitated for the scandal of the blood contaminated in the years 1980 and 1990. 
As it is known, the national reserves of blood administered by the Service of blood transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross have been contaminated for the Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the virus of the hepatitis C during the years 1980. 
Set against this drama and to the discontent of the public, the government of Canada did in February of 1994 a public survey, presided by the judge Horacio Krever, that intended to clear the circumstances that had conducted to such tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such disaster reproduce not itself more. 
While the judge Krever delayed in presenting its relation, certain provinces then created a committee that had as an objective to plan a new system of management of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau complied this mission. 
Consequently of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Quebec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Company of blood for supply all the other provinces and both territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Quebec began its activities, almost the 38% of the people had still confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
After they to have done many efforts to improve the security of the a lot of and blood products I work during the years that continued, we have recovered the confidence of the public ", says before affirm proudly that at the beginning of 2008, near the 94% of the population quebequesa had in the successive thing confidence in Héma-Quebec. 
The doctor Décary recalls nevertheless in which "the confidence is something extremely fragile". 
Since its creation, September 28, 1998, Héma-Quebec applied the principle of precaution. 
In that epoch, we attended in Europe to the birth of numerous cases of the variant human of the illness of the crazy cow, a new variant one of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, account Décary. 
And we did not know if this illness would be able to be transmitted for the blood. 
Then we support us in one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when him do not we know and when a serious illness can emanate of that, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterized for a degeneration of the brain that carries inevitably to the death, we establish measures of exclusion. 
In April of 1999, therefore we deny the blood of the people that had remained more than one month in the United Kingdom since the 1980. 
But, it does some years, has been shown out of every doubt that this illness is transmitted for the blood. 
This episode showed us so the principle of precaution that applied had of the sense. " 
In 1999 it appeared in the market an a lot more sensitive technique of detection of the HIV: the tests of acid nucleído that permit to detect directly in the blood of the donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, in which the tests utilized were supported up to now. 
The tests of acid nucleído permitted to shorten the period among the moment in which the person has been infected and the moment in which the first virus they can be detected in the blood by ours technical, explains the specialist. 
We could reduce this period in a lower duration to a week. 
We diminish thus substantially the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them. 
These improvements permitted to descend considerably the risk to contract the been by a transfusion of blood. 
Nowadays, a person each 12 million runs the risk to receive blood contaminated by the HIV. 
"That means that there will be that to distribute 12 million blood products before someone be infected by the HIV. 
Thus since Héma-Quebec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, they will pass more than 24 years before happen unexpectedly a case of broadcast of the HIV by a blood product. 
I believe that is able nowadays to receive or to prescribe a transfusion of blood to recover the health without worries", affirms the leader of the direction of Héma-Quebec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products. 
Never it is known which pathogen would be able to emerge in the system. 
Last year appeared in the island of the Meeting the virus Chikungunya that, to example of the virus of the western Nile, is transmitted for an insect in the blood. 
One must be constantly vigilant ", pursues the doctor Décary before underlining that besides a sure provision, Héma-Quebec should also predict a sufficient provision. 
"The needs enlarge because the population ages. 
Since the processing anti carcinogenic more aggressive, the patients often need an injection of red corpuscles or of platelets. 
The aging of the population has also consequences on the network of the donors of blood that regroups on the average only the 3% of Quebequeses admissible to the donation of blood. " 
All the people with good health, of 18 years and that correspond to the criteria of admissibility they are able nevertheless to donate blood each 56 days, that is to say six times a year. 
On the average, the 14% of the people that proposes their blood they are not accepted, because they suffer of been or of malaria, for example, and if they travelled in a country where reign the malaria, they will be excluded during a period of a year. 
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of the hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But one must renew to the members of this network of donors to the extent that they age and more they cannot donate their blood. 
But it is difficult to convince the people to donate its blood, but above all to retain them and to incite them to be regular donor. 
Since the current life is very wild, we find seldom the time to spend an hour for donate its blood ", is afflicted Francine Décary. 
With a budget of 297 annual million dollars, Héma-Quebec supplies not only blood products, but also you woven human, among the ones that bony grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that almost exclusively is utilized for the large burned. 
These weavings are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, that negotiates also the public only bank of blood of the umbilical cord in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that old was considered as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood of cells mother that can be utilized for the processing of serious illnesses like the leukemia. 
"We have celebrated some weeks ago, it put in the bank of our thousandth sample of blood of the umbilical cord and expects to remove more than thousand of these per year. 
We would have that to begin to propose it for grafts at the beginning of next year ", I need Doctor Décary that describes this program of he takes of blood of cord as very popular. 
"Many moms are disappointed of be not able to enjoy this", since Héma-Quebec does not have resources to propose this costly and complex program in all the hospitals of Quebec. 
Softbol - The Impact in the semifinals 
The Impact of Montreal was qualified for the semifinals of the qualifying series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 all in all end) at the cost of the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, during the second and decisive parted of the end rooms series, in the Stadium Saputo.

Charest is in charge of the North 
The prime minister does not exclude to set in motion elections before ends of year 
As quick as finish the general counsel of the liberal Party, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new minister of the Health, Yves Bolduc (of left), tries to cause to elect during the partial election of today. 
Rejecting the limits of ours last great north border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force being remained in the large lines, to the term of the general counsel of the liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during their speech, were projected images. 
They paraded, in three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, of mine, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. 
Large media as during the electoral period. 
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although caused saw that its schedule was very full. 
The "Flat North" it is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which he understands an agreement on the labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario. 
Often it mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently, the north opening - the northern territory to the 49° parallel - had never been object of a presentation. 
The prime minister was limited nevertheless to explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but did not give a term, amounts of investment, neither priority I need in the future projects. 
What above all more could be developed they are: particularly the hidroelectricidad, the forest, but above all the mining sector, drugged by the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of the public infrastructures. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to the enumeration of the Mr. Charest. 
This "territory two large times as France", "is our house, is in Quebec. 
Only it is not home our, but is in us ", insisted, as to show that requested a myth national founder. 
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relation with the North, underlined: the flood toward the gold in Abitibi, the engineering quebequesa, the Bay James. 
"It belongs us, is ours future", added, after to have done a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him. 
The North, the 70% of the territory quebequés, understands a part of the farm laborer that Quebec always claimed, needed the prime minister during the press conference. 
"Is a traditional position that all the governments reiterated. 
There is a line of border in which do not they go in agreement for a very long time and, when the occasion is presented, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government ", indicated. 
Besides, "with the climatic changes, one must rethink to our north vision", declared speaking of the passage of the northwest, that each year due to the foundry of the ice will be opened. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that to occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit, particularly the youths. 
Two old ministers that two different parties stem from, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (old representative of the party quebequés of Ungava), already began consultations near about thirty communities. 
An interdepartmental committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transportation and natural Resources) has an important role began some works. 
The prime minister does not exclude an important encounter, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given". 
The north development would be done in conformity with the principles of the sustainable development. 
The North Plan "will be arranged, orderly and respectful of the environment", promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a that is in continuity with that of the first liberal ministers that preceded him. 
"As the liberals that preceded us, we have thought of another way to transform the challenges in new occasions of growth and of development. " 
This was one of the recurrent themes of weekend, that began Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50° anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Central one Beauharnois in Reservoir Adélard-Godbout. 
"Of Godbout, that created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that did the tranquil Revolution and the nationalization of the hidroelectricidad, in Bourassa that did the Bay James our parted knew to forge the future", declared Juan Charest. 
In the press conference, invoked another reference, that conservative, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, prime minister since the 1957 to the 1963. 
Touching the theme of the project of hydroelectric reservoir of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest underlined that its put in service is predicted by the 2012. 
"This remains among us, but preveo to be there", trusted its militants, stirring up applauses. 
Really, the prime minister, that said in April that would not take place elections in 2008 and without doubt not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility to set in motion a voting this autumn, what the law permits him. 
It underlines that its schedule is not nevertheless full, particularly on account of a mission of the counsel of the confederacy in China and a summit Quebec-New York York. 
The general counsel of weekend supplied the liberal leader a platform that contained nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that did not have problems for to be accepted: the Liberal Party of the Quebec demands particularly the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
It desires also that Quebec name to members of the Counsel of the broadcasting and of the Canadian telecommunications and that these have the right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
Of the side of the opposition, we received the large lines of the North Plan with skepticism. 
The leader of the party quebequés, Pauline Marois, caused stood out the Politics of north development of Quebec that the government Landry had launched in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, arriving at the power in 2003, renounced to apply it. 
If it they to have done, "we would cause I would progress nowadays" commented Mrs Marois next to its candidate in Jean-Talon (voting that was performed today), Françoise Mercure. 
The Democratic Action of the Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan on behalf of the government. 
"But what is desired, is that this be not just a spectacle", commented the leader Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, that returns from holidays today. 
Letters - A country dishonored 
It is the Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (¡oh irony!) in the cabinet Harper, that last summer was permitted to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada. 
Dishonoring thus this woman that carried an incessant battle for the justice and that deserves all our admiration what says all on the relations of the prime minister and of Stephen Harper. 
We are across a government that is the unique one, among all the western countries implied, that has not repatriated to its national one that is locked in the country of concentration of Guantánamo. 
Is a government that does not keep in mind by no means the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent when the facts that are reproached they occurred him. 
The only government that, in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Covenant of Geneva, denies its promise and leaves to live in inhuman conditions a boy-soldier. 
The unique one that chonta with a false justice to evaluate the guilt of the defendant. 
We recall that the UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of the Canadian lawyers, particularly, they maintain the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to that enjoyment of the benefit of a fair process in Canada. 
It is this government that closes the eyes on the torture: little imports him that an adult youth be psychological destroyed, without doubt for always after so many years of levyings. 
Do not yet we realize that, but we attend at this time an insidious erosion of ours right, of our liberty and of ours "democracy", that is the word that Harper continuous to repeat and that no sense makes. 
Already the hour has arrived in which none moral exists more: we can mistreat, tortured, to imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen as wants the leader of up to now minority Government (¿what will happen after October 14?). 
Many voters believe that they will find the salvation in a party that extols the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounced what did the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Mr. Toews the shame is caused by this renunciation and by nothing more. 
Opinion free - The speech orwelliano of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of September 17, Him Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian miner Barrick Gold. 
Continuing a logical one orwelliana, Barrick Gold affirms that the largest gold-bearing company in the world tried a process by defamation of six million euro against three authors and a small publishing house in order to causing a "transparent public debate". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, is not the truth that judge, above all in the case of pursuits by defamation, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference completely is hidden for Mr. Garver. 
Reason, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to carry a public debate would be to damage whoever dares to maintain a contrary position to his? 
The result of the suit has little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada should spend you add considerable in order to preparing its defense and of fighting, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers maintained by the pockets almost without fund of the miner. 
The tactic, in these uneven fights, is often consists of ruining to him demanded in order to imposing a friendly arrangement that will gag the opposition besides frightening whoever will dare to examine again the question. 
If Barrick Gold truly to have wanted a public debate, is in front of the public opinion that would have had that to present its vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what it is done in various of countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are done normally by the change of ideas and not to blows of club. 
It sufficed therefore that the miner to open its books, its expedients and to establish a true debate, through the newspapers, the mass media, the publications and the financing of independent teams of search that would have been able to clear the question. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust in the public opinion and rejects the petitions and the letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada. 
Possibly Mr. Garver would be able to explain how can ask a debate "public" despising the opinions of this? 
According to the vice president, seems that this word appoints only the very full lawyers and not for all the Canadians; that represents a view very limited of the concept. 
In democracy, the critics have also the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or what does not want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that maintains the authors and to the publishers of Noir Canada does it above all because rejects the brutal way of the miner. 
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and to judge it, but having as arguments civilized changes base, and not in the framework of what many people perceive like a pursuit-clamp (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just placed a request with regard to the authors of Noir Canada suggesting them to that they utilize not more this word). 
Besides the surreal speech of the Mr. Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the liberty of university search and of the truth, essential pair all the democratic companies. 
It denies the credible right to cite sources and to do a debate on the facts and the interpretations, that represent the base of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and to discuss on subjects that desagradan to the rich businesses of this world in a country as Canada, on pain of many pursuits, who will be able to do it? 
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a transparent and public debate, would be able to cause continuing the scientific norms utilized by the authors of Noir Canada. 
Has the right of answer. 
The university world, to which we belong, knows for a very long time to administer the debates and the disagreements and to resolve the conflicts. 
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold shows clearly that, contrary to what intends, does not want to do a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and already is hour that the governments place devices that limit this kind of abusive pursuits. 
Operation of rescue of Wall Street - Democratic and republicans agree 
The administration Bush and the leaders of the Congress, at the same time republican and democratic, finally they arrived at an agreement yesterday on the plan of most important economic rescue since the Great Depression of the years 30. 
The new version of the plan of 700 thousand American million dollars that intends to brake the financial crisis that shakes to Wall Street since months ago has to be still confirmed for both Cameras of the Congress. 
It foresees particularly: a better control on the part of the chosen of its put in application, of new mechanisms that intend to assure the reimbursement of the public money invested, of the new dispositions to contain the number of houses impeded the lack of payment, as well as a right of overseeing on the full salaries to the leaders of the businesses helped. 
The American secretary of the Treasure, Henry Paulson, the president of the Camera of the Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the republican representative in the negotiating table, the senator Judd Gregg, they announced the good news some minutes after midnight, yesterday, to the term of a marathon of negotiations che lasted two days. 
"We carry out large progresses with a view to an agreement that will be efficient in the markets", declared the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
"All has been done to put under cover the economy and the Americans ordinary before the current crisis in Wall Street", explained the democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the traumatism, the chaos and the disruptions on the daily life of the Americans will be immense", declared the republican one Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had been finished very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the humor of the investors. 
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning. 
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, that have adhered late to the negotiations, they were shown more well favorable for the agreement, without forgetting nevertheless to squeeze their discontent of to be obliged to arrive at this extremity. 
The democratic senator Barack Obama was conferred him certain dispositions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would permit the owners to conserve his residence and the on the salary of the leaders of the surviving businesses by the State. 
"When it is asked them to the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures on account of the irresponsibility of some, not one must congratulate. 
But these measures are necessary ", commented in the American television. 
Its republican adversary, John McCain, Interrogated in another chain to know if would vote for the plan proposed, responded that: "I would like to see the details, but I expect to vote it. " 
"The important points that read [show] that is something that we will have to digest and with the one that we will be able to advance. 
It said that the option to do not anything is not acceptable ". 
The plan of 700 billion intends to buy with the money of the taxpayers the doubtful debts, the assets to risks and unsalable of the American financial institutions. 
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis caused by the crash of a bubble real estate agency that first carried to the sinking of the mortgage loans of risk before being extended to other more common forms of titles of credit (PCAA) and of causing a congealment of liquidity and a rush of the banks and of the financial institutions. 
Is a group of chosen republican that had done to change the first project in agreement, last week. 
We believe that we have left the stagnation since the democrats accepted that certain assets "toxic" of the companies in difficulty be only policyholders by the government, rather than bought. 
With the objective to file the harshness for everyone in the Congress, also we add a disposition that stipulated that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, would be able to impose new rates that would intend to help to recover money. 
The new plan foresees the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which they will be able to be added 100 other billion if to the president seems the necessary. 
The payment of other 350 billion would have that to be confirmed by another vote on behalf of the Congress. 
On the other hand of its aid, Washington will obtain participations in the businesses helped that will be worth him dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm will be passed. 
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the procedures of embargoes that concerned the dwellings obtained with real estate loans according to this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and on the full cash clearings to the leaders of the businesses affected by the crisis. 
The architects of the plan would want to see it submitted to the voting of the Camera of the representatives from now on and to that of the Senate next Wednesday. 
In spite of all its efforts, yet is not sure that its plan will be approved. 
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, so much on behalf of the republicans as of the democrats. 
The republican one Scott Garrett, member of the commission of the finances of the camera, declared its voters that "with every evidence, Washington does not want to understand". 
"We have a very serious financial problem. 
Some solutions exist. 
But not the one that consists of removing benefit of the taxpayers ". 
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, that is a host of a small group in the Congress, he presents the problems of another way, but he arrives at the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred professors of economy, among the ones that three Nobel Prizes, they wrote us to tell us: we ask to the Congress not to be hurried and to examine attentively the way that one must take", declared yesterday. 
In this same moment, in Europe, we had again the test of the world nature of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting, the three countries of the Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euro (16.3 thousand million dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and of Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas brought to light that renounced to buy its competitor in bankruptcy since lost 2 billion euro (2.9 thousand million dollars) during the crisis of the real estate loans of risk in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and form splits of the twenty largest European banks and of the ten insurance largest. 
"This it is not money lost, declared yesterday the Dutch minister of the Finances, Wouter Bos. 
On the other hand, we recover a right of vote in the bank and influence. 
It is exactly something that the investors and the families appreciated now that the times are uncertain. " 
During this time, on the other side of the Spot, the British government seemed wanted to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take charge of all the pending loans in the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 billion euro (75.5 thousand million dollars) of real estate loans. 
The bank Spanish Santander brought to light yesterday that is the one that would buy the branch offices and the bank accounts of the British bank. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have that to nationalize since the principle of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon compromised 
Its blue eyes represented therefore time their triumph. 
The American actor with a charming smile had freed himself of his narcissistic side?

Its modesty, its sensibility and a talent that was evident will also have moved away it of the registration to be able that have the true sacred monsters. 
But how great runner of fund! 
Paul Newman, dead person Friday, to 83 years, on account of a lung cancer in its ranch of Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American movies of the years annals remains. 
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom seemed a lot and that was considered for a long time as a rival one in the movies, more prudent in its play, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the liberty and of the crash of the dramatic covenants. 
The blood mixed do often magnificent children. 
It was born in Ohio in 1925, of German Jewish father and of mother of Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.

This man that military by the civil law was also the pilot car that was classified in second position in the 24 hours of Him Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although member of a model couple formed since the 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
They disappear also with him the secret sides of this discreet, secret star and compromised, allergic to the scandals of the show business that we do not know very well. 
Is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman caused the vertigo to the movie fans this weekend, while they clash their large roles in the black screen of the memories. 
More than one half century of the seventh American art in perpetual move parades him. 
Many memories return to memory as the cow-boy with charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man that rejects their sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Jack on the roof of zinc adapted of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
More near us (1990), we evoke to its sensitive one Mister Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not comply all its promises. 
Other as Paul Newman have passed to the history of the movies.

Player of bitter billiards and avenger in the magnificent movie The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the personage in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, that was worth him in 1987 its ONLY Oscar among nine nominations. 
This face that changes with the years, was he. 
Still he. 
The epochs change during their career. 
The youths know it above all thanks to Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of orthodox little ice hockey. 
Its fans see it again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen. 
With a last role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the curl was curled. 
Contraryly to several legends of the movies that abandoned quite quick the career, Newman remained a lot in the world of the movies, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its annals and its concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in" the underplaying "and that judges its benefits too much supported. 
The profession was always easy for the beautiful one Paul Newman to which the roles arrived for a long time without doing nothing. 
Nevertheless it interpreted less often gallant the role of youth that of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, rascals or desperate, whose characteristics reflected the rebellions. 
As the producer, Newman revealed sides its true not very known modest sensibility. 
Its movie Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian one Margaret Laurence), with its wife Joanne Woodward on paper main, described a female portrait of melancholy. 
He that lost its son Scott on account of overdose dedicated him its movie Harry and Are in 1984, work of modesty and of sadness. 
"Among the numerous homages that unchained itself yesterday for Newman, its great friend and old comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence" 
Generosity, love of the existence are important characteristics of the actor dead. 
Of the other side of its career of legend, hides also a great militant for the civil law, the ecology, the independent movies, a nonconformist against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We will have seen a lot its face to reign on the vinaigrette sauce rowboats, of the sauces, of the crackers and of other food, judging this method as a method of badly flavor, although began like a gag. 
The benefits of these sales were given to their Foundation for the infancy in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than being pleased of its myth, there will be itself compromised to the end. 
It left them its five daughters a letter that contained these phrases: "Always and even the end, your father was incredibly thanked by its good star. 
Was a privilege to be there. " 
And a privilege for us of to have followed the career of a so clear American artist and so generous. 
All in all a model citizen. 
What is what produced in the factory of bills Zuschlag &amp; Co. ? 
Very quick, October 8, the criminal trial will be initiated against János Zuschlag and its accomplices. 
The politician is accused and to his significant damage frauds to commit accomplices, of way of business, continuously and in form organized besides other crimes, among these the forgery of documents. 
According to the District attorney's Office they employed for own end the funds obtained in the public contests justifying in many occasions the compliance of the tasks with false bills. 
The public funds and that of the City Hall - in its totality some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private people. 
The method, that was brought to light for the investigators also, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public contests with false bills behind which there was not real execution, the different associations never complied their obligations assumed. 
According to the accusation, the majority of the bills they were false. 
For it they obtained the checkbooks in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the seals circulate you were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the question that in name of what business should be carried out the fake bill was decided among others in that tour by the Upper Region of the Balatón where János Zuschlag sent to István Sides. 
This last it confessed that for this end should elect boarding houses and restaurants. 
It asked bill by their consumption and these they served of model to concoct the bills that presented among others in the contests of the Department of Sports and Youthful Matters, in the Department of Labor and Social Matters, as well as in the City Hall of the Capital. 
These bills were signed mostly by István Sides and his accomplice András who according to our informations more well wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public subsidies. 
During one of its "field trips" Sides chose a brewery. 
According to two bills sent off in 2003 by Zuschlag and its accomplices, this gastronomic center provided the food for a group of ninety people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
Nevertheless - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place. 
In the same way, the bill sent off in the summer of 2002 for the Foundation Jobb - later call Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal errors and contextuales. 
Therefore a boarding house of the locality of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not be lodged there in a night, nevertheless in the bill they were evident hundred and thirty people. 
But the bill-makers of great fantasy also exaggerated when they indicated to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. therefore in the bookkeeping of the same one - according to the informations given to the District attorney's Office - there were not documents to name of Jobb and of Hoppá. 
Farkas, the manager of said company, informed him hvg.hu that when was cited by the district attorney's office and the bills they showed him, already knew that was a matter of false documents. 
"In the seal the name of our business and the NIF appeared in incorrect place." 
It added: besides the formal problems did neither agree that according to the bill a hundred people were lodged, since have only eleven rooms in which do not fit so many people. 
Besides, in the bill foods were included also, while the restaurant time ago that does not function. 
The enthusiastic bill-makers were not reported neither that the chosen travel agency in Budapest organizes exclusively travel to the outside, so that in the bill of payment in cash they indicated foolishly as service a trip inside Hungary, which did neither coincide with the bills expedition practice of the agency. 
Besides -just as it was known during the investigation- they included in the document the VAT also, in spite of the fact that the trips out of the territory of the European Union were tax-free. 
Among others things the measure of the VAT also was incorrect in the four documents sent off by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb since the services of said business are not loaded with a 25 but only with 15 percent of VAT, besides the employees of the hotel only extended you bill machine-made nevertheless the bill was manual. 
Besides the "shippers" made other mistakes also, as in the case of a company in which they put in the bill as activity carried out the haulage to which - was known during the investigations of the district attorney's office - does not carry out the company founded like the consultant of investments. 
Likewise by formal differences - inadequate format of the bill, false seal- was known that they are false the bills sent off for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont. 
Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp of Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied to have sent off those bills. 
The falsificadores did neither lend attention to that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in process of liquidation, therefore the responsible for the process of liquidation - according to our informations - denied to have sent off such document. 
They sent off consciously the bills 
Another group of the false bill-makers they are constituted by those the ones that they were conscious that they should send off you bill fictitious. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, to request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, sent off bill by value of some four million HUF to name of the Foundation Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért. 
To the manager of the Collab Kft. - According to the accusation - one of the defendants convinced it, Ludovic Györfi, to send off you bill fictitious. 
In the same way collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices the Biogate Kft., at present low process of liquidation, that in 2003 supplied bills by an approximate value of five million HUF to the foundation Jobb Alapítvány, to the association Atlasz Egyesület and to the association Egyesület, without real economic activity behind. 
Do not there was capital movement neither, therefore later annulled the bills prepared but they forgot to cause to be evident in their documents to this company. 
In the following group of the false bill-makers they are included those that have some linking with the defendants. 
Thus for example Iván Kubatov was the demandadero of the ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with fictitious headquarters in Budapest, that was occupied with the commerce of fuels and of vehicles. 
This company sent off numerous bills by an approximate value of 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December of 2005 on the sale of data processing media. 
According to the data of the investigation these bills were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, that from September 14, 2005 is low process of liquidation. 
The manager of this company was a Rumanian to who Iván Kubatov attended to also the documents related to the business between 2002 and 2005. 
We have informations that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that sent off to name of the company you bill for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount he himself. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. they were founded for Rumanian bricklayers to espresso request of Iván Kubatov. 
Nevertheless, none of the companies functioned really owed - according to the defendant - to that did not receive work. 
But it removed benefit of these businesses, since to request of their accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the documents of registration of the business, sent off bills to name of the companies for the organizations linked with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the AND-Generáció. 
Kubatov in name of the Cash Investment, of the Delta Trió, of the Fa-Bani Jos, of the Jos Investment and of the Linaxtrade gave on the whole 15 bills to different companies by a value of 14.2 million HUF. 
The District attorney's Office considered that Kubatov received the VAT and the 10% of the amount of the bills. 
That man took advantage of even the company in partnership Szi-Beri to send off you bill fictitious utilized in the contest of Biztos Pont. 
The AND-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in the month of January from 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), company of public utility of the Socialist Party. 
Of the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not utilize the money for the objectives of the contest. 
So that this be not discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious bills received of the Works Team Kft. 
These they were the bills found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had in the headquarters of the Department of Education. 
It splits of the defendants probably they will relate in the judgment - just as they did in the District attorney's Office - the course of the forgery of the bills. 
It more interesting it will be able to be the confession of the own main defendant János Zuschlag, if decides to dismantle all. 
Therefore its confessions up to now very have not been detailed and although repeatedly promised to speak of all, this has not done it to the present. 
The question is: What interest has to do it?, therefore perhaps in exchange for the refund of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists arrived at an agreement with him so that Zusi assume all the responsibilities. 
Who, on the other hand, for these days until could be offended, since to alleviate its prison conditions requested house arrest, but was denied him repeatedly. 
While the numerous authors of economic crimes of very upper value, that never returned the money, they stroll freely or at least they can expect in its own home the sentence, he does not have possibility for that. 
Psychology of them recovered: Why do we spend more money? 
The participants of the auctions are prone to spend more money and to overrate the product. 
The neurologists and economists of the University of new York discovered the neurological bases - economic of this apparently irrational and known conduct. 
According to the study appeared in the magazine Science, the people does not want to lose in competences as the auctions of eBay, therefore prefers to pay even one excessive price. 
The scientists tried to establish the neurological plan of this "play" through experimental auctions. 
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the system of functional magnetic resonance was examined by means of (fMRI) the active zones of the brain of the participating people in the experiment. 
In both play they could win money the participants, but during the auctions, where is fundamental element to wager more than the other, upon losing the play intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex. 
This zone of the brain, besides many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "car prize" of the nervous system. 
Thus according to the scientists, the increase of the bets is explained like a prevention for cause not an intense reaction of the stratum. 
To support its theory, the economists of the scientific group carried out also a study of financial monitoring. 
In this experiment three groups wagered against a person in different circumstances. 
To the control group simply communicated him themselves the real value of the product in question, and its members wagered. 
To another group besides it him was promised that if they win, they would receive 15 dollars more than prize. 
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in case to lose the auction the members of the group lost even that money. 
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one stood out itself the triumph and for the other the failure. 
Nevertheless, verifying the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group that played "against the failure" were willing to wager even more than the members of the control group and of the group "winning". 
"These results cannot be deduced of any existing economic theory previously. 
Therefore those up to now they explained the phenomena of the auctions only with the happiness to win and with the prevention of the risks. 
Only the visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that now we arrive at a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the faculty of economy of the University of new York. 
Hepatitis: When should go the doctor? 
In the world some five hundred million people suffer of hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary the chronic illness of the liver is considered one of the main causes of the death. 
It is calculated in a hundred thousand the number of infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive processing therefore many of the sick do not know that they are infected. 
The denomination of hepatitis is the common name of different illnesses of the liver caused by virus. 
The symptoms seem a lot; are characteristic the infection of the liver and the jaundice, but its pathogenic agents and the caused illnesses are very different. 
The virus of the hepatitis in dependence of the pathogenic agent spread by means of two main forms: the hepatitis TO and AND by eating way (for example with water or food infected), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with the blood and with corporal humors (sperm, humor of the vagina, saliva). 
It is recommendable to the travelers to be protected by means of vaccinates against the virus TO and B, against the C not vaccines exist. 
The symptoms of the hepatitis TO appear two or three weeks after consuming the food infected, is declared through a badly general state, weakness, abdominal pain and queasiness. 
After it they appear in the skin and in the white one of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement is put clearly, the urine of dark color and the healing can last even two - three weeks. 
Yearly a million people die in the world in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by the hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this illness. 
The main reason of it is that according to the calculations, only one of each ten infected receives pharmacological processing. 
The hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without processing can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer. 
The majority of them infected does not know that is sick because this pathological agent destroys in gradual form the cells of the liver and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later. 
Therefore is very important the premature recognition, the systematic medical control. 
It is a lot more frequent this illness in three groups: the people that had blood transfusion before 1991, the drug users and the ones that carry tattooings. 
Currently there are some 200 million people in the world that suffer of hepatitis C chronic. 
As to this illness can be discovered with a routine control of laboratory also, is worthwhile to consult with the doctor of the family upon experiencing some unknown symptom. 
The illness has healing if is discovered to time, is possible to exterminate the virus of the agency, thus the contagion can be suppressed and to prevent the cancer. 
September 30 is the World Day of the Hepatitis, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representatives of the sick. 
Its objective is to call the attention to the causes of the chronic infections of the liver caused by the virus and to the importance of its premature recognition. 
It hurts less to who believe in God? 
According to the result of a recent investigation, the religious faith has soothing effect that alleviated also the death of the martyrs of the Catholicism. 
The scientists of the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment: they analyzed that the religious belief in what way influences in the human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph. 
In the framework of this singular experiment they applied electric collision to 12 catholic believers and to the same quantity of atheists, in the meantime all they were looking at a painting of the Virgin one María. 
According to the results, the catholic believers were capable to exclude most of their pain. 
Thanks to the technique of I scan of the human brain, could be verified that the catholic believers were capable to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This experiment is the first one of the series of investigations in which next to the educators they participate also scientific, philosophers and theologians of the different departments of the University. 
The analysis occurred in the following way; they set an at hand left sparkling instrument of the patient, which applied the electric collision. 
The investigators asked the participants of the experiment that set her look in two paintings; to the Virgin one María, work of Sassoferrato of the century 17 and to the Lady of the ermine of Leonardo gives Vinci of the century 15. 
The investigators had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin María would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose the oil of Leonardo because was not too different of the other, and they thought that had soothing effect. 
The patients passed half an hour in a scanner of MRI, receiving in that period 20 electric collisions in four successive parts while observed the painting of religious theme or well the other. 
The Catholics affirmed that upon looking at to the Virgin María they felt in "security" as the people "protected", "they calmed down and in its heart the peace reigned". 
Upon observing the picture of religious theme they felt 12 percent less than pain that when they looked at the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias that also participated in the experiment, he thinks that with any so stunning image a similar effect with the atheists can be obtained also, only one must find the adequate image. 
"We should find the portrait of a person by the one that feel very positively, as by a mother or a father" - said the psychologist. 
The bishop anglicano Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation. 
"The exercise of the faith would owe and in many cases truly changes our personality" - added Wright. 
After these formidable results remains a single questioning one: What effect would have for the regulation of the pain if was shown him to the faithful the Madonna of Leonardo or of another painter of its size? 
Perhaps the vision of a Virgin one María high-quality would throw still better results? 
You are what say of you same 
In its tenth birthday the Google can affirm: can be found him so much in the pocket of the people, as in the sky above its head; knows where they passed its holidays, why doctors visit and what is what interests them. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this not yet is sufficient. 
On the other hand the skeptics that do a parallel with the vision orweliana do not they see the essence of the Web 2,0. 
Eric Schmidt does little declared to the periodic one Financial Times that the main objective of Google is to meet possible the greater quantity of personal data on its users, and this is necessary to be able to comply the original objectives of the founders of Google: "¡We meet in a system all the informations of the world!". 
According to the leader of the Google, the company even after ten years of work that revolved to the World is still in the initial phase of the pledge to be able to treat all the information. 
To the question that what is what is going to pass inside five years Schmidt answered thus: wanted that the Google could answer to the questions as "¿What tomorrow ago?" or "¿Which would be the work that better would agree me?" - Nevertheless, the software they will not be able to answer to apparently so simple questions while not sufficient informations of the users exist. 
Not all the internet users are conscious that during their navigation in the Network they are stored with precision the keywords sought, the directions of IP and the pages where passed upon finishing the search. 
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, the users can store its own record of navigation, they can consult again what sought before, what they opened and thanks to this record will generate searches a lot more personalized -in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, in which the system will offer us products and services in base of the previously definite preferences and stored. 
What will occur if they take advantage of my data against my same one, if collect informations on my activities? - They ask those users that worry seeing the informative monopoly of Google. 
In most cases more well the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not the remorse, the fear by the punishment, the yearning by the liberty or the rebellion against the power. 
Nevertheless it is an already confirmed fact that do not only conserve, but in justifiable cases also they yield to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protect the personal rights of the internet users. 
The most it debated example of the last times was perhaps the action coordinated against the Brazilian pedophiles, when Google delivered to the Brazilian government the informations of its page of Web, call Orkut, to identify the pedophiles. 
On the other hand, the internet users that worry about the rights of the people, in the month of May they were alleviated when the company along with the EFF, organization for the defense of the electronic rights, showed successfully before the court that was right in its lawsuit with the FBI: according to the sentence, itself will not be able to oblige Google, by means of none of the points of the constitution to supply any type Of requested information in secret by the FBI. 
(At the same time the federal government managed to obtain I am pretext to reinforce the law of protection of the infancy approved years ago, near fifty thousand directions of Web and some thousand phrases sought, but without obtaining the lists of search of the individual users, neither neither the complete lists of web pages and of keywords of the last two months.) 
Thus it is quite contradictory the opinion on the Google: they criticize it those that fear to supply its personal data because think that their intimacy is damaged, their private life upon beginning to utilize the services of Google, and they rebel against her as against the multinational companies of conservative image. 
In the meantime, the culture geek American and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users of other countries, they see in them the future generation, the "corporation of vanguard", not thus to its rival one, the Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as the conqueror of the World, however much both fight for the same objective. 
This can occur because the Google contrary to the Microsoft, asks of the users no code of identification, neither money by its applications, the code is opened and the package of free program, constantly you bring up to date and seems more youthful, more collaborating than the practice of the official giant of the software. 
But it can be also because the geek see with precision the relation very existing problems between the rights of the people and the Internet that was produced exactly by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2,0. 
The Web 2,0 is a matter of the contribution, to leave deliberate tracks behind us and to take advantage of the channels of available communication, and while the measures of these various individually, the essence continues being the same one: to show us ourselves. 
A normal youth can have profile in numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and even he can unite them with other services, as for example the Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their customs of music, later to these he can include them in a system of monitoring as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can have besides a blog, in which the most recent galleries of photos appear automatically It is stored in the Flickr or in the Picasa. 
We can know numerous cases of the ones that is removed that for example the girlfriend, upon seeing the flow of in the morning following photographs of the common friends, itself entire with who spent the night previous its fraudulent boyfriend or they say good-bye the employee of a company because this writes its sincere opinion in its blog on the direction of the business: a thing is sure, the definition of the Private it was revalued completely. 
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows of itself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of the youth of our days. 
And the one that desires to hide something, or at least intends to avoid the monopoly of Google, can do it (beginning for example with the Scroogle that utilizes the system of search of Google, but does not leave tracks). 
There are many people that do not want to be registered in the collective pages to avoid that they can find them, but the applications can be replaced "on line" of Google, since the texts editing software to the applications of image and reading of news with versions alternatives which they are not connected with gigantic servants neither they prepare the profile more perfect possible on us. 
The public opinion expects almost that openly the day in which the Google show its true face. 
The company with its current value of 156 thousand million dollars is worth more than the IBM (140 thousand million dollars), the Intel (124 thousand million dollars) or the Coca-Cola (110 thousand million dollars), the surfaces of publicity of AdWords/AdSense threaten the incomes of the agencies of publicity, while the services that are introduced each time more quickly they cause serious headaches not only The Microsoft, but also to numerous other businesses desarrolladores of software. 
The critical observers nevertheless, they will find the alarming contradictions also: for example the upper direction rejected flatly the protest of the employees after duplicating the price of the childlike preschool of the business, they considered too much face the unlimited number of diet of the employees, but all this is not swum in comparison with the fact that in the year 2006 the Google yielded before the pressure of the Chinese government And the company according to the agreement filtered every information that violated the good morale and the interests of the Chinese state. 
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will announce no new service with advance, but only when already was ready to function, what if is insurance is that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will be able to revolve to the World: while some they believe that the project of I scan and file of books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the quick company will be It cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, other they fear of their system Health, because in her we can create complete sanitary our own profile, with previous analysis, with ours medical and our problems. 
And the fact that Google be going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good commodity for the science fiction works writers, the Scroogled, novel of the popular one of Cory Doctorow, describes in form orweliana that future, in which a man only of the data of the Google can be described alarmingly well. 
Two under age helped to erase the tracks to the author of the double murder of the city of Ózd. 
The police interrogated to two under age on the double murder of Ózd who, he as suspects supported, they helped to erase the tracks of the crime - the spokesman of the General Precinct of law and order of the province said Tuesday of Borsod.

The Market of Warsaw presented an offering to buy the Market of Prague 
The Stock Exchange of Warsaw offered two hundred million euro - some five billion Czech crowns - by the a hundred percent of the actions of the Stock Exchange of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Stock Exchange of Warsaw confirmed the offering that did the Poles, in spite of the fact that the Czechs previously have excluded to the Market of Warsaw of the possible new owners of the Market of Prague. 
The reason is that the Market of Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
The 99 percent of the actions is in the hands of the Polish State that inside some months desires to sell the 60 percent of the same. 
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offering of the Poles has been the highest one among the ones that were offered for them interested by the Market of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, up to now they gave offering the Market of Vienna, the Transatlantic Market Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of new York, the London stock market and the Deutsche Börse. 
Petr Koblic, the leader of the Stock Exchange of Prague declared last week that among them interested the worst new owner would be the Stock Exchange of Warsaw and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in a future to disappear the Stock Exchange of Prague. 
The experts calculate the value of the Market of Prague in some 5 to 10 billion crowns.

On the financial crisis since the point of view of the European press 
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the increasingly more deep international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 of September". 
The global financial catastrophe himself due to the American president - thinks The Republic of Rome - the president has not been capable not even to obtain the support of his own party for the hasty done government bill, whose objective he is to give him solution to this exasperating situation... 
Instead of a new one "Pearl Habor", of the one that spoke the investor multimillionaire Warren Buffett, is more correct to speak of a "second 11 of September". 
According to a part of the press of Madrid, Washington is the expiatory goat. 
In opinion from The World the error of the political direction of the United States was the one that carried to the world economy to the edge of the abyss. 
Each time grows more the danger of the collapse of the American monetary system and this then, will result in the entire world. 
Although the plan of Bush was not perfect, after the voting of the congress the danger arises that Washington does not offer political instrument to treat to the crisis. 
The world economy is suspended in the air - exactly when is carries out one of the greater transformations of the history of the capitalism one. 
Itself it cannot pay attention omitted to this threat - aims the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states today still can throw him belt of life preserver to the tottering financial institutions, being able to save them thus of the bankruptcy with the money of the taxpayers. 
But if as I dominate they decay them more bank still, then no longer they will be sufficient neither the new funds, neither neither the new improvisations. 
It is needed long-term that the member states of the European Union leave to one side their nationalist selfishness and they centralize the control on the financial markets fragmented. 
The financial institutions in crisis received only Monday more than 100 billion euro - recalls the Viennese one Der Standard, adding that are increasingly more real the worries that, just as did the Americans, also the European taxpayers should pay a lot of money to solve the crisis. 
The EU up to now itself has not been occupied seriously with the crisis that passes as a cúname by the old world. 
The "saviors" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euro, but would be good if to define: In what cases is justified to employ the funds of the taxpayers to avoid a badly greater one? 
The self-intelligent one imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
Which would it be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the sensors of existing obstacles in the nature? 
For example that of the bumblebees. 
In a surprising project presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the bumblebees gave the starting point for the engineers of Nissan to design the following generation of the system of prevention of the collisions. 
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the system of robotic direction of cars type BR23C imitator of the nature, to which the characteristics of the bumblebees they gave him, with the final objective to create a system that can avoid all the collisions. 
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own oval private space that in reality a striking resemblance to our protective capsule of security bears - explained in the exposition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and of development and investigations. 
They play an important role the composed eyes of the bumblebees that are capable of seeing in all the directions in an angle over 300 degrees. 
To copy the function of the composed eyes, the engineers utilized the system of measurement of the length by laser beams. 
This it identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C inside a distance of 2 meters, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a sign to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately is transformed into a maneuver to avoid the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction rotating in the necessary measure the wheels. 
As opposed to any existing system at present, this maneuver is completely instinctive. 
"If it was not thus, the robot of the vehicle would not be able to react with the sufficient rapidity as to avoid the obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the Laboratory of Mobility and of the project of the robot of vehicles. 
It should react immediately and in instinctive form, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable interior layer of the protective capsule of security, in a layer inside which at present inevitable all kinds of collisions are considered. 
All the process should reflect what does a bumblebee to avoid other bumblebees. 
This process should be carried out in a to open and to close the eyes. 
Nevertheless, as opposed to the bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, downward or diagonal, but only can be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of turn of the wheels 
In this manner, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here only they utilized as possibility for the robot of the car the movement newspaper and the acceleration besides the frenaje. 
The BR23C utilizes batteries of lítio-polymer that are lighter and is greater its density of energy, what means that they have a more long duration of life than that of lítio-ión. 
According to Andoh, what is important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the capacity of prosecution of the data, neither much less that of storage. 
This apparatus in each second only should process some signs of entrance and to react according to the case. 
It is not necessary to store these data neither to react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, thus utilizes only some scores of kilobytes by memory. 
Themselves not memories of gigabytes are needed, neither of megabytes. 
This it is the first step to develop the technology for avoid immediately the obstacles, which according to calculations of the Nissan, inside ten years will be able to be incorporated to the models manufactured in series. 
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit to the system of navigation by satellite way GPS to carry the conductor to its destiny, avoiding the existing obstacles in its road. 
Already has name this very expensive boy 
The version written of the law of the package of financial rescue of 700 thousand million dollars has been prepared that will apply in several phases with the purpose to buy the bad credits of the banks. 
In the first phase the half of the money will be spent. 
According to schedule of the oriental coast during the new consultations that lasted until after the midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress arrived at an agreement around the package of financial rescue of 700 thousand million dollars on the whole, after several days of discussion - reported the Reuters. 
We have achieved an important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American Congress, affirming that lacks only to finalize the agreement in a document. 
The commitment assumed on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finances, speaking on the result of the commitment affirmed: this program will function and will be efficient but other measures are needed more. According to Pelosi, does not be a matter of saving to the Wall Street, but of turning over the car of the economy. 
The version written of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is to say Sunday before the 8 at night, according to schedule of Washington (that is to say before the two of the early morning on Monday, according to schedule of Europe Central), without caused a spectacular leap in the markets. 
On the government bill called law of emergency for the economic stabilization of the year 2008, first Monday will vote the American Congress and then the Senate. 
The president George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news on the agreement. 
We are happy with the progress reached during the night and we appreciate highly the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy - declared Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House. 
The program is different from the original proposal of the administration of Bush to spend all the 700 thousand million dollars to buy poor quality proceeds of credit values titles. 
Now only it will be able to spend the half of the 700 thousand million dollars, utilizing 250 billion immediately after the Congress vote, probably Monday, of this sum the Department of Finances will buy proceeds of credit values titles, of bad qualification and the destiny of other 100 thousand million dollars depends on the decision of the president. 
This program will be controlled by a special agency, in which will participate also the president of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 thousand million dollars will be able to be spent after a new decision of the Congress. 
According to the law the Department of Finances can apply a tactic combined: will be able to buy simultaneously bad credits, mortgages and proceeds of credit values titles, besides other credits of type "poisonous" also. 
The purchase will be able to do in auctions or well in direct form - they reported competent people of the department. 
The law permits to the companies affected to participate in a program of insurance where the accounts receivable of finances guarantees the worrying elements, by which they will pay the companies the amount pertaining to the foreseeable damages. 
Henry Paulson affirmed: the law assures of such way the necessary financial media, that until 700 thousand million dollars can arrive even to satisfy the urgent needs of the American financial system, try the purchase of bad financial media, of their aseguramiento or of the prevention of risks that be able to cause the collapse of some large financial institutions. 
We do all that is needed to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - added. 
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks that are in urgencies and they expect the aid of the State they will be able to include the official limitation of their compensations, that the American slang calls simply parachute of gold. 
Only in some specific cases the payments will be limited, besides the limitations depend on the form of aid of the department of finances. 
The limitation signifies that if the department purchase in the framework of an auction, will be imposed a tax extra for the parachute of gold, to be not that the leader failed of the bank retire. 
Upon buying directly the bad credits the government will intervene aggressive to assure that the compensations of the leaders be not exaggerated. 
Besides the previous thing do not be going to change the existing gold parachute contracts, the limitations refer only to the new contracts to stimulate thus also the participation in the program. 
This it is the first case in the American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the incomes of the general directors - commented measured happiness the democratic one Barney Frank, president of the commission of the Congress, responsible by the financial products. 
The State will have besides right to acquire shares of the participating banks in the program, thus the risk of the taxpayers will be reduced, since in final they will be able even to obtain profits with the transaction as soon as recover the economy and with her the bank. 
According to the government bill in the next five years the president should present to the Congress a proposal on the form of how return the taxpayers the losses of the financial sector. 
Of course in both sides there was who they expressed their reserves with regard to the project. 
It is not this what the American citizens they entrusted us, that is to say not the dollars of the taxpayers are being protected - declared the republican congressperson of California, Darrell Issa. 
Their democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur affirmed: the measures pressed it the same that are heads by the collapse of the Wall Street.

Magazine of press of the area of German speech 
The group of right is intact, only that inside the own group the most conscious voters were converted - affirms the Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria. 
Haider and its followers are ready to govern in Austria for impede a coalition rojinegro. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.of) 
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of left Franz Walter, in its titled article "The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents" analyzes the motives of the dramatics defeats of the CSU. 
According to the acquaintance political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had been initiated a lot before the sad duet Beckstein-Huber to have taken on its job. 
The socialcristianos during various decades went developing to Bavaria - and now exactly these modern citizens are the ones that give him the back. 
The change of a was is at the same time a problem of all the Christian democracy, thus also of Angela Merkel. 
The failure was not completely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday a process was finished that was predicted already since almost ten years ago: disappeared the indisputable hegemony of a party of state. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time by underneath 50 percent from the fifties. 
This it was repeated three years ago, in the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, that is to say still during the so mentioned was of Stoiber. 
The reason of it is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its ancestors. 
The sociologists already 40 years ago come foretelling this, but in the rhythm they were mistaken a lot. Nevertheless, the secularization, the results of the education and the settlement of the Germans north in the regions developed of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the voters of the CSU. 
With the modernization enlarge also the possibilities and it likewise has political consequences. 
The group of right is intact, only that inside the own group the more stubborn and more critical, most conscious voters were converted. 
Is surprising that in the last few weeks exactly the conventional groups of the citizens were the ones that moved away more than the CSU; the autonomous, the small industrialists, the ones that have degree and the graduates. 
Thus itself recudió to less than 40 percent the support to the CSU.

Today it has been initiated in Paris the European Summit for the Equality of Opportunities, his host is France that this year is also president of shift of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, representative of the European Popular Party by the Fidesz, in its message directed to the full one, as one of the main speakers of this professional encounter, called the attention about the segregation in the education, because is one of the most serious violations than whip the children gypsies and besides is also the largest obstacle before the predict him foundation of its interests. 
This conference of highly level was inaugurated - in name of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French minister of employment and social matters and by Vladimir Spidla, responsible European commissioner by the jobs, social matters and of equality of opportunities. 
They attended the meeting representatives of the governments, European social speakers and representatives of the most important European organizations of protection of the social rights. 
Járóka - according to the bureau of press of the group of representatives of the Fidesz in the European Parliament - notified that besides the discrimination in the employment, the gypsies remain out of the labor market in the first place by their low level of education. 
"Most of the young gypsies they have not finished the average teaching and due to the poor quality of the basic teaching, only an insignificant part can obtain university diploma". 
Járóka emphasized besides that the education, as fundamental human right, has a determinant role in the predict him foundation of the other human rights also. 
The investment in the teaching of the children gypsies to an early age can fortify the economy of the member States of the European Union. 
According to the Eurodeputy, is necessary to make aware extensively these so much questions among the gypsies as among the not gypsies. 
Therefore while earlier comience the school a student gypsy, more possibilities will have to be become a member active of the labor market; through the taxes to the income and of consumption they will also contribute to the national budget. 
"To the gypsies, like the citizens of the European Union, one must assure them the right for an education of quality and to guarantee the abolition of the education segregated and of low level" - emphasized Lívia Járóka.

CSU: grace for a transitory period 
To the end of October a decision on the luck will make of the failed duet Huber-Beckstein 
In spite of the serious electoral rout, not yet heads in the tops of the CSU have been cut Bavarian, for the moment the debate on personal questions has been deferred. 
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still they remain in its positions, but itself is not known to when the grace will last. 
The luck of the duet, that suffered a disastrous electoral rout of 17 percent, will be decided in the extraordinary congress of the party that the last weekend of October will be celebrated. 
The members of the so criticized duet left to make out: themselves they are not grasped so much to their positions. 
With it they intended to calm down to the furious members of their parliamentary group and of their organization of base, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" they required personal consequences due to the loss of the simple majority. 
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber that was in the top of its career - the union socialcristiana reached 60.7 percent, on the other hand now, a year after the crammed blow against Stoiber, obtained only 43.4 percent. 
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives the 18 percent of the PBI German. 
Although in the Southern province, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, the conservatives continue dominating, in the future without doubt they should do coalition with someone. 
As first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice president Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of the possible successors of Huber, has also a position in the reduced group of intelligence that initiates negotiations with the FDP liberal and with the Voters Free of right on a possible governmental coalition in Munich. 
The strange thing of the destiny is that in the list of the Voters Free enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken advantage of for the blow of the duet Huber-Beckstein and then they erased cruelly of the setting to the ambitious local politics. 
The top leaders of the CSU are investing now all its energies to stabilize to Beckstein. 
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also that up to now was moving the cords in the fund, the former-leader of old and provincial government president of the CSU qualified September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career. 
Monday Huber did some critical observations to the CDU, in their opinion they had deserved a lot more support of the party brother. 
Other politicians of the CSU interpreted the rout as a warning for the CDU and for the own one Angela Merkel also. 
After the elections of September from 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor if they are not capable of highlighting next to the CSU that played a transcendental role in the successes of the national elections of 2005. 
According to Merkel that with great difficulty could hide their deception by the failure, the losses of the CSU will not result negatively on the great coalition of berlin. 
Which naturally is relative: will not be easier to treat to the CSU injured and the crisis of the continuous social democrats. 
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worse result since 1946 in Bavaria. 
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0 
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposing representative in the Belorussian parliament. 
According to the Russian observers, this is explained with the welfare and the stability that guarantees in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, on the other hand according to the Organization for the Security and the Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained more well with the violations of the committed law during the count of the votes. 
The OSCE that sent 450 observers originating in 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral result. 
Though the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, comprising hundred and ten representatives, does more than one decade does not have opposition, before the elections from yesterday the united opposition under the name of Democratic Forces you United (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, that for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the elections of 2006 of doubtful legitimacy, by consequence of the modification of the Constitution this time "would permit" The entrance of some representatives of the opposition in the parliament. 
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that originally wanted to do. 
In the fund of the expectations of the opposition was the one that Belarus, that each time depends more economically of Russia - that took a credit to moderate the importing of natural gas each time more face of Russia and that contributed for sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes for the country - desired to improve its relations with the European Union, that him not permission gives Of entrance to Lukashenko and to the others political of highly level by having a political state considered antidemocrático. 
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, upon evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis more well on the positive phenomena and not on the errors - as for example the prohibition of participating tax to a third of the candidates of the opposition. 
Nevertheless the primary report on Monday of the OSCE criticized even the own campaign - in which the candidates of the opposition could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition did not be able been present in the count of the votes. 
With all this in opinion of the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: remained at liberty the political prisoners and Minsk is willing a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of Osetia Southern and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal State - already a month ago that considers the two regions as independent. 
- We have given two steps forward and one backwards, but it more important is that the dialogue between Belarus has been initiated and the European Union - declared to our periodic one Alexandr Milinkevich. 
According to the candidate of the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006 is desirable to maintain this situation, in spite of the fact that "the state fears to permit the entrance of so even an opponent in that parliament without weight". 
The opposition does not plan to organize demonstrations upon seeing the results, more well tries to cause to arrive at the voters its message on the need to do you reform economic. 
- This clear it causes us many problems because we should print the press of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but even thus I see that each time are more the ones that support the change among the of legal age also - said Milinkevich, doing allusion to that to the state of Lukashenko, that believes that their main result is the creation of the social security, it do not they consider Adequate not even them they retired, the ones that officially are the most subsidized by the state. 
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the trade deficit, is only question from time the disorder of the social security that "seems to the silence of the cemeteries" - thought Milinkevich. 
The Russian observers contrary to the politician of the opposition qualified as democratic to the elections. 
Serguei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Community of Independent States declared to the Russian agency of news he Laugh Novosti: "The people does not believe in the words but in the facts", so that the lack of the opposition is not another thing that the testimony of the maturity of the Belorussian voters. 
Brunetta: "Of now in more has breakfast before beginning to work" 
It has not happened never in the History of Palace Chigi that put automatic doors to control the entrance and the exit of the personnel. 
But from now on it is initiated with this measure against who puts on file and later goes to the bar to take a coffee in working hours. 
This news has been presented today by the minister of the Administration Publishes, Renato Brunetta and by the secretary general of the presidency of the Counsel, Mauro Masi.

This is Reformism", underlines of NEW Brunetta. 
With Palace Chigi itself complete the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Counsel. 
For Masi "the election of the automatic doors is important also since the symbolic point of view". 
Itself not resistance on the part of the employees has been found, assures the secretary general: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was the contribution on behalf of the same". 
In final, not more breakfast in working hours; not more coffee and crescents. 
Word of Brunetta, that suggests, smiling, "a good Capuchin at 7 in the morning is a holy hand". 
During a convention in the Upper school of the Public Administration 
Of Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences by illnesses of the civil servants have been reduced of the 50%, means 60 thousand people more at work in a year". 
And it adds that is necessary to yield more efficient the Public Administration 
Italian, "which dynamic salary – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well by above the I limit of inflation". 
For now millions of civil servants have been united to be opposed to the norms of the decree Brunetta adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons. 
"While the minister of the civil service shows the numbers, the smaller one ausentismo of work because of illness – he writes the association of consumadores – the town of the 'industrious vague' is in continuous increase. 
They are millions really in Italy the employees of the correct public administration and productive that have been united to declare war to the norms you illegalize of the decree". 
Particularly, in the Tar the exclusion of economic processing was answered aggregates by illness owed on account of service; the extension of the hourly girdles in which the visits of medical control of the sick employee are carried out, and other contained aspects in the new beloved dispositions by the minister. 
Industrial accidents, Neapolitan: "Crucial prevention" 
Each day, in Italy, they are verified in the work 2,500 accidents, 3 people die and 27 they remain permanently invalid. 
For the 2007, the data Inail confirm really that the white deaths have been approximately 1,200. 
Figures that testify the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost the double one of dead persons with respect to the homicides. 
To call the attention of the institutions, social forces and media of information on this dramatics question, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces from Italy the 58° national day by the victims of the industrial accidents, institutionalized in the second Sunday of October. 
"The worrying data diffused by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm as much as crucial be the question of the prevention in the work", affirms the president of the Republic Giorgio Neapolitan, in the sent message to the president of the Anmil, national Association mutilated and invalids by the work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The leader of the State squeezes his "great appreciation by the constant associative pledge in favor of the prevention in the place of work, of the protection of the workers injured, of the assistance to the families of the victims and of the sensitizing of the public opinion". 
"It has been declared, a 'suffices', sincerely shared, in front to tragedies that, by its dimensions, they stir up the clamor of the media and the participation of the public opinion, on the other hand the routine reality proposes us even repeated, dramatic cases in its dynamics". 
Neapolitan does not it hide that "there are without doubts a problem of resources: is decisive to invest in formation and in information. 
Signified individual take the numerous initiatives promoted in school environment for one more direct takes of conscience on behalf of the youths that enter the working world. 
It is a should maintain alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to brake the alarm on the social gravity, to apply and to improve the legislative norms. 
In turn the president of the Camera Gianfranco Fini has underlined "as the phenomenon of the white deaths they constitute an absolute social emergency, that offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all the institutions a determined pledge to put urgently end". 
"The data on the accidents in the work seem to indicate a light one andamiento positive, but this does not remove that the number of the white deaths be likewise impressive", has rebranded the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"Do not we want, really, that this" tendency to the decrease" be translated in less attention, because is exactly when the attention diminishes that exploits the tragedy. 
"We believe that to general level be done still too much little to contrast the phenomenon of the accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions. 
They are necessary, to our criterion - stands out Mercandelli – greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the formation of the workers, and this from the world of the school ". 
"It serves a subsequent effort - has aggregated - inasmuch as concerns the communication and the sensitizing of the public opinion. 
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on behalf of the employers with respect to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency". 
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of predicted subsidiary guardianship for the victims of the work" and the "welfare derivation toward which the system is being directed in recent years". 
"The objective is to return the worker the guarantee of the insurance - has aggregated – because the luck of whom an accident has have not that to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator each time". 
Readers Mp3 low accuses, they put to risk the hearing 
Listening music to high volume by a period long portable musical time utilizing apparatuses as the readers Mp3 can cause permanent wounds to the hearing. 
It is as much as refers the European Commission, that in a communiqué diffused in Bruxel appointment the opinion of the Scientific Commission of the emerging sanitary risk and recently identifying (Csrseri) of the Eu, published today. 
"Of this scientific opinion – reads in the note – arises that the 5-10% of those that, by a period of at least 5 years, they listen music with portable musical apparatuses weekly for more than an hour to the day having the apparatus to high volume they risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity". 
"The fact worries me that a thus high number of youths that utilize frequently portable musical apparatuses and cell phones to high acoustic level can ruin unconsciously its ears in hopeless way", affirms Meglena Kuneva. 
"Of the scientific proofs – continues the responsibility Eu - emerges a clear risk and we should react quickly. 
What counts, is to sensitize to the consumadores and to yield this public knowledge information. 
We owe re to examine, besides the systems of existing control in light of this scientific opinion, so that they be extensively efficient and they have the step with the new technology". 
Bruxel had asked To The Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical apparatuses and the increase of the number of youths exposed to the noise that that originates. 
"The scientists - concludes the executive Eu – they confirm that is cause for concern and the European Commission now will examine along with to the member states and to the parts interested that measures would be able eventually to adopt to protect better the children and the adolescents of the exposition to the noise originating from portable musical apparatuses and related apparatuses". 
At present, a European safety regulation exists already that limits to 100 dB the level of noise of the portable musical apparatuses, but worry enlarges as the auditory damage that can derive from an excessive exposition to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit of a lot these damages traveling through to solutions as the reduction of levels and of the time of exposition to the noise. 
In its opinion, The Committee Scientific Eu does present that themselves the utilizadores of portable musical apparatuses listen to high volume (but of 89 decibels) music by alone 5 hours to the week they surpass the limit at present in vigor relating to the maximum noise consented to the job. 
Those that listen music in such conditions for periods but prolonged, they risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity after a period of 5 years. 
It signifies that affects the 5-10% of the utilizadores of such apparatuses and the I number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu. 
Rome, Alemanno gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital 
Today it is initiated, in March closes, in June the accounts will be done. 
It is this the calendar set by the city Hall and for the workers of the "Commission for the fututo of the capital of Rome", that this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas has been established of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission deliberated the main points for Rome. 
Once they closed the doors in March, the meeting and the communal counsel evaluated analysis and projects, in way to present in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bun" of the city Hall and of their manager Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the cultural, social, and political ideas – tends to underline Alemanno – should provide proposals for the development of Rome in which the ones that decide politically, the meeting and the town council, they will be able later to be vouched for. 
There is not any roles position excess, alone the will to have a place where to devise a great project for Rome. 
In March finished the works will disappear, because this experience should have a finish temporary I need. 
In June – announces the manager – we will present the strategic plan utilizing the work fact of the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome". 
To whom accuses the Commission of useless, given that its reports are not binding, Alemanno responds: "All depends on the work that will be in degree to carry out the Commission and of the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as also I am sure in Rome, its contribute will be fundamental. 
Almost always the politics is crushed in the ordinary management and in emergencies that of return in return they are declared.. 
We, to the contrary, we want to look at but there and long-term, in a prospective but deep, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and to its future". 
The manager of Rome tends to indicate besides that "this Commission is not neither an useless entity neither a banality: is absolutely free, not side a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to cause to participate and to reason the better minds than squeezes the capital". 
For Alemanno, really, "is needed to have a strategic design as reference, done not close neither motionless, to permit to our city to do an I authenticate leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unit spirit to his future". 
A future that, I need the manager of Rome" was not limited alone to the current communal confines but looked at but there" not alone in the viewpoint of the future metropolitan city and of its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome is able and should unfold as Capital of Europe and of the Mediterranean". 
Obama? The first president anti American. 
It has written an I note American politician that interests him to pass for independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first one was Jimmy Carter, that with his decisions reduced the economy USES and pipe relations (as does also today gives private citizen) with the enemy one Islam". 
They enlarge the attacks against Obama while themselves about the date of the elections. 
Has written a lady of Miami in a Web: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama has a great face of stone: believes that won the charge but highly of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!". 
In reality they are attacks that do not say a lot; are attacks clearly of racial nature and do not they respond to the question of the voters: Will be a good president? And besides they are the polls; all say that Obama won and with a good advantage. 
Also in this case exists who speaks with the heart but not with the brain. 
A newspaper of the Misisipi, in the southern bowels of the United States, has written an editorial one: once in the cabin to vote we will know well to whom will give its vote the American patriot. 
A side of the American mentality leaves had cover to the last one. 
"They say what quieran, we will think we later where to put the cross, if on Obama or on McCain". 
There is people that swears: if comes win Obama, we will go of America. 
Things never happinesses before now, that almost certain the success of the black candidate seems. 
Nevertheless in spite of, all these reasoning, the conquering weapon for the democratic is George Bush. 
They have asked 1500 people: Which have been the committed errors by Bush during its mandate? The 89 percent has answered: Iraq. 
Changes America. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and they sent it home to kicks in the rear one. 
In Iraq they are 4500 the soldiers that have lost the life and the Americans they have not been forced to do the valises. 
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been the weak point of Bush. 
Who will assume the position of George W will have an enormous duty that to unfold. 
It uses, the economic collapse causes feels also for the journalists: in the newspapers is time of courts. Many give the fault to Internet, "murderous" of the printed role. 
Five hundred American journalists have been quizzed for PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and of mental control for the future. 
Though, today the journalists are almost all pessimists on their future. 
Nevertheless, the journalists have not declared openly to be felt less worried on the credibility. 
Themselves do not they feel remote as once. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money, the money. 
The crisis of the 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
Besides the courts performed in the room where the writers work to carry out the newspaper, is a great problem. 
It is a problem that should be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if itself is not wanted that the traditional journalism as understands it the majority of the public be reduced substantially. 
A space but complex pessimism dominates today on the American journalist. 
Six on ten journalists and executives are convinced that the journalism to national level this continuing a wrong way. 
In the country localities the executive group is the 65%. 
Printed against emission. 
It is not difficult for the journalists to see where goes the web. 
The greater publishing houses drive themselves a wedge on the Internet, for many view as the "murderous" of the printed letter. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists notify has enlarged to a 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope "that do something of good" by the journalism. 
The break but large today in the American journalism is among who directs the newspapers – that is to say the directors – and the journalists that work for them. 
The 56% of the executives to national level is sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drop to the 23%. 
For some this has to do with the "security of the work". 
The executives that think to lose the job in 3 years are the 47% to national level. 
For the journalistic credits is of the 30%. 
It of the "sure work" to level credits (our writers, ndr) in America is always to the order of business. 
Only the 13% of the journalists they work with a contract. 
In an immense nation as the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet the employers often offer what want and is converted thus in a question of "you take it or leave it",. 
The directors receive almost always good salaries, while the writers can win until 10 thousand dollars monthly, but the retirement and the aseguración social. 
For the holidays, the reasoning is done complicated: a total during the day the first year, another after the third to arrive at 15 complete days after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists, by admission theirs, themselves "they make ill" followed during the year. 
Is all a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmel Rinaudo, has determined to reject the instance of the real estate one Danilo Coppola that had asked to be able to be moved from its city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola this investigated by bankruptcy in the environment of the investigation on the against pact relating to the escalation Unipol-Bnl. 
In the course of the process of arrest to its charge, last week, has obtained the home liberation, transforming into obligatory residence to Grottaferrata. 
Its lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, they had asked that the real estate one can travel through the route of the city of the province to a room of the capital. 
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm has given contrary vote) they would permit to influence their company and to agree to the tests that accuse it. 
The elites in danger 
The phenomenon itself already had declared some days behind with the vote of the camera of the representatives against the plan of salvation of 700 million dollars placed in motion by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, but interested to punish Wall Street that to save the economy. 
It gives us a confirms the New York Times of yesterday reporting us that the crisis under way is disarming the Republican party, always but divided among its old soul of the Coast This, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile to" those of Washington" and to the world of the finances, strong above all in the states of the Center and. 
The soul, in fact, that has been converted high-handed with the vote of whom spoke at the beginning. 
This barely it cited is alone an example of the mutations, of the large mutations, that the economic earthquake under way announces: not alone in the United States but in all the West and not alone here only. 
Be in the United States as in Europe since time ago the crisis seems to function like incubation phenomena accelerator that with the new climate they solidify and they leave to the light. 
The first one of these phenomena is the re updating, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty relating to a type of re nationalization of the economy. 
The crisis, really, is a crisis of banking institutions- would finance which they have, if, strong relations you would finance with the outside, but above all they are compromised a lot more the balances of the families that live in an only country and in an only state. 
The one that creates immediately a political problem for whom it governs: that is to say how to respond to the difficulty and to the protests of those people and of those families that, on the other hand are voters. 
The crisis appears economically world but is politically and exclusively national. 
The political internationalism seems substantially away or they do not have a lot to say: the crucial test is The European Union that divided as usual between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach to decide none political in common. 
It is of the government of each state that all are expected an intervention, plans of rescue and of reactivation, of new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: since the moment that arrives at the cut is alone the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources to finance you to remedy the things. 
And they possess also the necessary media and the recognition to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and any organization will be able never to arrange in the same measure. 
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect tuning, with the greater importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute him to a factor very united to that element: the territoriality. 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced of to have entered the network of the technology always but sophisticated, of the ethereal one, while we were convinced that the global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we gave us account that our future will have on the other hand that to do the accounts each time but with the ethereal little things as the water, the cultivations and the petroleum. 
All things that, you set you, certainly they can be transported from a place to the other of the land but they are likewise united in absolute way in a space circumscribed, a territory. 
So who is found like the sovereign, possesses certainly many but letters with respect to who is not it, and to whom has the misfortune to live in a position without cultivations, without petroleum and without water. 
I arrive at the second news that but foretells a fracture. 
Who Territory says, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership. 
In this sense the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena. 
On the one hand the objective conscience of the need of a leadership, the petition of some that know to take in hand the situation. 
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of economic species relieved inadequate with many dark zones. 
And together something but deep and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, that tends to imply the entire leading class of the countries of the West in a growing number. 
It seems to advance always more, in diverse places of the population, the conviction that before that its actions be the same that those of the social elites up to now in boom, the same way to feel and to be, its culture in the comprehensive exception of the finish, to to have done the own time and to be but strange to the opinions of the majority. 
The demand of leadership, in few words, feeds subterranean a movement ramified but powerful of deslegitimación of the leading classes and of the traditional political structures, that are declared in a" disturbance" electoral or in the sudden changes of collective humors of these last times, since the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the congress Also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something that to see). 
It has the impression that the traditional elites, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, its newspapers, its reputable intellectuals, its format would say some, they do always more difficulty to understand and then to represent, that that from now on that is taking form are the deep strata of the western company and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially in excessive. 
Forward to all this to speak of a" rebellion of masses" nowadays frankly is exagerrateded. 
But to have the open eyes certainly it is not. 
The super adhesive to walk on the walls 
Conquering the laws seriously thanks to a super adhesive and in a future to walk on the walls as the man spider. 
Is the objective of various centers of American investigation and now a team of four institutes has approached enough. 
With an adhesive of alone 2.5 centimeters square the scientists have been able to have hit a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
THE STUDY – The magazine American Science has published the discoveries of some investigators of the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and of the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of investigators is an evolution of the existing that use a private structure of the carbon, call nanotubos of carbon. 
"The principle of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of orderly pipes like a battery of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta. 
The scientists have been inspired to the leg of the geckos, covered of microscopic hairs that can assure to the animal a perfect adhesion. 
The done test on different materials, like the glass, teflon and sandpaper, they have shown that the new adhesive is ten times but powerful of the legs of this reptile and at the same time" separates easily of the walls" explains Liming Dai, investigator of it authorizes of Engineering of the University of Dayton. 
WALKING FOR THE WALLS? - "This material could be useful like transitory adhesive" adds Liming Dai. 
Layers to walk for the walls exactly as the man spider? Layers yes, but the investigators think to a fascinating much less use as the connection among electronic apparatuses, because the nanotubos of carbon are conductors of heat and of electric current. 
Other applications would be able to have to that to see with the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment nothing of superheroes. 
ANOTHER INVESTIGACION - Also the University of Berkeley, in California, is being dedicated to the search of a new adhesive. 
In an article of the American magazine Chemical Society, the Californian scholars have presented a done adhesive of microcomputer fibers as hairs that themselves car clean of the dust during the movement on a surface to maintain always a perfect adhesion. 
Medicines: never with juice of fruit 
Attention to the juice of grapefruit, to that of orange and to that of apple. 
These beverages, consummate above all in summer because are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if they are taken contemporarily with some medicines its absorption is altered amplifying or diminishing according to the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for the health. 
To repeat the risk of the juices of fruits they are bottled that fresh associates to the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, that since the 236esimo meeting national of American Chemical Society under way to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: suffices a grapefruit juice glass, of orange and of apple to reduce the absorbimiento of some medicines, annulling the beneficial effects And putting to risk the health of the patients. 
The juice of grapefruit already was been low accuses because was retained responsible for enlarging to toxic levels some medicinal anti arrítmicos, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamínicos and neurological. 
FARMACOS TO RISKS – The same Italian agency of the medicine had given the news in a bulletin of informations two years ago alarming doctors and patients to underestimate not the danger that derived from this mixture and to put attention to thing is drunk in the case is being assumed a medicine as for example the to Diasepam or the Metadone. 
NOT ALONE THE GRAPEFRUIT – according to the experts also the juice of orange and that of apple contain substances that inhibit the medicines. 
A long list of the principles assets inhibited by the grapefruit and other juices. 
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of farmacología of the state University of Kite:" These discoveries in general comes indicated to the several agencies of the national and international medicine that eventually they provide to change the press releases of the same one. 
Therefore one must read always the illustrative pamphlets of the medicinal that are assumed and if there is something that us does not remain clearly, not to leave us to impress, to ask clearly the doctor or to the pharmacist" underlined the expert of the agency Ansa. 
The New one of economy to Paul Krugman 
The Nobel prize of economy has been assigned to the American one Paul Krugman by its studies, its models of commerce and on the locating of the economic activities. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a Keynesian neon that teaches to the University of Princeton and is an I note editorialist of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the greater critics of the decisions of the administration of Bush as for the economy and to the foreign policy. 
Few months after the attack of September 11, 2001, in those days che broke Enron, Krugman had predicted in an editorial one published by the New York Times that the second serious but determinant event that the first one, in finish of consequence for the United States. 
A forecast that unchain a lot of polemics and that by various years came reproached to the economy, but that now has been revealed exact. 
"I am surprised and a little uncomfortable by as the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and of Worldcom they have disappeared quickly of the attention of the public", had declared Krugman to the fine of the 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive board of the European central banking, Krugman is a" economist of great value", but also a divulgador with a style" very aggressive, particularly critic against the excesses of the liberalism of the administration of Bush". 
Bid for Office, echo the third edition of the package" anti-Microsoft" 
It is the day of the launch of the OpenOffice.org 3,0, the suite they bid for source of personal productivity that looks to attract always but utilizadores, since the house to the office to the professionals of the public administration, as free alternative to the acquaintance Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost a year on behalf of the desarrolladores voluntary, of which its backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, the new one they Bid for Office is shown to the public with several news: to the screen of welcome and to the interface magazine less gross, they are added other but consistent, like the compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac YOU X and the backup for the new format Document Format) 1.2,la finalizes standard version ISO. 
Attention put also to the multi operation with the suite Office 2007, they Bid for Office is in degree to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx,. xlsx,. pptx). 
Interesting some functions you specify of some modules as that that permits to reduce the dimension of the presentation of PowerPoint, useful for example, to send it way electronic pellet, or the possibility to import the file PDF in the I modulate of elaboration grafica, conserving the original aspect of it paginates. 
Always on this front documents can be created "PDF hybrid", that accumulate the grafica typical of the format of Adobe with the elements of a spreadsheet or of a manufacturer of text. 
The Contribution is an element that has received different improvements in the interior of the application: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in diverse users, avoiding the conflicts of them you modify, in the elaboration of texts, to each collaborator comes given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the phase of review. 
Some businesses are also working to carry some functions of OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the next weeks they should give the final result. 
The version in Italian can be dischargeed in the direction http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and I am added to the English that was found in the mirror since Friday. 
Besides that for Windows and Mac YOU, as normally the suite is also available for the operating system Linux. 
To order can be sent also the cd of installation home or at work. 
And if the theme of the free one can be a hook for the diffusion in the houses, is in environment business that Bid for Office the suite tests, tries the large bet, being able already to include various projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools. 
And do not they lack not even the realities that offer a service of formation, consultations and of ideal assistance for the small and medium businesses, in which they would be able to open prospective of business. 
Bid for Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding one of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that substitutes Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the acquaintance Access is the program that consents to work in the dates base; and by I finalize Draw the I modulate grafico. 
Objective for the 2008 is to arrive at 5 million download, and considering that until today we arrive at almost already 3 million 600 thousand, with the exit of the new version is probable that the predicted figure can be surpassed. 
Also Kohl turns out to be positive is the fourth case of doping 
New positive case in the tour of France: is a matter of the Austrian one Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third classified and winner of the best oarswoman of the climber. 
To give the news is the place of the periodic one L' Equip. 
Kohl, 26 years is the positive running room to the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German one Stefan Schumacher, also they of the Gerolsteiner. 
The analyses of the Kohl blood champions enter among those performed in the last few weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against tests they confirm that is positive, the Austrian one will lose the third position to the Tour and ira against the two years of canonical condemnation. 
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the Epo of third generation is the leader of the drug French agency, Pierre Bordry, that has declared to the Associated Press of to have notified the news to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian one of 26 years has been positioned in the podium to the backs of Spanish Carlos Tailor and of the American one Cadel Evans, being judged the oarswoman of the best climber. 
IMMIGRANT: NEW YORK TIMES is ASKED, ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italy of country of emigrant has been transformed alone recently in a privileged destination for the immigrants" received with hostility. 
This is transforming the beautiful country in a nation of racists? It is what the New is asked York Times in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the fear racism in Italy leaving from the case of the young one Abdul William Guibre native of Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan by to have stolen a box of galletitas. 
This case evidence what the New York Times defines the "north paradox" : the northern regions are at the same time those where they are registered "but integration and but work" but also the but highly anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the I bear but highly of the North league". 
As it confirms of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants the New York Times has cited also the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not alone. 
Also the new legislation wanted by the lay sister presses the brake on the immigration and facilitates the expulsion of the secret is cited as paradigm of the cambiamiento of the climate in Italy. 
Tendency marked be for the Pope that by the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Neapolitan finding to Benedetto XVI in the Congress has asked that the State and the church they work together to fight the racism". 
Students you kill of the expensive rent, to 900 euro by a room 
The market of the rents for the university students does not know the crisis. 
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the union of the boarders, to rent a single room I could cost a student 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoles, 600 to Rome. 
"The phenomenon has assumed already very serious characteristics to the extent of excluding the right to study to a great part of youths by the highest costs that the family would have that to maintain – he explains the responsible for the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand completely has deformed the market to such extent of unchaining a process of increase generalized even for the residents". 
To part that in most cases the offerings of rents contain a series of violations: contracts type free, unregistered, unlimited of canon, sub rents linked. 
For Sunia they are necessary extraordinary interventions that, through the review of the fiscal imposition, the prices can be regulated. 
Looking at in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, by a bed in zone Brianza, serve approximately 450 euro; by a single room since a minimum of 650 (zone Bande Nere) to a medium value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and wild Animal) to a maximum of 900 (in zone Victory). 
In Florence a bed costs in average of 350/400 euro, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where the students concentrate on the zones near the University, they serve 250/280 euro by a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 by an individual one. 
In Rome in the central zones near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) 600 euro by a single room ask you approximately and 450 by a bed in a double room. 
Alone values slightly but low (550 euro by a single room) in zones near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
Economy is done only if changes peripheral area: 300 euro by a bed and 450 by a single room in zone Prenestina, Centocelle and outskirts. 
In Naples by a bed they serve you 300/450 euro, by a room is spent since 400 to 600 euro, with the prices but highly in the zones Hospital, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari by a bed they serve you 250/350 euro, at least 350 by an individual one. 
In the cities but small the prices are but low in finish absolute, but has a greater weight in the economy of the city. 
In the cities as in Perugia, where the phenomenon of the rents to students and non-EU is but frequent, a subsequent anomaly is registered: an increase from the 25/30% of the canon to the foreign students with respect to the Italians. 
Good-bye to the old movies Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic rooms 
The historic film rooms close favoring the Multiplex. 
"A city without film rooms in a blind city, is like a face without eyes". 
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with efficiently what is happening in the large Italian cities and also in the cities of province. 
The process of marginalization of the movies, that with the birth of the large busybodies in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the cute rooms in the central zones of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime. 
To disappear almost are always full, historic places by memory," is as if to die a friend, an acquaintance with which a piece of place was shared and so much emotion", Observes the director of the new movies Paradiso, the movie that twenty years ago behind win the prime one Oscar and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, that counted the poetry of a movie theater of province and the nostalgia To live the movies that lost perhaps for always. 
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of the merchants, they speak frankly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional movies, and to pay the majority they are sobretodos the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions but suffered by the closings they are as first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 movies less, continuing for Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
It is a demonstration that the responsible for their disappearance is the agreement of the multiplex, they are own these three Italian regions that have done to register the major number meddling of new movies: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 be in Tuscany that in Emilia-Romaña. 
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," would be useful that be to built new structures but would be needed to guarantee the continuance of those already existing, because when a room of city closes, not all their frequenters are willing to be transfered the busybodies. 
By speak not of the lack of funds in favor of the merchants: the previous debt of the state is of approximately 10 million euro. 
It is shameful since the moral and ethical point of view, that the government respect not the laws that exist. 
To maintain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euro to the year". 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closings, decided to be repaired with the firm of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first one of this type in Italy to promote and to protect the movies cute room be in the historic center that in the periphery. 
Among the norms predicted they exist mediated of fiscal facilitation in favor of the agents and advantages for the public in finish of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter the zone of trafico limited and they will have special rates for the parking. 
"It is an initiative that i like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I expect that other cities continue the example of Bologna putting standing other measures. 
It is certain, that for contrasts the extra to be able of the busybodies, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and of the image because the public today is but exacting. 
The defense of the traditional movies is a theme that for was always important: the closing of the movies of Bagheria, the place of my infancy and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to carry out the "New movies Paradiso", that already thought since 10 years ago. 
I live in Rome since 25 years ago, and when step in front to the Rialto or to the Quirinale of way Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many emotions shared, for see not the placards blackened by the dust, I turn for the other side". 
Tie between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Taurus 
"The mayor of Gioia Taurus was available to standardized the elections of the Municipality for him interested to the cosca Piromalli". 
They are heavy you accuse them that the judges of the Direction antimafia of Calabria give the manager and to the vice manager of Goia Taurus Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosary Schiavone, and to the manager of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association. 
It arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and its grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already condemned by mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euro. 
"Despising any moral and legal norm, and of good sense", they write the proxies, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to the lawyer Piromalli. 
"Would have been permitted the mafia family – they write the judges- to enter officially to the internal one of the municipality facilitating the great possibility of the control and of command of the public administration". 
The president of the regional meeting calabrés Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements among the bad life organized there is a pile" in his region: "There are zones where the mafia intensity is but hardly that in other, where the agreement is almost inevitable. 
But there is so many local politicians that resist to the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes that is maintained clean ". 
Them they arrested of this morning they are added to those of the past July after the police had announced the cut of heads of the mafia family Piromalli. 
Since the end of the past April, the town council of Gioia Taurus there was themselves disuelto, already in 1991 and always by presumed condicionamientos among the criminality organized and the local administration, the local politicians had been solevados of the assignment to administer the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, manager, of the Udc to the moment of the dissolution, after the balloting to May of the 2006, had been chosen like the leader of a coalition of right center. 
I exploit a scandal when the Prefectura I order the dissolution of the town council. 
I call in cause to the vice home secretary that in that epoch was Framework Minniti, accusing of to have organized all by a political question, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli until had come the variation of the project of the highway ask A3. 
Of the stoppages you set them facts to Dal Torrione, they write the judges, emerges "the availability to favor the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very close to the clan Piromalli, standardized the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families". 
When the energy is born of the waves, they descend to the setting the large 
It is a deposit exterminated that occupies but from the 70% of the surface of the planet and they are discovering it now, the large world companies of the energy. 
Waves, current, tides are the new renewable sources on which look at the large as Chevron. 
The possibility to collect energy of the movements of the sea is studied since a hundred years ago and in the years 70 along with the first petroleum crisis, the investigations intensified. 
When the price of the low petroleum, in 1980, the idea to take advantage of the marine energy was separated, but now that the cases of environment and the new increase of the petroleum give impulse to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has reckoned for the 2007 that the 15 percent of the world electric need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea. 
This quantity would be the double one of it produced at present by the nuclear power plants. 
And besides would be the currents and the tides. 
Giants to the attack. 
The first business to wager on the marine energy has been Enersis, that the 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the north of Portugal. 
When the intention was announced seemed a revolutionary step. 
To two years of distance to wager on the marine energy they are always but and among these businesses the ones that have voted always by the traditional energy. 
"Chevron is studying the technology on the oceanic energy – has declared the spokesman of an associated business upon having the American oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us". 
The cooperation in question is on the obtaining of a permission of the commission for the American energy, to carry out a project for exploit the marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a quite important sign, if is considered that in Alaska the US they continue to extract petroleum and recently the president Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drillings. 
Besides Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Sweater to continue the road of the energy that comes from the sea, the total invested up to now, although they are not detailed they indicate an interest in increase. 
Technology to develop. 
The experts speak of a technology still to the start, because the marine energy there is not you doubt that has a great environmental impact. 
For now the impacts as those Portuguese or the Scotch are of small dimension and they do not seem to create large problems to the ecosystem. 
To produce energy to long scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact should be used. 
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of united boas among them. 
The force of the waves, that causes moves the boas up and downward becomes pressure hydraulics with pistons and cylinders to the internal one of the same. 
The pressure causes rotates a turbine that at the same time feeds a generator. 
The electricity is sent to the coast through underwater cables. 
For now they are four the implants of this developing type, to the alone wait of the federal approval, to part of the energy, would be able to serve to for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the other hand, produces already energy for a shopping center and for a parking, using underwater turbines in the East River of New York. 
The movement of the water when there are tides, causes rotates the palettes of the turbines, creating a revolving movement that feeds the generator. 
Verdant has said that has a long team of clients to the wait of the necessary authorizations to utilize the energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
A private interest, they say in the Institute for the development of the electric power, merita at this time the potential of the tides. 
Though be a matter of an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are but prevenibles that the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore but dependable as source of energy. 
It is above all on the energy of the tides that states as New York, Maine and Alaska, next to other that approach the coasts, they have invested 7 million and middle of dollars in the 2008 and is predicted an investment of 35 million for the 2009.
