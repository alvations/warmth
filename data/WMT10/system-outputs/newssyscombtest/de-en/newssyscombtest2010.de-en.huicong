In the mountains schneemangel hotel owners bedeviled
Scneelose pisten sorgenn make not only the riesengebirgen-anwohnern .
The lack of snow deterred by the people of appointment of the skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions .
It is therefore in riesengebirge still free room for all wintertermine . Incl Christmas and New Year 's Eve .
Our parties are often visit .
The people , the offers made by , the prices , but now they are afraid of , binding .
And if you ask us to ring it immediately , whether or not , in our view , this year 's Christmas on snow or " on matsch " will be in place by the operators of the informationsportals spindl.info , Martin jandura .
If the silvester-aufenthalt precisely in the spindelmühle after his ideas like that should no longer with the appointment hesitate .
Anyone who prefers the SAVE and the quality of the stay in second place , can try to wait a few days .
The spindelmühle-hotelbesitzer now provide for the silvestertag largely only wochenaufenthalte .
I think that it will be some time trying to sell it , but then you must also give in , and on shorter times .
And then the free rooms , jandura dwindling fast .
Free beds in all winterterminen always provides always incorporates the travel agency in ingtours vrchlabi .
Now we are most interested in the weihnachtswoche , which have not yet to be sold out .
In our offer is about half the seats are still .
That is why we have some cheaper weihnachtsaufenthalte prepared for the last time , the director of the travel agencies , ingtours Petr schiefert .
The silvestertag in riesengebirge can also offer the vrchlabi-reisebüro yet , but there is much less free seats .
Good ( also takes account of the first fourteen days in February , the rest will wintertermine sold on average .
This year is the interest of the winteraufenthalte negatively influenced by the fact that in riesengebirge is still not a snow .
The people are waiting to see whether snow .
Nobody wants to the end of the year in the mountains without snow .
Pisten should be verschneit within a week , this too will be schiefert Christmas , to be sold out .
The other way round and something better than last year , manage the room in the hotel horizon to fill in pecpod snezkou .
We are about to five per cent more than in the previous year .
On silvestertag and at Christmas , we have only a few free room .
There is a great deal of interest in the Polish holiday in the janua in February , and the business will also go well informed of the director of the best pec-hotels , Karel Rada .
80 % of the silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel in janske Omnia in zentralparkplatz lazne occupied .
On Christmas day remains in the latest hotel in janske lazne even half the beds .
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January , for which we have already been occupied approximately 60 % .
A bit weaker is now the February , but at the moment , if the snow is intended , is also in the interest of the aufenthalten riesengebirge , the director of the hotels Omnia , Erik sporysch .
On a more schneebescherung the riesengebirge-hotelbesitzer now wait .
On Thursday it should apply to rainfall can cool and if it is , it should be on the mountains snow .
But then again , come to a warming informed Jiri jakubsky from the site of the Czech wetteramtes in Hradec kralove .
Us : repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comic , with what schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama , the President with his reputation of the brightest , the strategy of his predecessor in the issue he repeatedly , even for the most stupid .
Finally , as he afghanistan-doktrin ausschwitzte its gaze longingly expected , it was that those on the kopierpapier from the busch-irak-szenariovor abschrieb three years .
Not only does it several times in the text itself , as the saying goes , " " in Iraq , he has even the name of the bush- declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration : ' new vorwärtsweg " , without hesitation .
In fact he three years ago the bush-idee - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as " irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision ' .
Subsequent months showed , however , that the recommendations of the military lands that was the only possible and has been very successful in this respect , in the news today that we are no longer talking about Iraq .
The reputation of Bush 's was that not improved objectively , because he has a much dankbarere his successor hintergelassen starting point , as it was to be expected .
Barack Obama in Afghanistan hopes that this miracle repeatedly .
In order to increase the contingent charged with keeping the military have asked him again , especially the oberkommandeur the afghanistan-operation general Stanley mccristal , even in spite of the subordinationsgewohnheiten protect the zaudernden severely criticised in the White House .
He called for 40 000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better .
The President was reluctant three months , but with no better idea came , and so it is a general wenistens about 10 , 000 soldiers betrayed .
From Europe , it has promised for another 5,000 , even if he were initially at least with 10 , 000 bureaucrats .
On the whole obama-strategie highly problematic is its projects , the troops from Afghanistan to withdraw in 18 months already , and this process can be finalised within three years , the whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers .
Some doubt as to the fact that the halbierte increase in the same effect as the measure will bring in Iraq .
Despite the bruderkrieg of recent years is the irak-gesellschaft relatively well structured , its leaders honours the values .
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation - it can rely on no one , and there are no agreements .
Under these circumstances , it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces which are accustomed to every day to change their minds .
The political institutions , even if they were established formally correct , that leaves only scheinbauten , behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen will make further out .
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is exceptionally complex , particularly because of a lack of transparency of the conditions that the Pakistan- and iran-einflüsse even more complex .
The building of a " strong state ' , which is the minimum objective of the whole operation is , is very unrealistic .
The time frame obama-strategie surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and only now is it on the fringes of the explosion .
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cries from the ' frühheimkehr " broke out a miracle here , can only create a truly romantic soul , which is not influenced by facts .
From the political point of view , the datumssetzung for redeployment pure irresponsibility , because the Taliban , as the indirect confession of American defeat will incorporate it .
The recent NATO Summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans , to combat in Afghanistan , is running out .
Europe 's politicians to their voters cannot and will not explain how the security of Germany and Italy , where the war in hindukusch-gebirgsvorland .
Another possible factor , the situation is radically can affect the development of events in Iran .
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question as to whether the problem cannot be solved by troops .
That is the question that must be answered in the period in which America after Obama is progressing in the siegerabzug from Afghanistan .
Any solution will , however , also a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation .
The only palliative measure for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election , and thus there is still enough time , so that it can be applied to a different strategy , fallls this as totalausfall would prove to be .
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no prämienboni more in cash
The chief executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs receive no prämienboni more this year in cash .
The company that has announced that , along with this , the sharp criticism of their lohnpraktiken response .
A group of 30 spitzenmanagern gets the money instead of stocks , but they can sell only in five years .
Furthermore , the shares the managers in the case be withdrawn if they are excessively risky .
Goldman Sachs , so in accordance with the agency Reuters at the forefront of efforts , the prämieboni Wall Street with long-term performance .
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware , in which it has to go , led by the former bankers society JPMorgan , Douglas Elliott .
The problem lies in the detail that he added .
Goldman Sachs , the target of criticism , having for the first three quarters of this year nearly $ 17 billion for prämienboni had set aside .
The overall size of the prämienboni in the course of this jahra will probably also after the agency Reuters reported today , despite the measure exceed 20 billion dollars .
The high prämienboni in the banking sector , with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the most burning political issue .
The United Kingdom has reported on Wednesday that it intended to bonuses of bankers , exceed the 25,000 pound , unique with a tax of 50 % .
Similar steps are also preparing for France .

Traditionally , the American President , Barak Obama , the most expected friedennobelpreis this afternoon , in Oslo .
In his speech he has the kontrovere his appointment , because it is only at the beginning of his way , and also at the top of the country , which introduces two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .

President Vaclav Klaus is the finance ministers on Friday morning , Eduard janota , on his would remain within the government because he , with the implementation of the staatsbudgets for next year in the form which this through the abgeordnetenversammlung was released on Wednesday , does not agree .
It was accepted that the budget , and perhaps also the retention of janota in the cabinet of the issues will be freitagstreffens .

The government has objected to the proposals of the Social Democrats , to increase the budget deficit in a covert way .
The Left Party between , on the one hand , and the government rechtspartei , Klaus and , on the other hand , is a severe domestic political dispute has arisen , dessentwegen the question marks about the further work of the fischer-beamtenkabinetts , on which the ODS , CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring .
Critics claim that the budget , as it was approved by Parliament , the package of austerity , virtually wiped out by the fischer- government have been implemented in the autumn , and the following your understanding the public debt .
Klaus , of the law of the state reacts can sign must not , however , stated today in the diskussionsfrühstück with business that the politicians ' serious problem ' , the ' the unsustainable deficit " of public finances , longer time have neglected .
In his opinion , there is not a good solution .
Only an improvement could bring a strong government , is still on a broader consensus of the political parties could build .
The ods-vorsitzende , Mirek Topolanek , led to that this budget is terrible , and the government should weigh up their continued existence .
The ods-stellvorsitzende , Petr necas the ctk , said that the concept of the beamtenkabinetts CSSD , with the support of ODS and grünenpartei obviously no longer works .
Prime Minister Fischer has described in the drawing-up similar words as a " strong worry . "

Mandela was in the new film by clint Eastwood played freeman of Morgan
The South Africans claim that the new hollywood-film ' invictus : the ungeschlagene " of the world shows that much of the country , of its fight and win despite some criticisms that the key role of an American actors appointments .
The story of sport , rassenverhältnissen and on Nelson Mandela .
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid-regierungssystem in the South African Republic , as well as their first black President Nelson Mandela , is in his personal history of the American oscar-schauspieler , Morgan freeman .
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela , whether he could be eastwood- film in it .
A further important role little Damon .
I said to him : ' If you are , then I will take them .
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors , of the price for his role in the eastwood-drama from the boxbereich ' baby ' million dollars had already received , the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery , in the end , is done by slave owners to become a fictitious usa-präsidenten God , and also in " Evan omnipotent ' , but rarely someone who is still alive , and for many people like Mandela is so important .
The former südafrikanischestaatsmann was for its active role of the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison .
It was in 1990 undfür released in four years , he has been President of the country .
In 1993 it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
" invictus ' is the Latin word for ' ungeschlagen ' , and at the same time it is the name of a gedichtes William Ernest henley author of English , which was issued in the year 1875 .
The requirement to speak , as he was
The film cites a true story in the Nelson Mandela of his forces with the captain of the South African rugbyteams , Francois pienaar , zusammenschloss to some of the country 's new President Mandela knows that its people will still rassenmäßig after apartheid and economically remains divided .
He believes that his people through sport can agree , therefore , the rugbyspieler he decides to outsiders , belong to the world .
Finally , the South African team up in the world of the year 1995 .
Freeman worked for several years , the mandela-geschichte in order to bring to the kinoleinwand .
He had no objective other than this role to play in bringing this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality , said freeman .
The greatest challenge , of course , so to speak , as it .
The actors said , if he and the world leader in the same country would be , he would try to meet with Mandela to evening with him in his speech to eat and behind the scenes .
The most important is for him to shake Mandela .
I have noticed that when I say that I accept the hand schüttele their energy , it will , and I had the feeling that I know what they are feeling , he said .
It is important to me , one other person .
Little Damon , in the film François pienaar , captain of the national rugbyteams , in which the white players have prevailed .
The actors said that he six months had time for the role in the hard rugbywelt .
It was a great surprise , for him , as he pienaar met for the first time in this House .
I remember when I took part in the türklingel rang that he opened up and the first thing that I too François pienaar in my life was said : ' in the film ' I see far higher .
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models , he has led by the director Eastwood ' invictus : ungeschlagen ' positive reviews , and we are also talking about a prospect of Oscar .
The filmkritiker took charge of the paper 's daily variety , Todd McCarthy , summed up his assessment in the following words : " that was very good , very good ausgeführter film . "
In the filmrezensionen on the web-seiten rottentomatoes.com , has invictus 76 % positive assessments .
Lichtgeheimnis on Norway dissolved , the Russians have tested a missile
On Norway has been a particular lichteffekt of unknown origin .
Only yesterday the Russian Ministry has admitted that far from the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested .
But the start was not successful as a type bulava " and the " missile , which were the pride of the Russian army should be , is beginning to be a nightmare of the Russian generals and the Taoiseach , Vladimir Putin .
Its repeated presence on the ground in the raketetest had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge .
Bulava launched at all is often not been damaged or in the air .
Do you in the Russian newspapers about ' bulava " rather than a " missile " , which is not a fee .
A missile , however , is not the
This was already 13 attempt , at the start of normal .
Until the end of the journey , in turn , technical damage to the missile .
Presumably , there was the driving force in the third raketenstufe .
This time , " bulava ' from the nuclear submarine Dmitry donskij , which under the water of the White Sea off .
This raketentyp facilitates the shooting down of the submarine .
That is why it is likely to be caused by an unspecified fliegendes mysterious light on nordwegen indeed the damaged ' bulava " was .
Moreover , for the first time the Norwegians , there is no doubt that there is a Russian missile .
Has the generals in diesesmal and claims that it does not clearly of a failure .
The first two stages of the missile fell from and the accident was not only the third stage .
In the previous cases , regardless of the engines in the first stage damaged .
Even if no teststart without mistake was made , is still in charge of the defence ministry only six of thirteen for unsuccessful .
The almost fünfzigprozentige success therefore fulfilled the generals with optimism and it will continue to be claimed that the " bulava " will fly without problems and even to ten hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with a gesamtgewicht of Max . 1.15 tonnes .

Czech discovery : a substance , even in the more gestählten ´ HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new links to the spread of HIV viruses in organism should stop .
The main benefit of improved substance is that , at the viruses works that are resistant to medicines .
This fact , against the drawback is that the link to normal virus-varianten is not as strong as one of the existing medicines .
The disease AIDS cannot be cured .
The patients can the medikamentenzusammenstellung but life extend the proliferation of HIV viruses and prevent the body .
Their use , but of a whole series of side effects .
Incomplete oppression of the virus-vermehrung also has the development . Resistentviren SG , against which do not lead to more effective medicines .
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences cr , of the vscht ( chemisch-technologische seminary ) Prague , as well as of the university in Heidelberg opens the way in which we can deal with the virus-resistenz .
You have shown that the as metalokarborane substances known to the eiweißstoff work , which is responsible for the hiv-viruses .
The metalokarborane are links from Bor , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt .
These links , the virus-vermehrung in a different way than all medicinal products used today , so they can overcome the resistenz-problem .
In its work , the scientists to new ´ improved ´ links , on the basis of the knowledge of the molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viren-eiweißstoff were prepared .
The metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure : two vielfächige cages , from bor- , hydrogen technology and kohlenstoff-atomen exist and by a metall-atom , in this case , cobalt , are linked .
Heimtückisches and maintainable virus
Hiv-protease is eiweißstoff of the HIV virus , for the life cycle of the virus is essential .
Without the hiv-virus-spaltung caused by the hiv-protease tyres infektionsvirenpartikel would not arise .
If we go on in the hiv-protease we also eliminate the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients from , say , the scientists in the press release by the Institute for organic chemistry and green chemicals the Academy of Sciences cr was issued .
In the paper published in the journal of medicinal wissenschaftszeitung chemistry has been published , describe the scientists following the links , in which two couples of battery cages ( see table ) by a brief organic chain are linked , the then alter systematically .
A weaker , but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the hiv-protease wurdne tested in the mark , even against their steady ( resistant ) variants of HIV-infected patients have been won .
The effect of the metalokarborane in the usual enzym-variante is not as dramatically as in the clinical use of medicines , but they do not lose their effect on the resistentvarianten , against the use of medicines are often ineffective .
The unique wirkungsmechanismus and their further characteristics , such as biological and chemical stability , low , were aware and possibility of chemical lie , makes the metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines to combat HIV , says pavlina research aimed rezacova laboratories for strukturbiologie , head of the institutes for organic chemistry and green chemicals and of the institutes for in molecular genetics is the Academy of Sciences .
Dispute about budget . ODS referred to fishermen , the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS , Mirek Topolanek , called the approved budget for next year than " horrifying ' and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer , in his opinion , should consider their continued existence .
The statement by the Prime Minister and the ODS called " strong worry . "
It is supposedly time for the analysis .
The Deputy ods-vorsitzende , Petr necas , said that the concept of the beamtenkabinetts CSSD , with the support of ODS and grünenpartei obviously no longer works .
After necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to look at in Parliament to support the minority , when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit , or whether it be in order to remain in office through the parlamentlinken .
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to necas differently .
Parliament has on Wednesday , the budget for the year 2010 , but with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen adopted on more than 12 billion kronor .
This Parliament has the money for staatsbeamtengehälter , for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers .
The government has objected to the proposals of the Social Democrats , to increase the budget deficit in a covert way .
The Czech Republic , a backlog of 163 billion kronor economies .
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote , so it is the wish of the government , because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budgetprovisoriums frase not clear .
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister Eduard janota , on his disappointment and a sense of futility , whereas premier Jan Fischer has stated that the government to assess the current situation .
Necas is convinced that , if janota seriously with his resignation of the case that would have threatened the abänderungsvorschläge were to be adopted , the situation would be different .
In accordance with the Czech TV has janota on Monday to the regierungsgeschäft notified to the Prime Minister .
In the process , he indicated that he be considered further to remain in office .
This is why his disappointment on the verhandugn of budget .
To what extent are fishermen for the continuing fight with the budget-defizit have necas , pursuant to the nominanten the Social Democrats ( CSSD ) , the changes in the budget enforced in the government had nothing to do with .
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he would resign if Parliament continues defizit-steigernde laws , for example , the sickness pay and pensions or the dienstgesetzesnovelle concern .
Topolanek : the by ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not
That is the job of the Prime Minister , fishermen and the whole government .
The ODS nominated by the Ministers have not made mistakes , has Topolanek in a textmeldung from the United States .
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function , who are committed to the top 09 which voted against the budget .
Necas stressed that , if fishermen decides in favour , in the fight against the defizit-höhe of public finances , " it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the linksmehrheit , which is at present in Parliament is ' .
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of Civil Democratic Party not .
I have not thought about , and if that is applicable , then I shall look into this matter , said the of the Civil Democratic Party nominated Defense Minister Martin bartak the journalists in Parliament .
Prime Minister Fischer was flying in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels .
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister ,
At the same time necas stressed that the ODS probably on Wednesday in the European Parliament were to vote against the amended budget , if the Prime Minister , the members of the Civil Democratic Party expressly ask that they would be the adoption of the budget .
We are not as orphans , we are not small children , so he responded then on the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament , as well as in the Czech Republic has not diminished .
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking .
Even when I gave to the mandate , I knew that , in coming months , particularly in relation to bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positive would go reacted Topolanek itself .

The fernlangstrecken in the capital city in the zielstation Prague - hauptbahnhof ends .
The CD is more lines sc pendolino between Prague and Ostrava a and trains after sumperk / jesenik will drive in the space of two hours .
With the pendolino passengers can no longer since 13 December in Bratislava .
This year 's bill for regionaleisenbahn increase of EUR 200 million .
The schnellzüge are paid , and by the Ministry of Transport as a whole will give the railways to reimburse the so-called liquiditätsverlusts in the next year four billion Danish kroner , as this year . Genaus the lokalzüge providing districts , they have to pay for a total of eight billion kronor in next year , with the state zuschießt three billion .

Vaccination against pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against pneumokokken changes from January the usual .
It is a first for the families be voluntary and free of charge .
What , however , is that the pflicht-impfung vote would be more effective .
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate .
The arzneiinstitut is already the maximum prices of vaccines which insurance companies have to pay .
The experts are also aware of the impfungsverfahren .
New vaccination
Vaccines for august-kinder charge
From January children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken charge on 2 August last year were born and later .
The condition that they would not have received impfdosis .
Anyone who has been to the vaccination in last year or earlier has begun , must also pay weiterewiederholungsimpfung itself .
The first impfdosis must between 3 and 5 . Lebensmonat of the child .
Already last year , a quarter of the families their children against pneumokokken vaccination .
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose .
For the vaccination of the recent children are four doses .
On the whole , the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities SEK 300 , 000 to 450 , 000 per year .
But in the way they save the children without vaccination would need .
Up to now , the state of children for all flächenimpfungen spent approximately 500 , 000 per year .
The pflicht-impfung was introduced with the so-called janota-paket .
Pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung , but also cause serious infections including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung .
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years ago .
Outside of the Czech Republic , the pflicht-impfung of children against pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries .
Will the vaccination duty ?
At the same time it is said that these vaccination in the future could be mandatory .
From January is paid for by the insurance and be voluntary .
That would be better for the pflicht-impfung mentioned , for example , the head of the bürgervereinigung , nahlas Rudolf kalovsky .
His association , even in the long term for the pneumokokken-impfung .
The experts at the international conference , to which our group was involved were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination .
That is not an ideal .
On the other hand , we are pleased that we have managed , at least this through .
I believe that this is the road which we now need to go , led to kalovsky .
The Ministry of the impfverfahren against pneumokokken but will not change .
At the moment , we are not at all , vlastimil sesen his spokesman said .
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks , claim the doctors .
The chairman of the fachgesellschaft of practical kinderärzten , Hana cabrnochova , agrees that there is a voluntary vaccination its disadvantages .
If all children would be vaccinated , then we could reflect on the reduction of the wiederholungsimpfungszahl " in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive that we understand the political decision that this vaccination as a voluntary was launched , " says allerdingst cabrnochova .
The experts expect more than 80 % of parents their babies against pneumokokken inoculated from next year .
The vaccination against pneumokokken is also broke new ground in this as a first flächenimpfung is paid for by the insurance companies and not the state .
The insurance companies should spend the money for the prevention , in order to save it for further treatment , erkärt cabrnochova .
The doctors have to buy the vaccines itself .
This is a concern of the practical kinderärzte , linked to the purchase of vaccines .
After the original plans should be purchased by insurers vaccines and the doctors have them in the same way as other received by the state to it spent on vaccines .
Some Members were concerned , however , that the insurance as " the money from the krankenversicherungherausführen . "
That is why the doctors vaccines and buy themselves , will have to wait until the insurance companies to pay for them .
According to the estimates , the various practical doctors must invest SEK 40 000 per month , which is a significant figure .
This will not be easy , says cabrnochova .

Islam can be French ?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state .
At a time when the Swiss electorate for a bauverbot voted for minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread , John bowen , an American academics , a thorough and well-considered report written about whether Muslims in one of the background säkularisiertesten societies of Europe – can be integrated and be integrated .
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the final work of the author : " why the French No scarves love " ( originaltitel : " why the French don ’ t like headscarves ' ) ( 2006 ) read an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue , which the country over one and a half decades , and employees and their effects are still exercise .
Bowens neustes book provides a more comprehensive and kühneres range .
As a good anthropologe he would not only like to know what the politicians and the media about Islam say in France , but what is really happening in the area .
He has months in mosques , schools and colleges , which is now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France , as it bowen calls " Islamic space ' .
It is a good listener , it gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most .
Should a Muslim in a mosque marry or a city ( or both ) ?
Should young Muslims on evolution and rights of homosexuals detainees ?
A Muslim women can marry a nichtmuslimischen man ?
Is it permissible for a Muslim , to use a zinsorientiertes banking system , in order to obtain a mortgage ?
It is these seemingly more down-to-earth affairs , he claims , the daily life , unlike the political drama , what the media .
The author recognises a new generation of imams , teachers and intellectuals , none of them with a well-known names , possibly with the exception of tarik Ramadan born in Switzerland , the Arab / Muslim scholars and academics .
This new generation sought to reopen the debate , as it is possible , on the one hand , a good Muslim and , on the other hand , a good citizens in a modern secular society .
They do not have all the arguments on their side .
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam .
The thinkers and activists , the bowen respondents , are often at odds with their salafi-gegenstücken – exponents of puristischen Sunni Islam in connection with Saudi Arabia , which today is a small but influential presence among Europe 's Muslims .
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible .
But an agreement requires both give and take on both sides .
He is calling into question the extent to which French policymakers ( and the intellectual elite , the so passionate the separation of Church and State watches ) really committed to the pluralism .
He suggests that Muslims may be a rauere treatment as Catholics , Protestants and Jews , which in turn their historic compromise with the secular republicanism had to make .
It is rather a ' stricter werteschrauben " as a growing pragmatism .
Islam can be French ? after reading this book , one is inclined to say ' yes , but not yet ' .
The trostloseste outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other umweltregion on earth .
The ice is melting , indicates that it is increasing at an alarming rate and adopted lives , the anywhere else can survive .
Oil , gas , schifffahrts- and fishing interests , in the newly open water , with diplomats , lawyers and now also authors in their wake .
Mr Ellis , a writer , and illustrator in " walking on thin ice ' ( originaltitel on thin : " I " ) a naturgeschichte the icon of the North , the polar bears .
In the complicated history and main policies of whaling , he describes the long tradition of arktiserforscher , which found itself in the hunt for the polar bears .
Admiral nelsons meeting with a polar bears as brave 14-year-old fähnrich at sea , the only with the gewehrkolben its muskete fought , is certainly a myth , but others are true .
Young bears , which , as you have been caught behind the bodies of their recent schwammen mothers , were killed in zoos and circuses .
At the beginning of the twentieth century , a zirkusaufführung showed 75 polar bears an idea .
Even today zooanlagen still have a millionstel typically the privacy of wild alttiers . The climate is rarely appropriate : the eisbär in Singapore , as a Green , of the algae in the hollow hair grow their fur .
This proposal , in order to know more .
Ellis relates to the reports of other authors and historians , and often to the threat , the hunters for the survival of the species .
Although in Norway , America and Russia , which has been banned in Greenland and Canada - where hunters in helicopters and motorschlitten-fahrende Inuits powerful sturmgewehre use , in order to bring their prey on the line .
Ironically , in the waters of the North of these two jagdnationen the ice longest remain .
In his new book ' after the ice ' ( originaltitel after the " i " ) provides alun Anderson , a former editor of the wissenschaftsmagazins " new scientist " , a clear and alarming description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight into the way the future could develop .
Not that scientists have all the answers .
Neither atmosphärenwissenschaftler can still ozeanografen adequately explain the speed of change .
However , this is not a lack of erklärungsversuchen .

This suggests that the gesamtwertung through the treatment of those at the top end of the scale have raised , which is difficult and problematic , said Jeff Smith , Member of the board of D.C. voice , a voluntary group that bildungsgleichheit in Washington that C. .
I springe not for a range of two or three points , and , said the democratic Washington stadtratsmitglied , Kwame R. Brown , of a daughter in the fourth category of eaton-grundschule .
Brown , a lot of rhee critics of the managementstils , said , the message of the prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools need urgent attention of the city .
Of course we would like to see the positive signs , that I respect .
I am worried , however , is that we do not spend approximately the time and energy that we would have to commit to our mittelschule .
Rhee said , the district , must continue to find better ways to the needs of the leistungsschwachen pupils .
This autumn , for example , a number of teachers are trained , a new leselehrplan , the wilson-lese-system , to devote to pupils in the upper classes of primary school and mittelschule what basic skills of reading aimed not at the start of its schullaufbahn and have mastered the significantly behind their young counterparts , klassenkameraden behind .
Everyday mathematics , a curriculum , the from kindergarten training on the Sixth class games and lebensechte experience in the centre stage , was under the former chief schulinspektor clifford janey brought to Washington and the curriculum , some of the naep-fortschritte , the last week , have been reported .
I believe that we still need to work to the best measures for the pupils to allow them to benefit from the notenniveau , said rhee .
Others say that the naep-ergebnisse highlight the question whether rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to play this extra money and the resources for the leistungsschwachen schools can be made available , which are necessary in order to reduce the gap .
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle rhee fuller Bruce said , professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley , the urban audit findings .
The conventional medicine is , its resources and management reforms in the schools , which are in the poorest areas of Washington D.C. .
The objective of political repercussions , which could cause working against this important item on the agenda .
The weak point is , of course , as in other urban schulinspektoren trying to the white and black middle class .
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools .
We must strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods , so that all families , irrespective of where they live , can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education .
Janey Newark , which is now in schulinspektor this week , said in an interview that one of the most important elements to the closure of the leistungskluft consists in the traditional public school year , which currently stands at 180 days in Washington , in order to extend to compete with the charter-schulen .
It must be the school year on nearly 200 days , in order to have the power to change , said janey , with its lehrergewerkschaft last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year , which he called " a milestone " towards a greater increase in the next Treaty .
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach the gettysburg-college achieved a resounding home .
Graciela Rodriguez , 12 , is rising from and blinzelt a moment on seeing the white pillars , the ziegelsteinfassaden and of the smaragdgrünen lawn .
Gracielas highschool parents have completed in El Salvador .
Until recently , which also had graciela in silver spring has been recovered and now lives in riverdale , never set foot in a college-campus .
Their position and that of the other achtklässler explore the group , the gettysburg , where the teaching per year costs $ 38.690 was more ehrfurchtsvollen besuchers , than that of an enthusiastic future students .
' Yes , I will be here soon ! ' , graciela who would like to study medicine , as the leaders proclaimed that they now entering the buildings for science .
" Wow , really ? " said they food for thought , as the low professor-zu-studenten-verhältnis school .
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7 , that the children to their three-day tour visited and now they have completely accommodated the intended message : the question is not whether to the College .
The question is where .
On the one hand , there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants , not an end , or what the highschool as a teenager become pregnant , on the other hand , there are hundreds of thousands , which received the collegeausbildung that is needed in the middle class levels .
In truth , one in five of these ' second generation ' of hispanoamerikaner the College – which is a remarkable achievement is that many of its immigrierten parents , mostly from Mexico and Central America , in the United States , without the highschool came to have completed .
Their success stories are important , because they say researchers , for a generation , which is a huge role to play in the labor force in the country , will show the way forward .
Those who say , high-performance children to investigate these very often have a natural affinity for the school and a its inherent momentum to success .
Many of you have also parents who give their children to set high targets and to find ways of making their lack of familiarity with American schools .
But beratungsprogramme also play a major role by you graciela and millions of children as they help in college , especially if these efforts for long periods of time .
If you look at low-income children whose parents have no experience and skills , you in the wegsuche through the system to help a single measure , then , at some time or another , do nothing to resolve the problem , said Patricia gándara , a researcher at the University of California at Davis , the hispanoamerikanische students studied .
We have to think about it , for these children a network of pre-school and supported by the highschool .
The bundesprogramm , the gracielas college-tour had financed , is a useful example .
It is known as gear up - to hochschalten - and is more than USD 300 million per year for local school systems are available to start to tie college-vorbereitungsprogramme if low-income pupils in the mittelschule are and will continue until they have completed the highschool .
In accordance with the us-department for education , the programme for 1999 helped more than 10 million pupils , of which more than 60 % in college are gone .

US Secretary of Defense gates : Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
M. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be " significant additional sanctions on Iran impose ' , because it does not take part in discussions on his atompläne .
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen journey through the kriegsgebiete in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of approximately 300 US troops in northern Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran down .
In Iran , there are no good opportunities for election , he said in response to the question of soldiers to the likelihood of such a development .
" one of the items on the soul , is , if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq , the own unvorhersagbarkeit . "
The obama-regierung prefers a sanktionspaket in recital on the military and political elite of Iran , but gates has announced that a number of sanctions could also affect the durchschnittsiraner .
He said that a ' package of positive and negative incentives ' , ' is necessary in order to convince the Iranian Government that it with weapons in reality is less protected their people ' , because ' terribly ' from the sanctions will suffer .
On Friday , in an opinion by the Speaker of the White House , Robert gibbs , the American Government the European leaders in the warning that Iran with " credible ' consequences must reckon with its nuclear programme , if they do not comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its atom-überwachungsorganisation , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of the nuclear power stations only for peaceful purposes should be won .
During the talks in Geneva on 1 October said of Iran that he talks on the restriction of its nuclear programme would resume , and an essential part of their lagerbestands to depleted uranium in exchange for much-needed nuklearbrennstoff for his medical research reactor would forgo .
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations .
Iran does , however , since that time , the negotiations on the subject of the interim agreement to leave have experts say -- partly because the Iranian leadership is about whether you should commit to the United States .
The international community that Iran in relation to a number of proposals , which had already been agreed at the beginning of October , has left , has simply are , frankly , the international community , including the Russians and the Chinese , in a way , as it brought together in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran , were never said gates .
President Obama has the 31 dez. set a deadline for Iran , to respond to these proposals , before he other options , including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called ' sanctions ' overwhelming , will continue .
In a statement made in New York , Iran 's representation at the United Nations , which condemns it on Thursday ' groundless and unfundierte allegations ' of certain members of the Iranian atomaktivitäten called and said that they are ready , the talks with the United States and five other world powers , " to continue in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution ' .
Gates , the last Friday should return to Washington , met on tomorrow with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , before he in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meeting with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish behördenvertretern in Irbil was flying .
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high , in particular in relation to borders , property rights and because of the distribution of public revenue .
Gates urging both parties to the conflict to reduce , in order to prevent delays in us-pläne , the American troops by the end of August by 115 000 to 50 000 .
Gates also tried , the Kurdish concerns about the impending withdrawal . Us-vertreter gates , referred to masud Barzani , President of the Kurdish regional government , said : " We will their security , prosperity and their autonomy within a unified Iraq .
We will not leave them . "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang weijia and her husband , surrounded by propagandaplakaten to lecture you thought that " mother earth is too tired to have more children ' and ' a baby more means a grave more ' .
These lessons , they learned that , as well as government officials in Shanghai , by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer , suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten , more than to have a child directly and once and for all , your answer was : ' In any case ' .
We already have all our time and energy in a child .
For a second child is nothing more to be said , Wang , 31 , a personalleiterin with a 8-monate old son .
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China , the two generations of notoriously dicklichen , verzogenen einzelkindern affectionately , the ' small Emperor ' mentioned , has produced a bevölkerungskrise in the country .
The average birth rate is to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force , is , like the UN
Department on demography , while the number of the population of 60 years of age and older 16.7 % by the year 2020 by 2050 the population of 31,1 % to rocket . This is far higher than the world average of around 20 % .
This imbalance is in rich coastal cities like Shanghai , with better educated population , stronger .
Last year , 60-jährige and older almost 22 % of the reported inhabitants shanghais , agreed during the birth rate among a child per couple .
Lingli Xie , head of the Shanghai stadtbevölkerungs- and familienplanungskomission said that couples babies normal reproductive age must be given in order to ' help , the ratio of the ageing bevölkerungsanteile to reduce labour shortages and to alleviate the future ' .
Shanghai will soon be " as old -- but not so rich -- as the developed countries , such as Japan and Sweden , they said , ' .
A gradual recovery
In the country 's constitution in 1978 , China 's one-child policy , probably the most controversial should be provided by the ruling Communist Party to date has been introduced .
Against this policy married couples , must reckon with enormous fines -- up to its triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in their work .
Chinese staatsvertreter have attributed to this policy , the critical pressure on the natural landesressourcen could be avoided , while human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy have condemned .
In rural regions have already some officials pregnant women who were forced to a child abzutreiben .
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortions , which will carry out an unnatural high ratio of women to men .
In the last few years for public officials have gradually weakened its position in relation to the " one-child " policy .
In 2004 , more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers , members of ethnic minorities and the number of cases in which both husband and wife have been einzelkinder -- and 2007 , the tone of many hard slogans watered down .
Qiao xiaochun , a professor at the University Institute for bevölkerungsforschung Beijing recently said that officials have discussed even more radical changes , for example , couples to allow two children , which is a partner einzelkind .
Shanghai in July was the first Chinese city , the aggressive campaign to promote more births has launched .
The families belehrten billboards , only to have a child , have been replaced by directives almost overnight , the describe in detail for a second child , who is and how we can ask for approval .
The city authorities , municipal employees and voluntary for family planning , sent to couples go home and informationsblätter durchzuschieben under the doors .
You also asked about psychological and financial advice for the available , the more than to have a child .
The response was not encouraging , said familienplanungsvertreter .
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the außenbereichen of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognise is that after the start of the campaign to a second child , the urban districts against any change report .
In the Community huinan go with a population of 115 000 per month , for example , still only four or five requests .
Disheartened Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city , despite the campaign is still around 165.000 -- will be slightly higher than 2009 , but lower than 2008 .
Feng juying familienplanungskomitees , head of the Shanghai Community caolu , said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children .
They want their first the best , you said .
Yang jiawei , 27 , and his wife , Liu juanjuan , 26 , said that they would like to have two children , and this is also legally permitted .
But they have , as many Chinese , only a minor sickness and life insurance , the government .
Without a social safety net , they say , this decision would be irresponsible .
People in the West assess the one-child policy as the human rights issue , said Yang , an engineer , his wife in the seventh month is pregnant with their first child .
Indeed , it is robbing us the possibility to have more than one child .
The problem , though , is not simply a policy .
The problem is money .
Other couples for psychological reasons give your hesitations .
Wang , the personalleiterin , said that they would like to just one child , because it was a einzelkind . " we were at the centre of the family and used that each of us .
We are not accustomed to us , and it does not really want to . "
Chen zijian , a 42-jähriger , a übersetzungsunternehmen more merciless heard it said .
For parents from small businesses with doppelkarriere , through which the birth rate is falling , he said , it is about to be successful and one has to be selfish .
The age of 20 to 39-jährigen today of their parents grew during the early days of the Chinese kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see as a life for themselves , under any circumstances , he said .
Even a single child , he said , is huge demands on the time of parents .
A mother , their social life for at least two years .
Then there is the raumfrage -- " we must rebuild his home " -- and the limited -- " if the child 9 months old , is already a bio foresee for the best nurseries . "
The majority of his friends are ready , this is a time durchzumachen , said Chen , but not twice .
Our generation is the first , which has achieved a higher standard of living , he said .
We do not want to take too many victims .
Uno-gruppe sketches plan to reduce emissions
Funded by the UN conference on climate change , which up to now by wild Poznań and recrimination , on Friday was emphasized during -- has with the publication of a document which , once again , a priority for the next 40 years an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases , recording the industrialised nations in the near future have to shoulder the main burden .
The text , which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide both the remaining obstacles , has their exchange rates , as well as the way forward .
But it was an important step forward in a negotiation of the time , regarded as next week , more than 100 leaders from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen .
The text , which was created by a special UN working group has been formulated , is silent on the money supply , the rich countries to poor countries should be in the short and long term , so that they can deal with the global warming .
It also represents a range of options for the key issues , including as industrial and major emerging countries reduce their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be that the political decision-makers .
The process will be a great deal of flexibility , as John coequyt , a senior representative of the Sierra clubs in Washington .
Michael Zammit cutajar , of the six pages of text , has drafted a 180 pages long verhandlungstext , so that in the centre , with the UN , the leading klimaschutzvertreter yvo , Mr de Boer , as " the big picture .
It shows the plans for a possible agreement , in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25 % to 45 % , compared with the limit values of 1990 , would reduce their emissions , while major developing countries in the same period of 15 to 30 % would reduce .
The countries together could emissions by 2050 at 50 % and 95 % .
The European Community has the talks on Friday in addition a boost given by your assurance , over the next three years USD 3.6 billion per year , in order to help the poorest countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the face of the floods and drought and avoiding deforestation .
The Friday , yet the same verbal fireworks , what the discussions in the last week had intended .
The American klimasonderbeauftragte Todd Stern wordings , has rejected the binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries , compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging countries , are asking for , if they are not to be financed by the industrialized countries .
This train has announced that the obama-regierung a tougher line with China , as a representative of the Bush administration is not more than two years ago .
The United States will sign an agreement , without any significant emerging economies stand up and take action so that the Stern , also , that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions by outsiders could be confirmed .
Stern issued an opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese vizeaußenministers he yafei , which stated that the leading American klimaunterhändler either to " common sense , " or " feels extremely irresponsible " of him was that he said at the beginning of the week , that the United States would not help China financially , global warming .
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers that are at stake , both within the industrial nations , as well as between the industrialised and emerging countries become fault lines .
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies , as well as to the rescue of the planet , with China and the United States , because of their respective commitments squabbles , while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need , more courageous action .
Ricardo ulate , a delegate from Costa Rica , said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting , who is the cost of the bremsung should bear the treibhausgasausstoßes , since even the countries affected have begun to take action , aggressive in the countries with very high treibhausgasabgabe to account for their actions .
This is quite clearly a game , which is to develop a new economic domination , so ulate , also as a regional klimawandelberater for conservation internationally in Mexico and Central America is operating .
Some of the countries that are the effects of climate change are most exposed to , said that they continue to be a legally binding treaty would fight in Copenhagen , although the leading participants say that the talks in the best case , will lead to a political agreement .
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning has presented a 24-seitigen draft Treaty .
Artur runge-metzger , of the international negotiations on climate change for the European Commission , and said that the offensive of the small island States ' political pressure on the entire political process , " in part because they now are united and measures of the emerging countries , such as China and India , are calling for .
The talks got a new urgency , as the delegates are focused on the fact that most of the questions that have to be resolved before the arrival of the regierungsführer must be clarified , in order to reach an agreement .
High Representative , such as the Indian Minister for the environment , jairam ramesh and the Chinese vizeminister entstiegen their aircraft and they take rest breaks through the corridors of bella-centers to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to establish their claims to be negotiated during the next week .
The sheer scale of the Assembly 13,000 people -- daily in the kongresszentrum one and , gitarrespielende activists are holding night-time shows , in which they make a joke about the countries which you feel betrayed and sell , and draft to be passed on hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge .
The intensity has been building is only just : almost all important ministers are now here and on Wednesday , 60 regierungsführer in Copenhagen .
We shall now proceed to the oberliga , said Mr Manuel Rodríguez , Vice-President for global policy of organisation conservation internationally .

Britain 's first 225 km / h faster train defines the montagsgefühl new
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe permeate the darkness to announce a zugabfahrt a revolution in transport in the United Kingdom .
The first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country , with blitzfahrt of ashfort Kent , to London , St pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes to go .
To Lord adonis , the transport ministers , will then lady Kelly Holmes on board of the first javelin-pendlerservices from London .
He hopes that the new service Britain finally to an international railway trains will ankoppeln faster , more reliable and the major urban areas and the midlands , of the north of Scotland is up in London .
Could the neglected province , arbeitsanfahrtszeiten to living pendlerstädten would be radically reduced and the change of aircraft and car to railways would the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads .
In theory , do the three main parties in this vision .
But the British pound , which for the construction of a new national networks are needed , the inevitable planungsschlacht and fears about environmental damage in the British hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still start applying the brakes .
High speed two ( hs2 ) , a company based in January , that the government should present a viability study , Lord adonis according to the times the report on 30 December .
This gives it a detailed streckenkarte the next planned stage of the hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes .
The new railway line , the London with the West Midlands , with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places vorbeiführen , where the effects on the environment are controversial .
In the free terrain , the plan the concept within a gap of 25 metres from the final stretch .
Hs2 should also three options for a larger , leading hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetz northwards .
Lord adonis will respond in the spring .
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route , in which an individual high-speed link in the West Midlands .
The route would make itself or in the vicinity of Birmingham parts and a abzweig would west of the pennines lead to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of north-east after Sheffield , Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne .
A single line would lead to Scotland .
" It seems to be the most effective option , " said one eisenbahn-insider .
After the completion would offer the tourist season between London and Edinburgh 40 minutes to two hours .
The first section , which would not be opened in 2025 , it would allow the travelling public , the route london-birmingham in 49 minutes , compared with today , to go a little more than an hour .
The proposals are the outlines of the possibility , with a speed of 400 km / h , which means that the British railway network would be the quickest of Europe .
The first line has been planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximalkapazität of 1 000 people to be able to travel .
Up to 18 trains per hour could london-birmingham seems to be in operation .
This in turn would mean that a terminus station in London , would be needed to travellers can handle 20,000 per hour .
In view of the space limitations in the capital , it is expected that an existing station would be strengthened in order to accommodate the high-speed network .
Bahnexperten say that only St pancras international or euston this potential .
Lord adonis will be known whether this plan , in his opinion , should be continued or not , but the long-term public consultation and planungsmaßnahmen mean that a final decision after the parliamentary elections will be taken .
But if he is setting the wheels in motion in sections of the railway network must be built .
Trains should begin with the high-speed lines on existing the railway tracks in the north of Birmingham change the tourist season , which continues to be between London and Scotland would be about three hours .

The parteienbündnis UDF ( Union for the French democracy ) will vigorously and calls on the party Nouveau centre on , no longer to use their Siegel
The parteienbündnis by François Bayrou ’ s Party modem is monitored , on Friday to a tentative takeover of the label , the past by Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing established party , from the chairman of the Party Nouveau centre , Mr Hervé Morin , reacted strongly and under threat of a judicial persecution , this stamp on any document more .
Mr Hervé Morin publicly announces its intention to take this udf-siegel , since he is of the opinion that François Bayrou , would not be worthy of this political heritage to defend after he had the left hand does .
The defence ministers , whose parteipartner the UMP is , incidentally , wanted this strategy on Saturday in the National Council of NC .
The emphasis his efforts he has had the support of the honourable Members Mr Hervé de Charette ( ehemalig UMP , now in NC ) , of a right of the property of the brand UDF , because he was the first that mark the 2004 ' Institute national de la propriété industrial " has asked for .
However , the geschäftstelle of François Bayrou 's friends parteienbündnisses UDF oversaw the silence and was clearly to understand that they could not expropriate , the ministers and the Members under threat of a judicial persecution a deadline , not to use this Siegel and the property rights of the brand .
In the last few days , you have made a number of statements that you propose , their political movement would take the udf-siegelzu + + , wrote in one of the parteienbündnis 19 of the 24 büromitglieder letter signed , including François Bayrou and Marielle De Sarnez , the party modem , as well as the senator Jean arthuis of zentristischen alliance .
They may also believed that they have the right , the name of this movement + Nouveau centre + , of the slogans + today 's UDF + , on your political material , as well as on the startseite leads to their website .
As you know , they have no right to use this label and the secretariat of the UDF and calls on the party NC on , " without mentioning the name UDF of sämtlichem material , as well as by ( ITS ) website . "
Furthermore , one of Mr Hervé de Charette called " , the property rights of the brand to transfer of their legal anspruchsberechtigen . "
If they refuse to take action against it , we will impose respect for the law and the legitimate rights of the udf-mitglieder in order to defend , warned the undersigned .
In your letter , you emphasised that " UDF ' since 1978 and a fully-fledged political movement is a reminder that Morin and his friends ' ' have made the decision to leave this 2007 , in order to establish a competing movement , as others have done in 2002 , at the party " UMP ' .
The Party Nouveau centre , the undersigned , therefore has no rights , the udf-siegel ( Union pour La démocratie française ) .
They continue to remind you that the last congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year accession to the party modem , together with the establishment of a secretariat to defend " of the material and moral interests " of Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing , formed movement has adopted .
As regards Mr Hervé de Charette , it presupposes the Secretariat , ' he was at the time , as he has asked for the brand name , for three years , a Member of the UDF ' but the UMP .
He has benefited at scandalous and fraudulent manner , by the lack of depositing of akronyms UDF , in order to carry out this for themselves .
They continue to see that this recklessness , is on its way to turn itself into a criminal offence , and ironisieren the strategy of NC : ' It seems to be in politics , as well as in life dignified , itself a name , instead of trying to make out of anonymity , by relying on fraudulent way takes a name which has no legal rights ' .

Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung ?
If nothing will change in the running of the great French companies , our fight for the development of the economic intelligence in vain ...
For over a decade , the attitude of the management of major companies in relation to his staff , said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer from the marketing-revolution : it is to join the staff ' values ' is the best , as it was in the past on the consumer-produkte shaped by the technicians in work .
By giving the consumer at the heart of the company has the marketing-revolution the strategies of the conquest of markets in the place given the authoritarian temptation products ... despite separate factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again !
The demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation .
The suicides in France Telecom , PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon , which affects the employees in particular .
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company , especially those of R & eund , even more importantly , to those of the economic intelligence .
In fact , the calls for as ( intelligence Economique = economic intelligence ) ' of all the parties involved ( ... ) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision ' ; it is a commitment of the staff , the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradict each other .
That is why we are calling for a revolution that would involve , the staff of the concerns of the company in denmittelpunkt equal to the customer .
The very conditional use of internal opinion polls
Are the internal surveys of public opinion , as the questionnaire , the Orange his , has made this revolution in relation to the management-praxis suggest ?
I fear not , unfortunately .
- firstly , because I have noticed that the whole fabric in the face of a new situation following many deviations after all this , to do so as a matter of priority , ... as it has always done .
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies , the balance of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures .
And finally , because most of those in a highly simplistic idea of human behaviour .
From the large ingenieurschulen emerged is your interpretation of the psychology mechanistic .
They play in intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory , the recently by the United States ' neuroscience progresses ' be reactivated and unwittingly far-reaching of research institutes and through the media .
Therefore , and also suggests that it is possible , the " lever " ( sic ) on the involvement of employees , confirms to engage in a aktuellein Le figaro.fr appeared survey of ipsos the leaders in a position on a mechanistischen management system , which is inappropriate for today ’ s world .
The mobilisierungsfaktoren measure and identify
Instead , the key to the proper functioning of the modern companies necessary operational revolution , the adoption of a final view of human behavior .
It is , in any consideration or practice of management a fundamental minutes to integrate : for the workers is the commitment to the enterprises will only be possible if it clearly appears as a means for a part of their dreams , its ambition and their projects .
At the moment only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff .
These studies have shown that they do it on the basis of a given set doxa assess their wahrgenommenes picture of the company , to decide what it allows them to realise their lebensziele offers .
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these mobilisierungsfaktoren can the managers of companies ' social performance forecasts and anticipate " control , and your human resource management to the right place .
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable .
The speech of Oslo : the " just war , " Obama praise from the right a
The American rights , on Friday the of Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo crafted speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States has defended .
The Conservatives , the allocation of the price of Obama on 9 October were deceived , applauded in this case of the speech by the President , the example of the former vizepräsidentschafts-kandidatin in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin .
I liked what he said , Palin told the face of the right of the Republican Party in the newspaper us today and also added that it is the subject of a " sometimes necessary " war memoirs , published in ihrensoeben raised .
The war is , of course , the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it , but it is necessary .
We must stop the terrorists down there , it says .
Obama , the two wars of his predecessors George W. Bush has inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , on Thursday in Oslo , trying to justify the use of violence ; a way , its entscheidungvon nine days , 30 000 to explain to send more troops to Afghanistan .
Another opponents , Newt Gingrich by Obama , took the view that the präsdent Oslo ' have done very good work .
I found that the speech was very good indeed , frohlockte of the former President of the House of Representatives , especially the reference to ' the existence of evil in the world ' , in the words of Obama 's recognised .
In some parts habeich this speech at all ginrich perceived as historic , declared in the radio programme ' the takeaway ' has been consulted .
The previous Member by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination presidential 2012 will be regarded , said that he was pleased a ' President of the left " saw , of the members of the Nobel Committee remind us that they were not free " and a price for the peace could not pass , if the use of force would not exist ' .
For Michael gerson , a former writer of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post , Obama has ' a very American speech ' .
In addition to all this , that it is kosmopolit ' than ' , such as ' it has always power , " he ' as an American President said ' , as he has pointed out that the Europeans ' as a sicherheitsblase life which they do not themselves have created and for their protection do very little ' , so gerson .
Among the few , not won the rights of former uno-botschafter John Bolton , a hawk the Bush era , the speech on the website of the national review online as " boring , unfocused and inspirationslos ' .
On the left of the President is the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich concerned , as Barack Obama resorting to the armed forces .
The war we wrapped up under the guise of justice , this massacre of the innocents , quite simply , is warning justify it .
The press the moderate left , however , remains praise on the side of the President .
The Los Angeles Times , which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded premature to Obama , called the address itself for a speaker as him for his talent is known as ' monumentalwerk ' .
The speech in Oslo ' provides a ablaufplan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts , the poverty and oppression , " the Californian newspaper enthusiastic about it .
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama " the necessary discourse , " and his speech described as " bleak and exemplary ' at the same time .

The association fntr has denounced a " fraudulent trade ' because the EUR 100 million were the sector to offset part of the carbon tax has already been promised " .

The Moscow vize-bürgermeister Yuri rosljak and präfekt Anatoly Smirnov of selenograd led to the Russian delegation in Frankfurt , planungsdezernent Edwin black .
2010 there will be representatives of the fiz and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel .
Scientific exchange
It is a constant scientific exchanges .
But it is also about economic relations .
The fiz will enable firms to the growing Russian market penetration .
Conversely want Russian wissenschaftsfirmen contracts in Germany .
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian institutes and -unternehmen .
These include , for example , the Moscow Institute for elektronentechnik , the large corporations and rosssijskaja elektronika sitronics .
In 1958 , the Community was a so-called " socialist planstadt ' for the defence research has been established .
Selenograd ( literally ' translated ' ) , grünstadt his name of forest hügellandschaft , are embedded in the research establishments .
A brake Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough .
For the supporters of the project is ' the new heart of Europe ' .
Just as well . S21 is much more than that tieferlegen of a bahnhofs , more than a monströses works , that the city of baden-württembergischen capital for a decade in utter baustellenchaos will fall .
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980 's .
Kopfbahnhöfe with tracks in the middle of the city , which were then end up as verkehrstechnische fossils of the nineteenth century , the as bremsklötze appeared to have a modern rail transport , as it once did a great deal of time , of putting forward umzuspannen locomotives .
, brief , continue to drive ´ s reality is .
And that is why the kopfbahnhöfe should disappear : in Frankfurt and Munich .
And in Stuttgart : a durchfahrtsbahnhof - some rules half-way through the trans-European schienen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava is - and that is why the slogan ' the heart of Europe ' .
S21 will now actually addressed , although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with reality .
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen almost unaffordable and the Bavarian city , is to implement the tieferlegen .
However , kopfbahnhöfe have no one and ausfahrtsproblem more , since it modern wendezüge with locomotives and steuerwagen at both ends .
Nevertheless , Stuttgart 21 and the ice-neubaustrecke after Ulm is being addressed .
And local politicians have won .
The railways , power and also because the risks of the largest infrastruktur-einzelprojekts the Republic of the taxpayer and not the staatskonzern .
The project is still städtebaulich cannot be reasonably justified .
It will create new stadtraum , which - if we are to believe the computergenerierten tables illustrating the planners - will be equipped with a great deal of green .
For the transport system rail is s21 harmful .
The durchgangsbahnhof and the streckenausbau are intended for passenger transport , the one - typical 1980s - huge growth zuschrieb .
At that time there was not yet the competition of the low-cost carriers .
But first of all modern transport policy must be to strengthen the goods , because of the transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads .
But the neubaustrecke because of intense steigungen is not for freight trains .
Even more serious is that s21 also many other bahnprojekte indirectly affected .
Good six billion euros are schwäbischen are buried .
That is the official number .
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic .
It is a fact that , in the next decade , the money to other hubs and engstellen in the network .
A total of sixty larger projects , are on the list of the Department of transportation .
One of the most important is the development of good 180 kilometres long line through the Rhine valley .
Since 1987 , built on the route in the zeitlupentempo .
This right is so desperately needed , on the tube .
But s21 will act as a brake .
The rheintalstrecke will be the real bottleneck for international freight transport , right in the heart of Europe .
Government considers verdict on the airport
The provincial government has left open in the wiesbadener landtag , whether against the judgment of the hessischen verwaltungsgerichtshofs ( vgh ) to banning night flights in revision .
The CDU / fdp-koalition experts have asked about the more than 400 pages full vgh-urteil legally to examine said Minister for Economic Affairs , Dieter posch ( FDP ) .
The vgh in Kassel asked on these days in writing that the country in the case of the construction of the planned nordwest-landebahn at Frankfurt airport that new rules should prohibit them .
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m. , as it provides for the provincial government could not be provided with the legal protection of the population against noise night flights .
The coalition is to 4 January decide whether against the judgment in revision .
The opposition criticised this postponement and drive to the representatives of the government , on a revision of the bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig .
Spd-fraktionschef torsten schäfer-gümbel demanded CDU and free democratic party to come back to your before the election promises made to return to a ban on night flights , or is it as ' breach " .
It is hellishly difficult when you must keep its word , said grünen-chef Tarek al-wazir in reference to the fdp-wahlslogan " We believe that word ' .
Minister posch indicated the accusation of schäfer-gümbel back , the provincial government attempts , with ' rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand " still to come to their night flights .
A precise legal examination need your time .
The coalition did not want to be on the basis of a ' rapid first impression . "
We need a legally secure entscheiung , said Stephen Müller ( FDP ) .
So , as you the opposition , the statements of his group had never been to banning night flights .
US banks figures aid back
The troubled US behemoths swath of their state shackles .
The Bank of America has on Wednesday the aid from the bankenrettungsfonds TARP amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars ( good EUR 30 billion ) , at a stroke , repaid .
And also the Citigroup plans after a report of the us-senders cnbc , the state aid they pay .

The Bank of America was happy for convertible loans good 19 billion dollars fresh money concerned with investors .
The rest of the amount paid out of their own , which , among other things , was filled by spartenverkäufe well .
Bankchef Kenneth Lewis said on Wednesday evening thanks to the American taxpayers : the injection of money have helped on a very difficult time .
The geldhaus was at the height of the financial crisis with the adoption of the investment bank Merrill Lynch verhoben .
The Citigroup wants to free themselves from their liabilities vis-à-vis the state also money in capital markets .
On Thursday , the us-bank a around 20 billion dollars in increasing its capital , announce reported cnbc invoking circles .
A citigroup-sprecher did not .

Rapid election
It was then faster than we thought .
Barely two weeks after the zdf-verwaltungsrat the editor-in-chief Nicholas brender had pushed out of the station , can present a successor .
Yesterday evening the Committee on the personalie wanted to vote .
Peter Frey was the favourite , head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios in Berlin .
There was a confirmation from the sender for this , however , does not officially - not to anticipate the procedure .
Nevertheless , have also played a role , the zdf-intendanten Markus schächter no further damage to the management board , this proposal should not be allowed to succeed .
Frey , schächters candidate , needs the support of nine of the 14 gremiummitglieder .
The result of the vote was not yet in redaktionsschluss this expenditure .
Two weeks ago schächter with his proposal , the Treaty with Nicholas brender to extend for a further five years , in the management board failed .
Only seven Members have argued for brender , seven voted against it . Brenders such a heavy defeat for schächter was , however , a erwartbare .
Because the unionsmehrheit in the management board had already weeks before the election brender signals , not to want to confirm in office .
The opposition had organised against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Cook Orlando .
With the argument that the news of brender would have lost on ZDF ratings , has refused to accept a further term of the highly-regarded chefredakteurs .
Until just before the election , there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated .
Finally , 35 staatsrechtler interfered in the debate that this approach to be reexamined chefs as unconstitutional .
Nothing came of it .
The person
Peter Frey on 4 August was born in bingen in 1957 .
It was a policy , education and romanistik .
Later , he worked in the südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau .
On ZDF Frey changed in 1983 , firstly on the ' heute-journal ' .
Subsequent phases : 1988 until 1990 personal spoke of the chefredakteurs ; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington ; until 1998 head and host of the ' morgenmagazins ' ; to 2001 , head of the zdf-außenpolitik head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios ; since then .
The Greens have announced for the elimination brenders , on Wednesday , nor the branchenblatt medium for magazine journalists of the year was elected , a verfassungsklage .
Chefs adversary in the board of directors , the rheinland-pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck , said in the last week , the countries in the zdf-staatsvertrag should that personalvorschläge of intendanten not by a politically motivated majority can be blocked .
A withdrawal of parteipolitikern from the supervisory bodies , but also the ZDF Beck .
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had the management board with a wise move recommended by the body - immediately after the brender-abwahl sharply criticized for it .
Thanks to this belegs journalistischer independence , both schächter him without loss of face for the post of chefredakteurs nominate and choose the management board , without the suspicion , a partisan in order to lever into office .
In the parteiarithmetik Frey will , in any case , the liberal left-wing .
Studies will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students : after a year of bildungsstreiks drew the culture ministers of the countries on Thursday at long last , at a meeting of kultusminister- and hochschulrektorenkonferenz both sides agreed to in the studienbedingungen bachelor and master attempt to improve .
The students should be able to handle their studies .
In particular , it is important to reduce , the prüfungsbelastungen : in principle , each studienmodul only with a single audit .
In addition , the workload of the students ' should be reviewed and a realistic and acceptable level ' .
Politics and universities are also the recognition of prüfungsleistungen between universities within and outside of Germany .
The countries committed themselves to common strukturvorgaben for bachelor- masters and more flexible .
It is different länderregelungen , moreover , does not exist .
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June uni-rektoren culture ministers and bear the saying of the better studierbarkeit in the mouth .
For the first time , it has now been filled with a specific content .
The so-called akkreditierungsrat decided that the number of tests to be drastically reduced in part : ' every modul includes within the rule , with only a review after ' , it says , in a 30-seiten-papier , the authorisation of courses in part to new rules .
With the ' significant reduction in prüfungslast ' , said the akkreditierungsrat-vorsitzende Reinhold fairy tale , a " trend should be stopped , which was considerably studierbarkeit . "
Moreover , the ' studierbarkeit ' in the future , " the criterion ' in shaping .
Modules as content are " strictly checking " whether " unnecessary einengungen of students in the choice of
Events " would be avoided .
The students had " claim that room for manoeuvre , the initiative to maintain and promote ' .
The rules are to apply in relation to the authorisation of new , but also in the review of existing courses .
This must all five years ' reakkreditiert ' – which means that , by 2015 , it takes up all courses have been reviewed .
Bundesweit ten akkreditierungsagenturen are responsible for this , which has been set up by the countries akkreditierungsrat .
The Culture Ministers had the countries ' " in October , with emphasis on the agencies to make sure that the stofffülle not too big and the prüfungsregime is not too strict .
In individual Länder , universities and colleges with the landesministerien already agreed on appropriate measures .
As has been said in one country Rheinland-Pfalz for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds .
Of the money is to set up tutorenprogramme above all the universities and studienberatung and audit and auslandsämter strengths .
Country and universities will ten million euros .
At the beginning of 2010 the government wants to an amendment of the hochschulgesetzes submit to Parliament .
After this , for the conclusion of a studienmodells only one examination be necessary .
The studiengestaltung should be more flexible , in addition to the recognition of leistungsnachweisen to other universities and guaranteed access to master easier .
By the end of next year are all courses of the country on its studierbarkeit be reviewed .
The government and the opposition had once again on Thursday on the studienbedingungen dispute in the country .
In addition to praise , though , there was also criticism of the decisions taken .
The bundesvorstand the juso-hochschulgruppen called for the organisation of education policy should in future no longer be " behind closed doors ' of the Minister and hochschulrektoren .
At the latest , after the bildungsstreiks should now also the students and a say too ' concerned ' .
The future graduates support received by the President of the hochschulrektorenkonferenz ( hrk ) , Margaret wintermantel : " We have the experience of the students ' , said it on Thursday , at a meeting with the culture , with which the hrk on a common reform paper was discussed .
The trade union education and science ( gew ) , the Bonn Agreement as a whole does not go far enough : it is calling for a legal right , of any graduates with a bachelor-abschluss access to a secondary Masters Course . '
On the other hand , the countries must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor-studierenden tomorrow with the best possible studienbedingungen sufficient masterstudienplätze available , so gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar .
The countries must be much more teachers .
Freer access to the master , were not , however , the ministers for education .
More than a footnote to herta Müller
In Germany and in turn is good almost no control ... ' is the anfangszeile of a gedichts of lyrikers Werner söllner , in which this in troubling sprachfetzen the ankunftserfahrung of dissidents , addressed the freedom won , but at the same time , has lost its language area .
The 1951 in the Romanian banat Werner söllner was born as a first - speaking German and englischlehrer in Bucharest and later than lektor worked in a kinderbuchverlag before it in Frankfurt am Main übersiedelte in 1982 .
Söllner with various literaturpreisen has been excellent , in 1993 poetikvorlesungen kept the legendary in Frankfurt on the goethe-universität , and since 2002 , it has , head of the hessischen literaturforums in mousonturm in Frankfurt .
For major außerliterarisches of sensation , he last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich , with the " German literature in Romania in the mirror and zerrspiegel their securitateakten ' .
Read söllner visibly confused and move a statement , in which he schriftstellerkollegen rumäniendeutschen , including Mr Wagner , William totok , Franz hodjak , and Helmuth frauendorfer , his cooperation than in for the Romanian Intelligence Securitate acknowledging .
Together with some of those present söllner had received the German sprachpreis in 1989 .
The anwerbungsversuche would gradually begun in 1971 , first .
I am , therefore , söllner someone who is not enough against intimidation of the Securitate . "
The poet Werner söllner is in the Walter .
Almost at the same time with the nobelpreisehrung for herta Müller and whose unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule are the literaturszene and , in particular , the Community of German authors who hail from Romania shaken by a case , of the throes and the cowardice of a political system which mark on monitoring and domestic spying is based .
Mr söllner is , so far , according to bisherigem knowledge can say , not only perpetrators , but they are also the victims .
In its securitate-akte have played a role in the Walter said after the confession söllners the literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel for him and referred to the positive influence of the Walter .
He received it in all sensitive points for him at the time , " " herausgehauen Markel .
It is a moral necessity , this remark to make .
Söllners declaration was in the form and before this audience , unexpectedly , as a complete surprise is the affirmation of a former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence , however .
Germany is the sole preserve of post-candlelight for securitate-spitzel , had already been herta Müller in July at the time , having their own acts , 914 sides , had read .
The people concerned , there should be , and in some respects case speculation may also have known what klarname behind the decknamen sorin , voicu and even Walter verbarg .
Unlike the intensified now very verfahrenssicheren review of the stasi-akten , dealing with the legacy of the securitate-überwachung still very vague .
A systematic information is thwarted in recent years and has been hampered .
One of the birthler-behörde equivalent National Council for processing the securitate-akten ( cnsas ) was set up until 1999 , however , since then the file has been rather slow .
Only since 2005 , there is a law that the administration of the files .
The influence of former securitate-mitglieder in Romania is still very great , documented after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for herta Müller an interview , in which a previous securitate-chef from temesvar dismissive about the prizewinner advice .
They have a climate , finally , it is even interrogated .
The scandal of power said quite openly here in the form of freedom of expression .
Certainly in the case söllner link , as so often in connection with verschwiegener fault , unavoidable questions .
Why has it taken so long ? who has suffered the zuhörenden ? the measured response to söllners commitment suggests that the continuation of this chapter of urge rather than of blame and shame will be determined .
On the genese of herta Müller , who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday , it is more than a footnote .
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if there is a adrett gekleideter außendienstler of a very nice weihnachtsfeier on which a sports goods manufacturers goodies was distributed , as the new vfb-trainer Christian Gross appeared in the company of a Orange plastiktüte a quarter of the ausrüsters after midnight in a herbeigerufene ¨ c-klasse rose .
The man with the enormous glatze , for its chauffieren still foreign city .
Otherwise , they themselves should be able to travel - alcohol was not in the game , and besoffen before luck was the 55-jährige nor .
It was a pleasant evening , but tomorrow is the work on .
Or will not get .
In the words of the only three days earlier schweizers committed : ' we have achieved the achtelfinale ' , namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3 : 1-erfolgs against unirea urziceni from Romania , " but we should not be fooled by the success : it will be a brutal hard fight against the debasement . "
The " much more important task on Sunday " before .
Then there is the königsklassen-leistung in Mainz , in liga-alltag again .
And the very once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by marica ( 5 ) , träsch ( 8 ) and pogrebnyak ( 11 ) .
To appoint
The achtelfinale the Champions League ( hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March ) , on 18 December in nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers .
The joy at the start of the babbel-nachfolgers fulminanten behaviour was up .
Not only with regard to the supposed saviours , of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence , dedication and spielfreude had given .
I have received on the players and have told you that they should reflect on its strengths , and they have to be stopped , courageous , declared the gross seelenklempner sounding as simple as the recipe for success , but babbel under therapeut had had no effect more .
It has a kind of magic , were to lehmann Jens babbel-befürworter if in football , ' a new impetus , things sometimes happen , we would not have thought possible . '
And Sami khedira , after a verletzungspause thanks to its dynamism go straight to the best players , tried to place in the ' phenomenon " with the proverbial " fresh wind ' and the functioning of the new superiors : " He is a man of action and discipline .
That is what we need in the current situation ' .
Under babbel it had apparently been lacking .
The vfb Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods , warns sportvorstand Horst heldt
The vfb Stuttgart needs but , above all , consistent .
As well as gross were very careful not to players and managers , the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely überforderte überzubewerten in defence of the Romanian guests .
They have also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen 0 : 4 in the wake khedira came , was to take account of that .
And sportvorstand Horst heldt reminded that , although a saisonziel have been achieved , the other is still far off .
We are not yet out of the woods .
That heldt to its 40th anniversary even after the first heimsieg for three months after much like celebrating was not , was due to the events of this weekend , in the form of a just before spielbeginn fernseh-interviews broadcast by torhüter Jens lehmann fresh auflebten .
There are decisions , the other meetings and not the Jens , heldt lehmanns countered by the harsh criticism .
The board of directors of the had been accused of führungsschwäche and the trainerwechsel have decided to put pressure pubertierender fans .
That also be free day that had been withdrawn , wertete lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and will be .
Lehmanns statements are " of pure egotism " , keilte heldt , vowing consequences for the schlussmann .
They are no friends for life more , the two forty .
After all , but did you with all other agree that , without the preparatory work by the abgelöste trainerteam the spielerisch and aggressive strong idea would not have been possible .
Babbel and his assistants had " a large proportion of the success ' , said heldt in unison and lehmann - and also the man with the plastiktüte agreed .
The emphasis wm-fight
They hitziges in Bern : continually provoked challengers Kevin Johnson world champion of Vitaly klitschko with words and gestures .
But after twelve hard rounds of Ukrainians defended its schwergewichts-titel after version of the wbc .
The judgment of the judges argue fell from unanimously .
Hamburg , Vitaly klitschko remains box-weltmeister in emphasis .
The 38-jährige champion after version of the association wbc defeated in the night of Saturday in Bern the Americans Kevin Johnson unanimously after points ( 120 , 108 , 119 , 120 , 108 , 109 ) .
For klitschko , it was the third successful titelverteidigung after his comeback in October 2008 .
The Ukrainians was twice before world champion of the associations and wbc wbo .
Unfortunately , the k.o. that all expected , have not worked .
Klitschko built his track record in 39 victories in 41 profi-kämpfen twice that he had to take on the basis of violations surrender .
Challengers Johnson was therefore a 24 fight the first defeat .
Some 17,000 viewers in the Berne arena much 2,02 wanted to take the fight against all klitschko with his left führungshand dictate .
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson , before the end of the klitschko-ära they had announced , turned away from but always the blows of the weltmeisters , so that klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial objective could bring .
In fact the passive Johnson too little for a defiant and sought only get by on that .
Although he provoked klitschko with words and gestures , its blows met the world champions but rarely .
He is , after all , only the second Boxer after Timo hoffmann in the year 2000 , with klitschko on the full period of twelve round .
The challenger , before the fight in the Swiss capital for some .
It klitschko outraged as ' ugly Zombie " , the " right " .
The weight of the champion was that Friday to provoke the sonnenbrille , Johnson by the nose , schubsen , " in order to be able to see its eyes . "
Fourth victory for klitschkos comeback

After nearly four years time out at that time , he had the Nigerians Samuel Peter in Berlin and beaten back wbc-gürtel " his " , which he had previously made without a struggle .
He then defeated in this year in its titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris arreola from the United States .
I have in this fight only a blow abbekommen and am physically very well in form , had klitschko the rapid return to the ring .
His dream , but the unification of all four important title in the family .

Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition : grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin , Secretary of Defense guttenberg because of the incorrect information on the kunduz-affäre described as a liar .
The Social Democrats and left sought explanations of the German Chancellor .
HAMBURG / Berlin - according to the latest information on the bombing of kunduz karl-theodor Defence Minister , the opposition has to guttenberg ( CSU ) a deliberate deception .

Traumwelten
Some see in wachem state images and hear voices , the others do not see or hear .
Not only in mental health and in the drogenrausch blurring the borders between imagination and reality .
As long as it happens in sleep , everything is in order .
If we with eyes closed in our dark chambers , let us likes the wildest ideas and phantasiegebilden indulge in .
For those , however , who in the wachsein traumartige conditions saw things , and to the others do not see or hear applies in the modern Western world drogensüchtig mostly as crazy or , at least , as a sonderling .
But such images and vote in not only in the drogenrausch or mentally ill .
Blame our imagination : the same neuronalen processes that will enable us to draw up houses to images of Ireland or fine novels , sometimes to write that the borders between dream fantasy and reality are becoming increasingly blurred .
Traumartig modified wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in all sorts of ways , in the best case scenario we call them visions , in the worst case madness .
Even if a distinction may cause and effect , the vision of the mystikerin hildegard of bingen , the drogenerlebnisse of new-age-propheten Carlos castaneda , schamanische entrückungszustände , psychoses and hallucinations but on similar processes .
Hallucinations or delusions arise if the balance of the neuronalen botenstoffe of the brain - and above all , dopamin noradrenaline , serotonin and acetylcholin - derailing and the interaction of different gehirnteile is disrupted .
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte ideas are very often during a schizophrenic climate .
The gravity more about it has no power
The context of delusion and dream , philosophers and doctors since ancient times .
Aristotle term hallucinations as a form of dreams in the monitoring of state , Wilhelm griesinger , one of the founder of the modern psychiatry , noted 1861 a " great similarity of the irreseins with traumzuständen ' , for Sigmund Freud was the dream is ' a climate , with all the inconsistencies , wahnbildungen , sinnestäuschungen such a " .
It is autumn 2001 , when Henning T. in a comicfigur .
His body is developed along two dimensions and quietschbunt .
The gravity has no power more on him , he is hanging in the zimmerdecke .
It is a deeply felt .
Teufelsgestalten behind him saying with blutroten , distorted fratzen , zähnefletschend .
They do it , are stiefeln it with serious , flammenden , let him against the walls , he feels the pain to the entire body .
Dröhnen noisy , malicious vote from walls and radio .
He can no longer bear the voices that it to them .
T. Henning tackles two cable from the stereo , knotet and consolidating a noose at one snags ceiling .
It is rising at a loudspeakers and sets out the noose around the neck .
( FR ) .
The noose does .
This should be a lesson to you , at the vote in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir , ' walk in the hospital and let you cure . "
Today , Henning T. 40 years old , he has seen six acute psychoses , the last is 2 years ago , the first almost 20 years .
It has been triggered by LSD .
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoide climate , it is also manisch-depressiv , he approved medicines , against the depression , the obsession with , the schizophrenia .
He has learned , with his illness , for three years now , he married .
In the climate of fear and I have seen the worst of the deepest despair , he says .
The mere empty words are cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population illness at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia , in psychiatric hospitals , such a second most disease after the depression .
In an emergency schizophrenic climate mostly affected can no longer distinction between internal and external world , resulting in a state of übererregten to hallucinations , scale , relationships or verfolgungswahn can lead .
This is particularly widespread - stimmenhören vote or dialogisieren , comment on the orders .
Also optical hallucinations are not infrequently .
The importance of unwichtigem no longer able to separate the brain , can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals the awareness is swamped by impression .
As the dream of the climate also opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies , the deeper bewusstseinsschichten come from .
In the climate of the realitätswahrnehmung is subjektzentriert , says Professor Thomas Fox , oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg .
The schizophrenia is located in the centre of the event , everything has its importance to him .
At the same time , it is in a passive role , it will , as happens in the dream , of the events you not overwhelmed and can actively shape .
Therefore often schizophrenic feel threatened , monitored and manipulated .
A realitätsabgleich generally have is not possible , the mere empty words are cruel reality , to wake up .
Once in a lifetime to have seen a halluzination
Unlike in the dream , says Fox , " but the sinnliche and geographical structure of reality that is perceived in the climate , basically . "
The wahnhaften idea and hallucinations were built in the reality , the verfremdung of erlebens will take place in real terms .
Why exactly our brains antics proposes researchers , is still a mystery .
Ausnahmezustände in every person can mean that he loses the unrealistic , briefly , says Fox .
But not everyone will develop a climate .
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the only decisive factors .
Researchers are assuming that the minimal brain damage .
We suspect that the neuronale maturing of brain at an early stage of development will be disrupted by a virus , the mother during pregnancy , for example , Fox explained .
But there remain a mystery how the disruption of the neuronalen system is developed , and first of all manifestiere over many years .
Also environmental factors play a role , stress or traumatic experiences can be the catalyst for a climate , if the choice is there .
Halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychoses , as they are in the transmittersystem intervention .
If our brains is hotly
It is crazy , psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines , in order to get rid of them , others are spending money on drugs , which , according to the lübecker psychologieprofessor Erich castes .
Whether mere empty words as a pleasant or unpleasant , is often only a question of the position .
For ten years can collect castes reports on hallucinations and trugerscheinungen , last year , it results in his book ' The unreal world in our head ' evaluated .
Hallucinations are , of course , to the typical effects of psychoses , but also of surprising many other diseases .
These include mental disorders , such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , or Alzheimer 's disease and schädelhirntraumata .
Surprisingly , under certain conditions halluziniert even the brain healthy people .
Hallucinations , so castes , consists of gedächtnisinhalten together , which normally be withheld .
They are , if hirnareale , in which sinneswahrnehmungen processed or too little , überaktiv hampered ; if our brains hot , or , if there is no stimulation .
This state of affairs can trigger drugs as well as brain damage or a climate .
But it is also reizentzug , stress , liebeskummer or other mental ausnahmezustände .
Recent studies were up to one third of those polled said , at least once in their lives to have seen a halluzination .
In the summer of 2005 , Sarah K. 16 years old , they live in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the secondary schools there .
In fact , a perfectly normal girls .
If we did not have the images and votes .
In the break it can happen that a schlaksiger young with long dark hair it addresses .
If he replies - look at the mitschüler it surprised to see or hear - no one else these young .
They believe that this timid girls for a versponnene tagträumerin Sarah K. dreams , but not , it knows it .
It is , you can see or hear these young , just as the girls in the Bank alongside can see or hear .
They can even its presence felt , at least for moments .
A pleasant feeling is that it is the young .
I am mad ? , they are sometimes .
But it is known that the young and the others are real and is not mere empty words disappear again .
The most worrying phenomena are at night
The mere empty words are often also a burden .
If you are sitting in the klassenraum , it can sometimes unterrichtsstoff not consequences , because the teachers in their eyes and ears just a new mitschüler , while he presents for all other radio and visible in the bar of mathematical equations explained .
The most worrying phenomena are at night .
If you in their dark room to sleep , waiting for the far too little and too late , it can often do not distinguish awake , whether it is or already is dreaming , whether the pictures they see the fratzen or the girl with the bleeding schnittwunden on arms and legs , before their open or closed eyes .
Let me , in peace cries out to you the figures .
Parents and friends told you that they would not benefit insane .
Autumn 2009 . Sarah K. is now 20 years old .
It has in the past year the baccalaureate were and live with their friend .
A year ago , the hallucinations stopped .
Since you on the Internet , to contact the psychologists caste has included , you know perfectly well that it is crazy .
Madness is also a work of art of Despair
If someone socially isolated or under reizentzug is highly likely , he has , after a while hallucinations , says castes .
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and provides even for his entertainment .
Sarah K. , a einzelkind , had a little girl fear of other children , often , she played alone .
When you began your hallucinations with 13 learned that the man that you , since you are thinking of Papa calls , not its leiblicher father .
Since on visual and acoustic hallucinations the same hirnbereiche active , are the real impressions and sound , it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish and reality , mere empty words . " every " castes , says , ' will take place in the brain , the reality is taking place there .
Hallucinations are also images , which lead to the brain , so they act as real . "
At traumbilder also takes stock of caste as a form of halluzination .
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from which an acute climate .
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation , as unreal to see its mere empty words .
Castes advises his patients , therefore , also as a special ability wertzuschätzen hallucinations .
Grenzzustand between the dream and halluzination
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world will see imaginäres unfortunately often says , pathologisiert Michael schmidt-degenhard , Professor in Heidelberg and chefarzt the clinic of psychiatric and psychotherapy of florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf .
A climate is a terrible , tragic disease , but it also has positive , creative - madness is also an expression of desperation .
The so-called oneiroide erlebnisform has schmidt-degenhard researched , a special form of traumartig modified wachbewusstseins .
Oneiroide are hochkomplexe , detailed quasi-träume , the erlebende for real and he also does not subsequently can distinguish between the wachzustand .
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand is emerging in trauma- or krankheitsbedingten situations , for example in polyradikulitis-patienten , in full awareness of a motor paralysis .
If a person of self- and weltverlust is under threat , for example by continuing total impotence , it replaces the life-threatening reality by its own , imagined world which is detached from reality , says schmidt-degenhard .
A kind of grenzzustand between the dream and halluzination .
Since the completion of a situation that is not possible , in reality , a weltwechsel , the reality , but in the imagination .
An intensive form of sinnstiftung and meaning in a precarious situation , which allows us gestaltungsfähigkeit their own people , not in a nothing of the bewusstseinsverlustes sink .
Everything is real , later in the memory
The art also devoted its oneiroid-erlebnisse Peter Cornelius claussen describes in his book ' herzwechsel ' as a bailout of the soul .
It is 49 years old when his conscience after a herzklappenoperation , followed by a herztransplantation posted on travel , while his body in critical care to maintaining is condemned .
Claussen in a selbstgeschaffene world , a visiting foreign time and place : it is seen as a bettlägerigen , old man , on board a zugsanatoriums , a robot guards his health .
He is living in the early Middle Ages under Royal , the drugs from blood .
It is a Greeks on motorcycle in its own country , surft with his spitalbett abducted in firnschnee the Alps and applies a Korean mafioso .
It is entirely to happen in the imaginierten , everything is real , later in the memory .
These internal travel for claussen differ fundamentally from any dream .
Dream is another state , be it describes .
Quite the contrary , I think that the memories of mental travel even after years and in secondary details abundantly clear .
Even clearer and more intensive than really erlebtes .
The intensity of the erlebens goes far beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience , says the psychiatrists schmidt-degenhard .
At the end of the oneiroide show , psychoses , hallucinations and drogenrausch how fragile our internal abbilder in monitoring the external reality .
Any change in the bewusstseinszustandes , summed the psychologist castes , " can lead to a verformung of what we call a reality . '
An experience which may also be enriching .
The schneeeinbruch can come
Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new verlagschef kallen is an interim solution would be that in the long term , Hubert burda companies in the hands of his two children , he said the mirror .
The holding should also in future to 100 % of the family .
HAMBURG - the publishers Hubert burda provides for companies in the long term , be in the hands of children .
Both children heirs of 27 years ago and have the firm desire to enter into companies , said the 69-jährige the mirror .
The details of this , we have taken the precaution of regulated .
The question of whether they are active in companies is not until then .
The question of whether they are able to do so .
We cannot swallow 7 500 staff his children , if it is not enough .
This brings the children and the companies too .
On Thursday burda had announced that he will withdraw from January by the company ’ s , and paul-bernhard kallen appointed to his successor .
The 52-jährige kallen is in a burda since 1999 .
First of all , he was responsible for technology .
Later , with the area Treasury the responsibility for the unternehmensvermögen this and following the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer for direct marketing and abroad , pressure and finances .
For the first time is not a family member at the head of the verlages .
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old , his son Felix , today , 42 years old , died a few years ago .
The appointment of kallen also serve to " 10 to 15 years ' , so burda to bridge .
The holding should continue to 100 % of the family , said burda .
With regard to the cases schickedanz and schaeffler spoke burda that family businesses are not safe from disaster : " that was always families who have contracted by a kapitalsucht that have verspekuliert and felt that they could become a major player .
It never was my strategy .
He has never had weltmachtträume ' , so burda ' .
I am not as the political präzeptor Springer this country , as it was , and I do not want to a global player with ' time ' , these shops are too great .
The promises of fonpeek
Äuβerst peek is limited , a device , which can only be read his e-mails , without an opportunity to be able to see certain annexes or be able to surf the Internet .
It has enjoyed glory his five minutes , as it the magazine time one of the products of the year .
It is on the straβe , is unlikely to see the idea in itself , but is , nonetheless , especially for young people of interest .
In contrast to the smartphones peek costs very little and has a very favourable unmetered access , for example , only half the price of unmetered access of iPhone .
After the company that has seen the success it has two new products on the market , one that is intended only for Twitter , the other with a lifelong gratisservice for data , unlike the peek six times in which we must pay a higher price .
Fonpeek that yesterday , in the event of Le web is the European version of this invention and thus its third version .
It has the same borders , as his American counterpart , has , however , come as a surprise .
The monthly unterhaltspreis on the telephone , approximately EUR 12 per month , contains roaming for the whole of Europe .
Those who , with a smartphone travel around the world , already know what it means to give up all the data in order to be able to read his emails , as soon as they cross the border , or if you are desperate for a café with WiFi addiction ( or a verbindungsmöglichkeit with fon ) .
The idea of the roaming with unmetered access is incredibly tempting and should in fact be possible for a long time .
It is true that some of their objections specific treaties already provide for auslandsaufenthalte and prices , but in my experience it is already a doctorate in physics and a good glasses , in order to be able to read the small print .
The repeated criticism by the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming prices for the whole of Europe , have remained almost always .
Auβerhalb of their own country has always been afraid to read his emails , and rightly so .
A small equipment such as fonpeek ( although it time and again , it is amazing that the name fon , although it has no WiFi / wlan has ) this type of tariffs can offer , means that the their objections slowly but surely have to begin to rethink and in various ways to consider how they can use the Internet .
Kindle is another good example , in its prices is the downloaded of books and further questions on the Internet .
Without vetrag and without snags .
This is a internetfähiges equipment and we do so only once , namely in acquisition , and not month by month .
And that is what I expect from fonpeek one day , a kaufmöglichkeit with lifelong Internet access as the peek already in the US .
And this is not because I want to buy .
I read my emails on the telephone , thank you .
But I expect this , because I am of the opinion that it would be appropriate model for the consumer .
It would be interesting , at the same time , a computer system able to see .
The fetischfarbe of Michelle
The lieblingsfarbe yellow , is without doubt the American first lady .
Even in the case of the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States , they appeared in a dress and a mantle of the colour and has the same colour re-elected him in his , without doubt , the second most important moment in his life : to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo .
Michelle Obama has on two occasions : auβer borne very similar models that it is almost the same colour - was an outstanding grüngelb - was the clothing from three parts - clothing jacket and a veil from the same material- and , to that end , something groβförmig gesticktes or a halskette .
It even goes so far as to at first sight , it seemed that the first the United States the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion .
However , the two clothes differ very much in the stoffart , from which they are produced .
It was at the inauguration of a dress from head and in Oslo , including one from gemusterten .
The accessories were different : the first time Green shoes with halbhohen sections and the second time a änhliches model , but goldfarben .
The hair style was different : each time the hair , on this occasion , as haarkranz proposed under the previous , the hair open .
75 % of working mothers , because of their maternity problems in the get work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years , especially for the younger women who want to have children .
This result is the of csic in cooperation with the Institute for women study " fertility and career of women in Spain ' .
The survey of 9.737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it : 75 % of working women are your career are on the labour market due to their motherhood .
The study is open , that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children , depending on whether the women work or not , and if so , what kind of work .
Those of you who auβerhalb of the House do no other activities , only halbtags work or no fixed contract of employment , which is more likely to be mothers and have more children .
In contrast , the women postpone with a permanent jobs , particularly in the public sector , the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children .
" The women in people aged between 35 and 49 years with a permanent employment their first child on average only 3.7 years after the zusammenziehen , a number of 4.1 years for women with permanent employment increased took longer to achieve this and it zusammenziehen and the first child have implemented until much later .
Auβerdem the kind of work also has a groβen influence on motherhood , albeit less than the calendar for the empfängnisbereitschaft " , declared the csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado .
The level of education is a further factor , of the age of women in marriage and the first child must be taken into account .
According to the survey is the age at the time of the first child marriage and the higher , the higher the level of education .
This difference has also noted the same age .
For example , the women in the group between 35 and 49 years , depending on whether you only the completed or a higher education have , on average , each with 25,1 or 32,1 mother , for the first time .
Furthermore , there are still , depending on the level of education , which is also a difference between the women .
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss before your first get married and have their first child , make it the women with a medium-sized or high school exactly the other way round and seek out only a permanent employment and marry afterwards and then get their first child , is Delgado .

The journey is exciting and Vicent still erleuchtungen saves either to horror .

Cowardly aggression
My 70 years of mother was last week by our district in the town of fuenlabrada love , a group of young people between 15 and 18 years herliefen alongside their and our dog , our dog is a mischling that we have obtained at the and the just six kilos of substantial , and then they missed a bolt from the blue him two fußtritte and injured it so difficult .
Our indignation , one can never be in words , because it is incomprehensible to us , since the spass in a cheap aggression against a small and hilfloses animal should be , and it is obvious that it has been implemented in the leash .
Added to that is the erstickungsanfall , a woman who love comfortable , was the result of the incident you these people wanted to reprimands to others , they feared even for their own lives , because if such a wahnsinniger attacked a dog , he will be the same perhaps with a woman , a child , an elderly gentleman or possibly even with each , the weaker than it actually is .
The incident occurred in a normally calm districts at five o 'clock on an ordinary Tuesday afternoon .
The dog has geheult all day long .
We have , of course , in a nahgelegenen football intelligence unit reporting back to what we have grave doubts about whether that will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset , we would like to make it clear that only Spaniards were the cowardly criminals .
Our indignation about what has happened led us , this incident .
We cannot understand what in the minds of these young people that they must begin to a cheap attack on a hilfloses animal amusing to find an animal that we love , society and friendship .
We do not know where the good education and of respect for the animals and the people .

This initiative in order to draw attention to the importance of the helmgebrauchs , since it is , when it comes down to is that the only schutzelement clubbed to death or even in the event of a motorradunfalls can prevent .

The sale of kleinlastwagen something is rising again
After almost two years of kleintransporter discrepancies within the beginning of the , at long last , a little light at the end of the dark tunnel .
The 9.425 vehicles in November in Spain , have been allowed to mean an increase of 12.6 % in relation to the year 2008 , and , more importantly , they are so that the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months gemäβ decrease , keep going with the herstellerverband anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam figures presented .
However , these good figures are currently only with groβer to genieβen caution , because the other comparison used by November 2008 , which is a particularly bad verkausjahr with a reduction by 60 % on the previous year .
However , we must remember that , in addition to the increase in the last month , the gesamtzulassungen this 11 months still 40 % below the sale of the previous financial year .
Since January , as a whole , 95.853 vehicles sold in this number , but all vehicles , which is the kleintransportermarkt : descendants of passenger cars , pick-ups , kleintransporter , small vans and easier kleinlastwagen / chassis .
Furthermore , it is still the same storm clouds in the sky , what the demand in the most affected , because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals , is the groβteil of sales for small and medium-sized enterprises , which almost 100 % of all cases the purchase by a drittfinanzierung .
It is on these restrictions , which are the result of the zugedrehten geldhahns of credit institutions , with einschlieβen further factors , such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the continuation of the poor economic situation .
In this situation and , in contrast to the passenger cars , the financial aid for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000e little helped .
This plan is , however , not only for private individuals , including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that , if you are a kleintransporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a co2-ausstoss that does not exceed 160 grams per gefahrenen kilometres , wish to buy , but the low sales figures speak for themselves .
Just yesterday had ganvam again reminded us that it is needed by the state , is also a special attention to this kleinlaster , and , of course , on the industriefahrzeuge ( lorries and buses ) .
The autohändlervereinigung predicts a similar for 2010 as the just last year , for it with a verkaufsausfall ( for passenger cars and off-road vehicles ) by 19 % is calculated .
The support for bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was already the antiblockierbremssystem ( just now , and as has happened with the stability control control ( ESC must to slow down the hilfssysteme pflichtausstattung in emergency situations in the European cars .
In fact , they are already duty in all newly registered passenger cars and light kleintransportern , for the remaining vehicles , a karenzfrist set by the end of February 2011 .
The European Union has maβnahme decided to aim to improve the protection of the fuβgänger , however , these braking systems because of their working methods , many front-rear collisions could also help to prevent .
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers system , on the basis of the bremsstärke outlined by the drivers on the bremspedal recognises .
However , this system is exerting this pressure not to the end .
According to the komponentenhersteller for the bosch-fahrzeuge research , a third of the lorry drivers who are involved in an accident in the zusammenstoss not even more on the bremspedal , half of them had not slowed down with full force .
Up to 1 000 accidents
The bremshilfe attacks against with maximum strength in the braking by a and reduced the bremszeit and thus also the bremsabstand , a car in the bremsvorgang truck .
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1 000 fatal accidents , which fuβgänger harm to come , be avoided , if all cars equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten .
It would be even less accidents - it is calculated that every fourth accidents involving personal injury might be done - as soon as the so-called intelligent measures be popular .
It is a vehicle equipped with a system that ( on radar or a camera ) obstacles recognises and the drivers ' , while at the same time there is a very easy way of exerting pressure on the brakes .
Then , when the driver is helping him in the system , the pressure on the bremspedal , if it would be needed .
If the driver has not responded to the warning and even if the zusammenstoss already is unavoidable , does the bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes , so that the damage as far as possible .
General Motors defers the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the opel-werks in Figueruelas ( Zaragoza ) with Nick reilly , the new chairman of General Motors ( GM ) Europe , have been informed that the production of new Meriva will start in the first aprilwoche , probably on 8 , according to Mr Ortega , the American car manufacturers to indicate that it needs more time to the rescue plan for Opel to bring them to a conclusion .
Nick reilly , the new chairman of GM Europe , will in fact ensure that the political side to support every single point of the plan in advance .
And it is for this very reason , it may be that the final document , the first of the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works , is being put off until the beginning of 2010 .
Will dementgegen from GM assured us that in the next few days , a decision on selling Saab meeting .
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government to put pressure on the American industry has increased , so that this as soon as possible a decision .
GM admits , with some possible new buyers in touch .
One of these buyers could be geely , happy to Volvo , however , would like to buy up the option of the Dutch producer , the skyper-sportwagen by the Russian group converg backing has , ever stronger .
If it with any of these buyers should come to an agreement , could GM some assets to the Chinese baic sell .
The decision to schlieβen Saab at the end of the year , if it has not been sold by then , will also continue .
At the helm of the Porsche boxster spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive juwels engineers used the boxster 's as a basis and made it really has to him to make it easier for 80 kilograms and he is now only 1.275 kg to tip the balance .
In order to create something like this , the first thing you renunciation on the automatic aufklappbare roof , a zeltleinwanddach with manuellem impetus has been replaced , in order to be saved 21 kilo alone ; thanks to the aluminiumtüren used in this model as the of the gt3 ' disappeared ' further 15 ; by the exclusion of the air conditioning , 13 ; auβerdem one has the kraftstofftank of 64 to 54 litres of reduced in size , have been saved further 7 kilos ; with the installation of sporting bacquet-sitzen 12 again and again in the light 19-zoll-felgen five saved .
It was also due to the audio-system once again cdr-30 six kilos of less and the exchange of türgriffe by griffe achieved the lack of a kilo of substance .
Although he , too , with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available , the probefahrt with a car with 6-gängigen carried out handgetriebe , mainly on the smaller landstraβen of California , in bergstrecken , which really was very kurvig .
In his driving patterns , it can only be irreproachable ' .
The reduction of its weight , but not to geführtdass he is no longer so sure would be on the straβe .
Rather , the opposite is the case : since long have we no longer a small and light model probegefahren but at the same time , they also have a feeling of safety in the groβer graphs , even at high speed .
It is a small athlete , its muscle , with a low initiating the necessary time to warm , until we give him the orders to curb rasen to recover and then all over again from his engine to bring out ...
He is doing what he says . The car makes everything we him with our hands at the wheel indicate , thanks to its management , as well as accurately as kommunikativ .
And it makes it with the precision of surgeons .
A motorsound for all tastes
The sound of his v6 boxers with 320 PS ( 10 more than the boxster 's ) is very successful and it cannot yet with the ' sport ' -option and by means of a system that can change the motorgeräusche , which has already been used for the first time in the panamera .
The beschleunigungsvermögen is inconceivable brutal , whether from the face of the or speed up again .

Thank you very much !
After the verlockendsten days since last spring , in which the inflation of the assets of the prevailing mood in the markets , was on the markets is the uncertainty returned again , which in any case is surprising , since this is their natural state is , in a context in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future .
The stabilisation of the markets maβnahme it was applied , the debt with the direktkauf of assets and indirectly to settle the liquidity free hand in interest rates to be allowed to move the zero , so that in this way , totting up the banks to buy assets .
The central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets as well as closed , and , without their heterodox policies to liquidity , begin to spread puts the BCE , as has already näc vormachte with their jahresversteigerung , the next week .
That is why the question of investment in the ability of the world economy , the economic recovery without these heterodox maβnahmen alive and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums .
The flüchtigkeiten the stock exchanges and the differences in the unternehmensboni rise again , even if it is still a long way from the paranormalen amounts are you achieved at the beginning of the year .
The Member States have been forced to seek to nationalise the private risks and the national debt rise again .
It is now back on quality and the United States , Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors , which in turn will help to increase the differences in respect of the countries in the euro zone in Germany .
Spain has been hard hit by this episode of instability , but then came Standard & Poor 's and threatened with a new revision downwards about the evaluation of Spain .
On the other hand , not to a degree of uncertainty is damaging to the defenders of the moral risk to silence once again tried to those responsible for the weltwirtschaftspolitik an awareness , for what they have caused , since it the devastating effects , to which the restriction of credit , led to the loss of jobs , as they had slowed down a new day to dankesaktion beschlieβen should have .
Nevertheless , what happened in Dubai , on a stammeskrieg between the emiren governments to power in the Emirates and restore the development in Greece has also already been previously anticipated .
A government which does not mention the public debt , elections and a new government , which is on the same side .
Prodi made it in Italy , Mr Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso .
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary from the beginning of the year , the failure to meet their auslandszahlungen save and thus a euro-mitgliedsland gives no longer comply with its commitments .
However , it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and its citizens with regard to the need for auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with , the stability of public money .
Yes , we are as expected an episode of normalisation of risk premiums , after some ausschweifungen to large sums of money , and it would now within the expected .
In the case of Spain must be not to worry , as long as the differences of public debt , with the same speed as the European unternehmensboni .
Should the European differences and reduce the Spanish dannn would increase even further , it is a special Spanish risk action .
The Standard & Poor 's is a farce , while the local early indicators of marktforschungsinstitute a groβteil forcing their plans for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 , einschlieβlich tightening the ocde and of the European Commission , which once again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy of production , promises all this despite warnings no long life .
Once again , it appears that there will be an excellent opportunity for the purchase of Spanish stocks , although at the moment as regards driving " precautionary " is the order of the day .
