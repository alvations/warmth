The strategy of Republican Party against Obama ’ s reelection
Republican leaders justify their policies necessary to combat electoral fraud.
Brennan's centre, however, such a hoax calls for a myth that voter fraud is in the US is less common than the number of people who die after the lightning strike.
Republican lawyers for the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the democratic system.
Unlike Canada in the US have responsibility for the organisation of federal elections individual states.
And in this spirit of most American governments from 2009 a new laws, which make it difficult to process or writing to the electoral list.
This phenomenon was expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, it was only for the year 2011 for 180 of the law restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present identification with a photo ID and proof of the American citizenship.
Such laws also limit the period for elections in advance, zneplatňují right subscribe to the list of voters on election day and withdraw the electoral law citizens registration in criminal record.
Before the elections in 2006, did not require the submission of the electorate půkazu card with photographs no American state.
The first state that this requirement, the Indiana.
The constitutionality of indianského confirmed in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court.
Republican authorities hurried to the extension of the procedure, as well as other countries.
For the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states in order to coerce voters to submit their identity cards with pictures.
It should be noted that, unlike the Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as a health card.
In fact, stepmother 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged to vote, no identity card with photographs issued a government authority of their state.
Also does not have an identity card about five million new voters in 2012.
The purchase of the identity card, moreover, is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mostly young, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000; 18% of people aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years and therefore does not have the required identity card with photographs.
And that is not all.
The students, who are known as the electorate with its shift to democratic candidates are not in a number of Member States shall be authorised to use his identity card with photographs issued their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting or fishing clubs who opt for more Republican candidates, the cards issued these clubs in the elections.
In 2004 did not require no state election proof of citizenship.
The first such a request introduced Arizona.
From 2011 by a dozen state laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are obviously going to restrict the number of votes from Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer Democratic Party.
Republican legislators in 2011, supported in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day.
Instead, the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write.
Those restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004 underpinned a campaign for the registration of voters to register around 10 million people.
Measures taken following 2009 but has caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have laws aimed to shorten the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, even though the African American voters in this country was only 13%.
In Hispanic it as well.
They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other side of the white men who were 76% of all voters, they were only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance.
Against the laws that restrict the registration of voters, is, of course, very strongly built a democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic Governors blocked his veto a couple of bills.
With a view to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.
Part of the damage they have managed to limit.
For example, the law requiring the identity card with photographs by only 16 of 34 states.
The newly introduced rules, however, quite difficult in 2012 the exercise of the voting rights.
Democratic critics speak about bias approved laws, an apparent attempt to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states.
Report: Brennan's centres of 2011 shows that the States, where were these laws approved, represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes necessary for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say for sure that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: Today, these new provisions will have an adverse effect on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Undergo examinations or not?
PSA test brought sometimes erroneous results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to unnecessary medical emergencies.
All this has increased the reluctance of men who have been so reluctant to the examination of all go.
To investigate or not?
We asked for the view of two experts.
In studies performed in the US showed high levels of contamination between the test groups, it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
A further study, this time European, said different mortality among patients who underwent examination, and those who did not go to them.
The study also showed a after 12letém detachment that those who do not follow the examination, have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
I recommend examination of 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Are insecure group are also men with African origin.
The key is to take the right decision, when cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive cancers and such species, which are inert.
It is therefore necessary to patient level of the type of cancer, to offer him the alternatives, no cure necessarily prostate cancer, which is not in the long term impact on life, and focus in these cases rather on the active supervision of the disease.
Today, a number of men who had been diagnosed with cancer, as their kind of cancer is not aggressive, and threatens to life.
They propose rather implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression offering the treatment.
Increasingly, and with greater precision establishing criteria, which help in deciding which type of treatment and which not.
Yet, I therefore recommend screening.
It is important but go to an interview with the doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo testing or not.
In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created movement Movember tool that allows you to assess for and against in the context of PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite the advances in research seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all the healthy eating and sufficiently moved, it could be avoided by up to 30% of cancer cases.
"If all stop smoking, this figure would be increased to at least 50%," underscores the André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian company for cancer research.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance.
Some percentage of also remain unexplained.
For the Canadian company for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even if the number of smokers.
Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also risk factor for a few more.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," shakes his head spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker will quit, decreasing the risk of cancer deaths by half.
Weight
Stoutness and obesity are according to the SCC another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus and pancreas and womb.
"The research indicates that the regular physical activity throughout the life they protect against cancers of the colon," says the report.
Nutrition
The organization also recommended limit consumption of red meat.
At too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid and sausages, of which the same is true.
To preserve meat by salting, drying or may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to cells and lead to the development of cancer," says the report.
Vitamins
In recent times, the various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer.
However, research has revealed clear conclusions.
The study focused on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory.
Although one of them will be to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies talk more about his increase.
Even the effects of vitamin D in the cancer is not clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their fears and the precedent of the family doctor.
"To undergo testing does not mean that you have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
Notification of the likely discovery of the Higgs bosonu caused a stir last summer.
There is a view that this bosons are involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And also, for the last particle, which predicts the existence of the standard model - our best or at least "bad" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - which, however, has not been empirically observed.
Between the physics, though, there is not yet a 100 percent certainty, that the Higgs boson.
Nor is there doubt that we have at our disposal entirely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as foretold the standard model.
The new data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto it rather confirm missing, however, have all the information, so that we can have absolute certainty.
Suppose, however, that this is a Higgs boson, since the risk of error appears to be small, and look at what was happening.
In this world is quite definite law, according to which the two things cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be ignored - and not to try too hard, lest you hurt.
Although the particle physics very strange world, it turns out that she is a similar law: The Pauli exclusion principle according to which they two particles occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "condition" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
Further divided physicists particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently follow Pauli principles.
And at the other end of the range bosony, wretched anarchists who do not deserve nothing at all - not of this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to equipment (by the way perfectly wonderful), which is The Particle Adventure, laboratories, Berkeley: Mesony, here we go, and "force particles," which is a natural force, and with whom the Higgs boson probably related in some way.
However, it should be said that these bosony are not so exotic animals, as it would be to believe.
If this article you read, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or "particle of light", which is "a" electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when particles with an electric charge accelerate or change its direction, "write" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "intrusion" is the electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc) and this wave of is nothing more than the photon - and thus one of the bosonů, "of power."
More stable field
Nor is it with the Higgs bosonem, except that, "disturb" should be another field, the Higgs field, to be the boson.
This the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the excitation is necessary to achieve very high energy values, like in the frozen surface of the pond, which moves just a lot of a large boulder.
For this reason, it should be used as a part of the accelerator as accelerator in the laboratory CERN - Large Hadron Collider is friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field with us again to clarify the relationship between Higgsem and substance.
With the electromagnetic field do not respond or all particles or all of the materials.
Some, such as magnets, so do, but not other - a piece of paper, for example, will never be alone to keep in the fridge.
And so, with the Higgs field are not responding all particles: Those that do, have a certain matter, while others (such as the photon, look at him) do not have it.
And Mrs. Nováková asks why all these studies are "bring us?"
From the point of view of science is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between the observations and forecasts SM.
Many physicists, literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and to close some of the loopholes in the model.
It is to be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, there is no clarification of gravity (whoa!) or dark matter, which account for around 80% of the space matter (whoa!).
Device CERN until now, however, such contradictions.
Responses
These responses research in the everyday life of Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.
Look: At the beginning of the 1960s not pioneers laser at Bell Labs has no idea of the revolution, for their work.
They assumed the scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where he was the laser in 1960 invented, and that created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulse) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially considered a "toy in the lab."
Imagine that....
And besides, may be the result of all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during its operations to the optics.
The scanner, even if that Boyle at first as planned, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activity around the LHC will necessarily must change your life, but it means that you can never really know....
Palliative care - Best way to leave the life... | Le Devoir
By the Commission for the dying with dignity, Quebek recently engaged in an awkward questions about the end of life.
The debate should soon followed, and at the same time is about the bill.
In this crucial area remains to be done plenty of work.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr L. still alone in my apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a reprieve.
"Give me five years of life, and it was seven," says no emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, arriving on the previous day.
"But it is still shock, that you can prepare," he adds.
The disease had done their work: A vast makes it impossible for him to go alone to the bathroom or eat alone.
Resignation is looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees that will help him to eat.
It is a brave and even and smiles, speaks with the unknown, who was with him stop, brings him his medication, offer a bath.
Courage to a death.
"My dearest wish is to get rid of diarrhoea, this is me," she says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors on his problem lék.
"Throughout the life of one learns that the men urinate standing up," tells Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the installation Victor-Gadbois.
Return to the stage for some people in an intolerable humiliation.
"Depends on the ability of a man," whether the return to take, says psychologist.
In the view of many people who deal with palliative care, with crucial moments are taking place at the heart of this.
Patients who are stepping into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
The forecast is for up to three months to live.
At this stage of their team of doctors and nurses, who cared for them, so to speak, "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst concern to die on the "suffocation in full consciousness."
The disease but allow me to their children.
"I have a good kids," he adds.
"In my life I have no wish," he says, and then do, we breather.
Yet even to meet you in the days of the last visit son of Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers provides care of the body with the help of nutrition.
So it looks palliative care, which is, if not to do anything else.
That death was more comfortable.
In Quebec is a bed palliative care at 11 700 residents.
This is a very few, if we consider that all gonna die.
Life goes on in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martelová, one of the medics in the home.
Whether it is the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
When you die, you can give him, for example, sip brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics already does not have to watch the level of sugar.
And death there is part of everyday life.
Last night carrying beer Mr X, who later died in the night.
This morning beer finishes his son in honor of the late father.
"We are helping patients as well as their relatives," tells Nathalie Savard, director of the care services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois go days one after the other, but like each other.
Beside třiadevadesátiletého man, who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while his připíjejí in his honor, die tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children after tried all options to survive.
"For a year, there is always a three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer in 45 years," tells fearfully Dr. Christian Martelová.
53% of the patients in the home of Victor-Gadbois come, come from their homes, 47% of the hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering, once the sick to reach the final phase of his life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, they specialise more or less exclusively on the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to the fact that many doctors specialising in palliative care fears that the adoption of the Law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by the leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which the show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martelové is not a Quebec healthcare system is sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia.
As he says, has recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on alert in enormous pain without anyone done the necessary steps to relieved.
Afraid to ask patients about the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists takes care of its patients until the last moments without regard to the negative outlook.
Hope for survival Hélène Richardové have already been minimal, if left competitive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce that concludes with the treatment, said she regrets that I fight, tells us.
And they told me that it is over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who want to die, thanks to the treating physicians for their wishes recovery, when a team of palliative pussy ease the pain.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director for palliative care in the Society for domestic palliative care the Grand Montréal, patients from the treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by fits and starts, or whether he administered a sedative.
Unable to pretend that this part of the suffering we do not see eye to eye.
The patient, which escape the pain will have greater access to paliativním sedation.
Patients, which is not given a sedative, always the same: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me the euthanasia", this means, rather, "I want you to get rid of me pain."
The implementation of this story to grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in health care.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Administration officials, businessmen in construction and public works, the lobbyists of political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell, what do they know about a "system", in which the mingled construction, public officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia.
This "field" came Quebec taxpayers very expensive in particular between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system crumbled, since we have adopted fundamental measures," says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to him burst into 2011 scandal, on the basis of the consistency of the investigation centred on the embezzlement of funds in connection with the contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec that the liberal a Quebec Premier Jean Charest has approved only after long delays.
"Duchesneauova report confirmed" direct links between industry, opaque funding for parties and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "saved only by the Ministry of Transport on procurement billion dollars," when some people to check their instincts to get to share!
Charbonneauova Commission "has already led to the resignation of two mayors," he adds, with the hope that she can "to uncover the cunning of some of the people."
Permanent unit for combating corruption based in 2011
Permanent unit for combating corruption based in 2011 is also engaged in battle with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
Added to that police "Marteauovy company", who since 2009 ensured that the cartel "of Montreal penězovodů" considerably ease the inflating contracts.
In recent weeks by a number of inspections and have accused of fraud and corruption of municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one of the district from the suburbs.
Next on the list should be Gilles Vaillancourt, who resigned from his post as the mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest of the Quebec City.
It is suspected that repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public procurement contracts.
Formal charges have already received also traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lina Zambito.
Lina Zambito caused a sensation that, when the Commission said the "system" of public procurement.
He gave during these years of 3% of the value of the contracts, which in Montreal, vehicle associated with the Mafia, which then money transferring the Union Montréal, for which ran for mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was after the 2000 generous on all sides and paid more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 euros) a provincial parties, in particular, however, the liberals, who were then in power.
He copped to the fact that organized the illegal source of funds for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
Contracts with penězovody whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal, "system" corruption alert.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, it before the commission very described in detail: During the ten years he had received from the construction companies gifts, an invitation to trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, the hockey games and pocket money worth a total of $736 million in exchange for contracts with penězovody, in which nadsazoval price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that the remuneration paid for by 30% to 40% overestimate invoices through false víceprací.
Organizer mayor parties Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye that without embarrassment over his eyes with a budget that to his Treasury brought dirty money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which cast Montréal to massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými Members who have issued a warning signal.
As Mayor constituency Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island since 2010 calls against the sale of municipal property bought for $5 million, and sold at... 1.6 million promotérům directly in the middle of a thriving trade in real estate.
70% of laundering in electoral campaigns
The investigation, which will finally begin, says that "pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrene and načapalo culprits."
The process is to "painful, but positive."
We are at the stage of cleaning wounds, but it needs to be set up in Montreal own investigative unit and ensure supervision to these dubious practices could not go back.
Like cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned, in particular the role of "Members informed about the device," if these gaming hooves!
It is estimated that 70% of campaign financing in Quebec comes from the dirty money, and he adds: "I heard that it is just a brew of fact."
The Quebec government proposes to restrict gifts parties at 100 dollars, but that it will solve the situation: "Until the severely restrict the election spending, dirty money from politics disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control system of awarding public contracts and funding of parties: "Which fall; if you look-boldly to the nature of things, we can build on more solid foundations and with greater control of and compliance with laws."
If this story defamed the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all those who deride him to look at their own backyard.
"PSG is FC Barcelona!"
In this season of you with PSG put a new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went to him, or an entirely new dimension PSG.
They came to us big players.
Every day, I get near them further.
Technical team also helped a lot.
Every day this enables me to raise the level of the game.
And at matches is easier.
In football is all very quickly.
But I have my head.
Since my beginnings in prep school in the INF Clairefontaine until after the transfer in Saint-Étienne, I was always shifting of individual instance.
Taking advantage of a competitive environment, which were introduced by Carlo Ancelotti....
Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is crucial.
And that implies that a player like me, then more flavor to match, and he wants to maximum power.
And anyway, Carlo Ancelotti gives a lot in connection with my status.
The hand has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I am.
Ancelotti and has the final word in the nick of time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all of the technicians.
Today, not in the 1st league an equal and are among the best European coaches.
Has vast experience and the top teams got a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
According to me wins in the Paris more titles.
In January, I had a conversation with him.
I had had a series of injuries.
The trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.
How do you see the first part of the season PSG?
In the 1st league us Lyon picked up the position.
We remain but in tow.
One of our main objectives: Champions League is very easily, we moved into quarters.
What is your club in this competition target?
We will go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we definitely want to be for the quality of European teams heavy rival.
We want to win first their qualifying group from Porto to play in the eighth round at home.
PSG may be in the short term, the large European club?
Budget on it...
To Paris became a great European club, must win titles and to make history.
Today, it is not yet.
On the financial side has PSG means that this could have.
And it would be a failure in nezvítězit 1st league as in last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This really want to win the league title.
In our last season, was missing.
In May we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We picked 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you clear the....
But another club, Montpellier, had the season even more.
I think that this year it will.
Although the title by and large teams, such as Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux, I think we have available weapons to defeat them.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual for us to expect from a given what is invested here and what we have players.
It completely.
It is a fact that, when at home to defeat the Troyes 4: 0 and still find something that we in the angry, so it is not pleasant.
One wonders what you people they want more.
It is not, of course, to win 4: 0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team
In the Champions League, we were able to play.
Look at Manchester City, which is already the second season qualified for the eighth round, and they have invested large amounts of!
Given the invested sums you would expect that you will have before the other 15 points ahead!
The insult the other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in the last season too, with new PSG moved on to the next phase.
It shows how is 1 League amazing.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems as if the PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that says that there is a "dependence on Zlatanovi."
This means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful, and that gives a lot of goals.
Because of that came here and proves that it is the star of the 1st league.
Everywhere, he demonstrated that he is a great player, the star.
In our team we respect man and the players.
And he respects the people around him.
What he is really special.
This led the others to increase their level of the game.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best defenders in the world, it allows the other side by side growth.
How have you been Euro 2012 with the French teams?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury I could play, as I had imagined.
But I lived it, and I came out of the stronger.
Today I was doing in the representation of the play good matches.
And in that I had hoped for from his team.
We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe yourself to our presence was exemplary.
How do you see the first months Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
In the qualifications on MS, we are in a good place.
Coach are strictly is players nearby and can get for the victory.
That was even Laurent Blanc.
I do not want is to compare.
Blanc has reached his goal that we have qualified for Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead our team into Brazil.
It is a draw (1: 1) from 16 October in Spain solid starting the game?
This game we added confidence.
We have all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain was a game in his career.
Thanks to Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks
All the negative effects of the current financial transactions based on central banks, identified the transactions and the costs of processing among the beneficiaries.
How is in the framework of these technologies often true, there are obvious political outlook: The belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), as a virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro...) and the hypertext transfer protocol, similar to the BitTorrent protocol that allows exchange files between couples partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered cca 200 000 transactions.
About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
Course bitcoinu first reached highs of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, about five months later dropped to $2, today it is on the border of about $10 (summary of courses is listed on the page bitcoincharts.com).
Compared with the world in exchange for real money or financial products that nothing is impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) of this fact interested in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin describes as "the most successful virtual money", "competing the dollar and the euro" and "similar to the standard money."
Bitcoin, from other types of virtual money that is as "credits" used for the procedure in the video game, a game or which could buy (and sometimes even back to replace).
Social network Facebook also developed a similar system.
Each month, but the central authority of the controls and treats individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu are all nodes of the network to the depositary of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How this network work?
Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses using e-mailu.
The user can choose another address for each payment, which provides anonymity.
File information associated with this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.
Network so can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
Key phase consists in the writing of this new transactions in this book.
Selected by means of resolving mathematical task specified computers, whose grant, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is the phase cut file; i.e. the transformation of a file on shorter and unique digital print.
The "take" this new transaction and add to her number, then a whole "chopped".
The aim is to find the number, which provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number, the other nodes easily checked his accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructible displays connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have to change.
If the user wanted for fraudulent pay twice the same money very fast (within 10 minutes), the only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
The computer that challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.
In order to prevent inflation, dividing the two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited the number of 21 million, can, however, is split up in part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of the task is also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The Web site, which provides services for Bitcoin, were attacked and the alienation of stored bitcoinů.
"Used to crack the Protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who founded the Paymium, the company for real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But the problem is also true for cash.
Major players, such as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like platform WordPress blogs, are receiving it.
ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizmannova Institute in Israel recently analyzed book current accounts and demonstrated that almost 80% bitcoinů orbiting.
In November, "a huge discount."
"It was replaced thirty thousand dollars," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the transformation of Coinabul bitcoinů on gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of pedagogical books on these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia is equivalent to the credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on a cell phone, but uses a system for verifying the Bitcoin transactions that are due to cheaper.
Moreover, the Nobel manages his identity and may remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set in the traders, where it is not required to install the new terminals or software.
Suffice to say the address, which can be phone "ofotografovat and identify", specifying Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to the questioning of hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems.
"Before the Bitcoin, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," predicts.
The ECB in its report furthermore foresees a rethinking of the different risks, which are now considered to be increased, if this kind of money will be successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what else?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army took control of its territory and to the Afghans choose their own future and wait for everything from us.
The greatest injury suffered in the Afghan countryside, which we punished, because we thought of them as terrorists.
And we also, we lost 88 killed by soldiers, and what all those injuries and mutilation.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, former leaders, who fled to Pakistan, but often the peasants who refuse to the presence of foreign troops as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend its ancient and archaic tradition, although joined the jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance of local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw their support for the fall.
Withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab I watched from the tops of the mountains posázených mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without the attack as an escort helicopters.
Since the end of 2014 in Kabul not talibánci so active.
From their unstoppable process between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty, and the country was in the blood and fire in the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghans have paid the price for these obscurantism that entirely under the control of the Al-klicks' Ido, their situation, however, to our own time.
Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and contemporary talibánci agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became the junkmen, grabbed the state land, which sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and using the huge American contracts for subcontractors.
To discredit; most of them had never been in a fight.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will form the thieves.
Many young wants to leave as leave those who were able to use the American generosity: Capital flight is considerable.
Young had grown weary of war and related ideology.
In exile in Iran or in Pakistan knew the modern world and its benefits is taken.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul are currently 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities are public schools, there were girls and boys.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones; TV and Turkish series, which show the modern world, watching everywhere.
The army is no longer present.
Will the authorities, which will stand up to her forehead, regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army has renewed provincial militia, which are beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should have had to look forward to a certain extent of devolution along the lines of the Western states, but the US to turn to a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so the abolition of the post of prime minister, which existed from the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai wants to foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, is from the 1950s and earlier years heavily reliant on foreign aid.
No industry is unable to recover, no Reservoir does not work, it is not repaired any major irrigation system.
Everything is imported; nothing, only the fruit and vegetables.
Priority has a private initiative.
In the country destroyed three decades of war would be necessary government control infrastructure.
Rumors flew of that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And it only přiživilo feeling that Western states have been only to him.
Without power for the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, and with no means of transport of raw materials through the mountains, but no mining and quarrying can take place.
The Chinese already almost left a copper mine Mes Aynak and left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area, to retain the role of a major employer in the province.
One day it will also be necessary to Afghanistan and Pakistan, it depends on a large proportion of imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat units was completed 20 November.
A new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of current types of aid: Girls and boys, the Department of French lycée in universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
From 2009 worked initiative "to gain the heart and soul of" attempting to reconcile the difficult task of aid and military activities, within which then was service "občansko-army steps" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but thanks to the small French NGO a number of successes in areas of common interest and steps for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which is part of the local workers, helped put down the uprising: Irrigation, well, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, protection of the soil and the expansion of cultivable area.
What memory we leave after two billion euros military expenditure?
Much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2 000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for minor agricultural aid from the local community in Kapisa province.
These farmers to be liberated from the uprising led by foreign groups want to achieve a civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touching them directly.
Difficult to work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohammed Mursí turned to another poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided because of promulgating the constitution, which temporarily grants unrestricted powers, he decided to play a hunch.
Announced on Wednesday without regard to all the others, that the Constituent Assembly next have approved the final version.
Less than a week ago by the head of state to this Assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years used Egypt provisional text, which was supplemented, which weakens the stability of the country and leads to a legal argument.
This new initiative only further strengthen the division of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition president stays in his "autocratic delirium," to "violates their word" and "tramples on the right."
His followers, however, affirm that the remedy as as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crises and accelerate the transitional process.
For two weeks there should be a referendum.
It is a very short period of time, which forced the Brotherhood to withdraw from the text of Egyptians to clarify the article after article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore national and democratic legitimacy, while all the countries have rocked the protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the weekly Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because the hastily organised the vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or keep unlimited powers", which otherwise would have to approve a new constitution to end.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of a constitutional assembly with a large majority of the Islamists text approved.
Most of the Liberals in the vote.
In the middle of November, not long before the publication of the Constitution, bouchli door with the fact that do not have the opportunity to make their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society, or religious minorities their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 people from among the replacements.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise then that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators are further suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes with the day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some members of the Committee argued that the clock in the conference room are not properly adjusted.
The text voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
The object universal attention, Article 2, remains at the same version of the 1971 constitution and states that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, which is the introduction of Islamic law is one of the primary requirements, hoping to replace the term "principles" date "rules", which would allow more stringent implementation.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been repaired, is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", they argue, the liberals who see it as a problem.
According to them, the Islamification of the Constitution is through other articles.
Focusing in particular to Article 220, which confers on the University of al-Azhar advisory role, in particular for conformity control laws with Sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disconcerting because "people called the comments are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see this as the theocracy. "
Liberals worry even more feeds the fact that the next president, universities should be more moderate than the current one.
"So far, no specific religious effect.
With this Constitution, Egypt rámcově civil state.
Most lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but the university workers, many of them majored in French schools, "controlled concerns Alexis Blouet, who shall prepare the work of a constitutional transition in Egypt.
Agrees, however, that "there may be of the interpretation of Article 220, because it used terms belong to religious vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, NB (cf.]
And in the future, the question of the extent to which the civilian judge competent to be able to express ".
Yesterday the approved text is in addition to religious sites very criticised because of the extended powers, which is granted by the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brotherhood insists that their significant restrictions in the former regime.
Another of the place: The powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army will not be the defense budget to parliament, but the National Council of defense.
Furthermore, not in military courts are disabled proceedings with civilians, as called for in a human.
These associations speaks in connection with the text, which is under them directed against freedom of its misgivings.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and an insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially for the press.
No, not the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.
It is the only positive point the prohibition on torture as referred to in Article 36.
This word was not in the previous constitution mentioned.
While the Egyptian president was last night to speak in a televised speech, are scheduled for this afternoon rally.
Supporters of the heads of state will manifest on Saturday.

"A great and powerful" shall notify the Moscow: Emigrants would save money on language
While members of parliament and human rights defenders are still debating the statutory language tests in the country have already discovered fraudsters who sell "fake" Certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities comes every year 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their only purpose is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December entered into force on the law, according to which each migrant workers will be obliged to pass the test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
FMS, however, promises that the appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
The tests, however, will be composed not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and from the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also be certified for obtaining and extension of a work permit.
The exemption is valid only for the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
Subject to this law, which has successfully managed to achieve the attestation and gain academic diploma to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, condemnation and the protection of rights
The test will be working under the auspices of the Puškinova Institute of the Russian language, the University of friendship between peoples, at Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass the examinations in all cities; today it is in Russia opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing support and members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into effect, human rights defenders many times in the press to ask the question: What it actually bring?
What changes to know the language for the Russians, and for the visitors?
First of all, the representatives of migration service - will enable it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the "slave labor."
Many people are talking, today, about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only by recruiting system will enable from 90% to resolve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise in the emigrants, occupation, no education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - says confidently Sebelev - is the future of migrant sentenced to clashes with unfair people who, under the pretext of assistance shall ensure the reference "to the" terrible, cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others, such as he, languish for months without food and documents and to toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receive many complaints.
"In their country, they promise one thing, but after his arrival is my, seize them passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms the Key Tajik government pracovní migrace MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't scold!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, intending to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to go, but they do not have the experience or even with the work.
Of course, it is not their fault, as more misery: Very few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families need something also feed the children, not to mention the fact that it is to be decently dressed, and to get to school.
As children grow to adulthood, must be at the first opportunity to go to work.
Without the knowledge of the language is hard - acknowledge.
"Are you feeling of humiliation and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the language tests indicate human rights defenders in one important thing.
Testing shall be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If you have not and will not pass the test, nor will any other official work.
In the meantime, there are most migrant workers as well as ever in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unauthorized entry prohibited"
Many of the coming of the claims that have official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
The legalization of besides cost money: From 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we have in fact, false documents, registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - he shared with reporters about his experience citizen Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, be stingy, buy the painting"
On the first day of the Act on the tongue, it was found that the false are not only documents of migrants for registration.
Employees of the FMS has confiscated some false certificate language tests.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners have received free: Each of migrants in the hope that they will facilitate the problem with tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.
It is two and a half times more than passing official test: This will become migrant workers three thousand roubles.
The main task of the immediate future as it is to secure system before the corruption that workers could not simply buy documents, in that the government officials and defenders of human.
Government authorities have so far can promise foreign workers who wield the first tests, the necessary time to have completed the foundations of Russian language.
For visitors who cannot Russian, is expected to work in areas in which the required active negotiations with people.
The MVD (Ministry of the Interior) takes in the circulation of the illegal market with weapons
The share of crime using legally held weapons is very low
The MVD Russia proposing a tightening of the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is the reaction of the governmental authorities on the recent events: Stimulus were shooting at weddings, which dispensed with the victims, and the massacre ready Moscow lawyer Dimitrij Vinogradovem, as a result of which killed seven people.
Police wants to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increasing age, from which you can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is head of the Duma for security and the fight against corruption Irina Jarovaja, which promised to change the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to cope with the problem by way of "tightening the screws."
The network was an open letter, whose authors - representatives of the various social organisations rifle, are demanding the rejection of "absurd tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and the criminalist said in an interview with the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior was for six months of the year 2012 committed 142 crimes from the use of firearms registered authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while over the same period it was committed a total of 1168 thousand offences.
Authors of an open letter are convinced the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons to the perpetrators to go to "black" market.
According to their words can currently found in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior, argues that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From plants after officers
"Black" weapons market is supplied by a few channels.
Main channels is five, says the retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who was 10 years in the workplace of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages, which is responsible for ordering weapons
The first of them - "Army or military way", that means the weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons stole and Russian officers and kavkazané themselves," says Baraněc.
Another type of black "arms" are the weapons stolen criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that involves the theft of the police department and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the authorities responsible for criminal proceedings.
Illegal "primarily" comes into the sale of military stores.
In many military warehouses are often the cause of explosions.
"There is evidence that some of the fires have been set deliberately - so as to cover any shortage," says a former soldier.
His contribution to bring words Barance and producers of weapons.
"Currently there are private armaments companies, which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons, which supplied on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and machines comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes here guns manufactured in malovýrobě, and the Mafia, which organized their smooth production," says a former soldier.
Where is the weapon?
Experts made, what is the approximate market share of different sources of supply "of illegal weapons on the black market."
The report on this issue in 2011 has wrought on the analysis of the problems and the design of the public administration.
Specialists examine statements of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals focused on the theme of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, comes from the military and the executive.
Half of all weapons on the black market "because of the officials, whose work is associated with weapons," says the report.
According to the data, which are available to scholars, is 17% of the weapons of the armed conflicts in 14% of the theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology."
The salesman-consultant of one of the weapons, who asked that we do not his name, is convinced that the weapons found in excavations black "archaeologists" had long since nobody is buying - are just too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new consignment directly into the military stores.
Despite the Ensign to Lead buys unit, for example, the TT.
For him, the order and he sells it over the fence.
"That would deliver it to the city, where it sells for €900 apiece, two magazines," she says.
"The truth is that the police is well on track, and therefore whenever they burn plan in the detection rate for offences, the purchase of traders with illegal weapons," adds adviser.
"As in the luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often mutually located over its unknown.
I visited websites and blogs, until the guy who offered me a chance to go on the platform "Test", where it will be the man who would take me to "corner", where together we will act.
Price, I learned to there
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
If I want-to get a weapon, I need someone who knows the way out, tells a salesman - poradce.- like that I have known, but I do not trust him.
Vendors in the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that the little girl lost a tooth."
And now I get there through the man, I am sure.
He is also the only to me, because he knows that I neudám.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Victor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid 1990s, when the paper to the publication of this topic.

They gave him the album with photographs, where it was "all, what you think."
"I felt like in a shop," recalls a soldier.
Elsewhere, in the words of the Baraněce, do not offer a pig in a poke - everything you can try.
I, the potential client, just I ain't buyin - we go with the seller to the woods and build a target.
"Give me a chance to shoot, and when I became convinced that the gun that shoots well, we are starting to act," describes the procedure of the expert.

When buying illegal firearms pay according to experts estimate that the amount of the usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova of NGOs "Right to" get a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300.

The particular from warehouses to permanent storage through stores of Article.
According to the official statistical office, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of these offences in Russia, a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
In the US, workers are on strike fastfoodů and supermarkets
Work on the counter facilities "McDonald" pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last few days, in America, a wave of protests against the low wages in the company of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell", "Wendy 's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of nine, or whether she is destined to be soon disappear.
The share is supported by trade unions and many leftist social organisations.
Apart from the increase in the modest salaries, the receiving line workers in of Walmart and in the systems of fast food, is the organisers of the protest to achieve in them to create in their trade unions.
Currently it is this economic sector virtually untouched union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the "Black Friday" when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, a million inhabitants, and in some cases was accompanied by and brawls.
In this day of some workers, Walmart, in which around the world working to 2.2 million people, leaving their workplaces and demonstrated together with the unions and leftist activists multinationals supermarket chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sold throughout the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries and vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are in an average of 8% and 27% cheaper than in the big supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in shops Walmart buys only in work.
Availability and the range of goods made chain Walmart is one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of the critics can afford to Walmart to sell goods so cheaply partly because few paid their employees.
They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic trucks or small scanners.
The demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies rose sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Typical worker Walmart receives 9,5 dollars an hour, but that does not match the height of expenditure, say the staff.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase the average wage of $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion per year.
It is in an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If the company Walmart moves to increase wages fully on the shoulders of consumers, will each visit to the state only 46 cents more.
For the year, so customers will spend about $12,39 more than today.
Advocates of Walmart pointed out that protest took place in nine countries and companies should not cause almost no damage.
"Black Friday" in the stores of lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursdays until midnight the following day, and during that time, the company Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods in the second.
Overall, the Treasury in "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview for retirees aimed website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was a "other media sensation", organised by the unions.
"Neobsazená treasury!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was not commercial houses Walmart (those in the progressive city are not too fond of, and therefore almost here are not), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says that sells billion portions, and then you be paid sick leave and is not properly you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York $7.25 an hour.
Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average they receive their ordinary workers in New York 8,90 dollars an hour.
In this expensive town has no lower wages.
Well, how can you in New York exist for that kind of money.
Employment in "McDonald" can get away with almost a quarter of American teenagers who are working behind the counter after school part time and live with their parents.
Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for long.
Currently, I kept in an interview with workers "McDonald," who complain that live on the money, and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum on the Wall Street Journal hangs comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you know how it is you feed.
The protesters, which began at 6: 30 a.m. Thursday in "McDonald on the" were Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks in fast food began to receive at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wages.
Also demanded that in the realm of fast food were based trade unions.
American laws prohibit the administration to prevent the creation of trade unions and activists to punish the trade union movement victimisation and redundancies.
From the other side of the management of them rarely makes life easier.
Deploy in fast food trade unions, however, is difficult even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons it is extremely high turnover of staff.
Disagreement
On this day, held a noisy protests also in many other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of that action was in the noon rally in "McDonald" near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald" says that sells billion portions, and then you be paid sick leave and is not properly you for your honest work! "
The demonstrators to support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to act together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair remuneration for their work and economic prosperity it deserves every New Yorker!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American sphere of fast food.
But it was only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether the event will be the spark that lit the flame of mass movement, is still unclear.
"So far, doing brain to deceive the average"
Among fans of modern technology virtual reality is a popular topic augmented reality; in the last time, it means in particular view the world through the prism of special glasses.
In the early years, at its annual conference, Google has shown a working model of the news, and in November, it was announced that the application of the relevant patent has also submitted a Microsoft.
In an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim suggest that, for scientists are spectacles of the past.
Láká je prospect tampering with virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- tell us, in general terms, what deals with your research group?
- We are dealing with the interactions of a man with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Mankind has stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes on the screen.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipating significant changes in this interaction.
For example, console Xbox and Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without sensor Kinect, because for all of it is very interesting to the proceedings with gestures.
- What is still ahead of us in the future?
- Despite that, the Kinect shifted interaction on physical level, very much interaction is still on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The flow of information with improved (system accepts greater amounts of data), but output flow yet not especially.
We are trying to change it, we are working on a 3D imaging systems based on different technologies including projektivních.
It is necessary to allow the computer world into our physical world, to make him real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to identify not only users, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in much better shape.
And in the first place, to hell with the stupid helmets virtual reality!
What do you think of vocal control?
It is a popular thing, but not be remeasured?
- Sure, it cannot be considered as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform the other in our vicinity of its activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with the computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, devices control in public places we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not for long, just about such Granny, short.
Gestures, while nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet, which followed the movements of the bone and muscle.
Yet it is great, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, that the future of the Joint Control Type, for example, gesture + voice.
- And it how?
- How me, for example, asked me to give you this can of soda?
You tell it, and at the same time.
I usually just talking.
Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.
So you want to get users to adapt to what in the moment can or cannot machine?
- This is not necessary, but it is an approximation.
I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can detect more reaction.
It can, for example, be laser scanners, which provide a relatively good depth of distinction, this is very important.
- if you have-to talk about their work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requirements of modern cameras?
Today is not sufficient detail, depth or something else?
- In fact, the current generations - this is what we can be reflected in our work in three dimensions.
Of course, that it would be good to 8 megapixels at 1000 f / SC
But it is not just the megapixels, but as a matrix and depth.
Looking at the matter are all current technology for lack of us - it seems the work of designers algorithms.
So we must remember not only distinction in axes X and Y, but also From.
So very important is speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is a dynamic and the current data flows 30 frames per second, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass produced scanners are closer to the other value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of humans with the machine.
For me in the work was very useful equivalent of such equipment, only need so much touching, but I need some frames per second.
- A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In the Kinect system are now used three "camera", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - that is, in fact, a scanner visible zone.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
The greater number of cameras could potentially to solve the problem.
Or worse, because it would increase the volume of the necessary performed calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature of cameras and see how this will help in determining 3D position.
- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presenting publicly their glasses.
Do you not think that as regards the daily use of technology augmented reality through special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
-of course, walk and constantly keep smatphone in his raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest variant would be "portable" form of reality, where it would be possible, on the basis of the platform arrivals / departures areas whenever switch from his glasses on the smartphone, the display screen, and around and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal equipment, this is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also weakness - on the basis of augmented reality glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common man.
There is one problem, which critics often point: There is a response.
Hands feels nothing!
What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?
- In their classes often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh successive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think that complement the tactile could well be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, is one of the more interesting tricks - the use of his hand as a kind of background for viewing.
An excellent way records compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on the addition of these appearance of solidity "images in the air" - such as the interference of the direction of the ultrasound beam in the defined point where finger, raises the tactile sense, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on the pads of his fingers.
There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects nerve endings in his fingers - also promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that feel what it seems that he should feel at the moment, when you see?
- This is a good idea, that we have tried.
Here is another challenge, which will fight long - how to make the humans, who are physically located in a very restricted area, to believe that he was walking in the open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (no such as in clubs), a moving platform and also huge balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes goal, so the work is still in many years.
This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things is in the very early.
Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradska avantgarda", dedicated to citizens, who are in the lead, they are avantgardou culture and the arts.
At the top of the list have been notable art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often found recognition in Europe without reaching všeruského eminence.
The new hero "Rosbaltu" is amazing designer Ernest Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - the bearded man, who is dressed all in red, which you see here in the Russian Museum, in the Summer garden, here in the taverns and vernisážích.
Images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators.
Ernest Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, the creators of the new mythologies.
Ernest Miller - this is a striking man St. Petersburg Touch of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Besides, that is a city man, his appearance on the streets is the smile on the face of the citizens, is increasing all the mood.
Recently picked up the organ and became a Saint Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with my uphold the bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Clive, why do you around town in a red and yellow or, for example, in a turquoise?
- 'I have chosen red as a designer in due and image.
In this world is a red colour compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
While it is generally accepted that everything is a little different from the grey, aggression and brings bad properties.
But my provocations are geared to was bound conversation.
The whole history of my provocative acts is above all an invitation to the discussion.
- A when you understand that you have to be an artist?
- The Exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky, where they were exposed to my work.
I understood what is my path.
Then she went to a wave of old free unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists I could not understand.
I made friends with artists new wave, with post-gazoněvskými who brought us to "Puškinské 10", and other wool were not.
It attracts me to the theatre, clothing, music, in all genres beyond words.
- And it all had mutated in your art-clinic... - For me it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where should gather all the forces of creativity.
In 1995, I took place on 10 Puškinské, and there before the renovation was musically-art club, arty club, home petěrburkské Bohemians.
There was much: Nome, Tequila Jazz, remember how Šnura brought with the project "Ear Van Gogh."
Šnur and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, dressed in full-length leotards, midway between them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.
When the band began to play live, "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programmes hali-galivských times.
We gave them the Trachtěnberga, started his career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137," club "Griboedov - this is the aftermath of Art Clinic.
This way they left our workers and permanent guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000 he was structured survey in the press, the special price was "People in our city."
In the nomination "Artist," I was appointed as I, that ended in my top.
In the new times under the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity of today are different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- your works are characterised by an identifiable way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which it is vividly captured timeliness and penetration.
I have a programmatic exhibition "of the Russian Museum in klaunech."
Clowns are timeless categories.
Before, I used to be sociable, today it is painful and terrible.
But in klaunech everything collapses, scanning the tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguise in having order.
Today people meet under clothes, focusing on external drive, not a single man.
Or perhaps he could not take his hand and it is necessary to spit in his face.
And illusion will be removed to change.
- Recently we have seen you in the role of urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be, if not me?
- A may be commercial art fair?
- At present should be commercial, utility art thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is the failure of the cultures.
In the past, people used in clumps, bohéma loved one, the other people.
Today, all broke on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very hard to all.
I am not a 100 bill, I liked all.
It is necessary to think who likes.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of its 100 fans.
- A on Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators!
- The him come fans, there is sexually social sphere.
And on the cultural land come 300 people and 10 thousand of them, and the result is less management, money, everything shrivel.
I have fans, is that no one is fooled and, what is ingrained.
When I was young, I was painting such images that one collector hung on the wall, along with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images, which people generally ends.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Culture, the culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of consumer, it is from somewhere else.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused to money for drawing images.
And I for this culture.
- Clive, what is in Petersburg?
- Dobrých experts on culture.
There is such a concept: Functionary through culture.
Not all of them, but he can deal with the culture.
For the proper tsars that it was not at all, tsars may not understand culture, but understand that it is necessary to support the real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
In Saint Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are kept out somewhere in a corner, because they are the need for large experts who properly appreciate these experts and is on the right path.
Now Ireland is so prosperous vkusovština.
The same Erarta, but differ by honestly say that not all modern art, we are artists who should look for other museums.
What is it you think Petěrburk?
- Petěrburk - this is not the main city of culture, in Moscow is culture much more, there is the right land.
And on our fallow, the art of doing poorly.
We need a cultural land, but it is our writers today more than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe is very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
For us, it is a layer of only weak.
We need to art has become a fad, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is carried out by means of a grant St.Petěrburku
A baby in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or the collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of ships with Earthlings on board shall be issued on the road, looking for alternative planet.
To save humanity, this raises the question: How to keep his rod in terms of fall or to the spare planet?
I think that the selection is not great.
In fact, there are only two of the planet, which it is possible to learn, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says a senior scientist for the National Astronomical Institute p.. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While they are but on Mars better conditions for life, on the surface of Venus are reaching temperatures of up to 500 degrees Celsius.
Live there is possible only in high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To address the issues of reproduction in space, scientists began with flora.
For half a century ago were carried out experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas produced in orbit are no different from our Earthly kin.
It was then made the judgment of insects in orbit - very small the fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979 was sent into space for the quail eggs, to determine how the developing embryo in microgravity.
On output, we are absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find support, to stand on its own feet and begin to move," says the head of the Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they support, the chaotic fall and do somersaults.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds to complete the demise of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that, in four days just died.
"Twice we left turn into birds, but then we rejected, because there is simply impossible to work with them," says the failure of the experiment with the chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarcha" with animals flew into orbit before 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
In biosatelitu Bion "but" will be the only beings of one sex.
The experiment with rats, who were already broadcasts into space.
In fact, there had been nothing supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment, and such experiments is to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground by rats was born offspring.
Approach to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, but failed.
It is a difficult task.
Animals at the loss of the usual environment simply cannot pursue its sex instinct.
Man, unlike the animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens is an abstract thinking, and is able to create an emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments not carried out.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The biggest danger Tereshkova ’ s.
Nejdrahocennější thing mankind has, it is the female body.
Our Chaika flew, and no one on Earth could not say whether the last years in space.
Whether he could for a flight to give birth to a child.
"Why, on this question, no one answered," says veteran ’ s space-sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The father of the child was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, was born the son of the other woman-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice and who worked in the open space.
The risk, however, remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, which after years of birth and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous, even in the orbital years," says an astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Russia Valeri Polyakov.
Humanity still must inevitably seek new roads in the area of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a mandatory stage training to fly.
Here in conditions with zero gravity, astronauts embrace habits needed to work in an open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
Though for adults is water, while comfortable, but in a way a strange environment for small children is a natural element.
Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is situated in an average of 9 months in the amniotic water, and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing expire only 2 weeks.
"This is a very little to the forgotten something," says swimming instructor newborns Marina Aksenovová.
In short, if it is for newborn baby weightlessness more natural condition, then for women is natural, inevitable gravity, magnetic force.
In microgravity is very quickly to the wasting disease of abdominal muscles, the muscles of the basin, the body ’ s ability to expel the fetus.
We can leave aside, if they work promoters of muscle in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the organism mother dismisses the foetus.
"And what then?" Asks Valeri Polyakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs the artificial gravity.
If not for the organism gravity, fails to form a skeleton or a set of muscles.
The newborn baby in orbit, it is not possible to dress like an adult in a suit to the burden, in which he could train.
They will be deprived of what developments urgently needs.
"If you go to the experiment, which shall accept the birth of a child in an alien environment, bring on Earth, a disabled person who would be completely inappropriate to our environment," predicts the Commission for Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So having children in the universe is now just a theoretical question.
Once, however, the time would come when the reality and when Earthlings issue in their ships on a distant planet, which has become the home of their offspring born in space.
The OWLs: Control švarcsystému failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has in connection with public procurement good controllers and the quality of legislation, but fails in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but must be correct application - this is what we believe is missing," comments on the current situation Kala.
Similar conclusions also suggests joint control of the Czech and German controllers.
As an example of an incorrect practice provides access Petr Nečas led to "švarcsystému."
Recently, the Prime Minister, said that the ODS will not entrepreneurs to bother his controls - so it is forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be somehow set, and if something disables, and even the Prime Minister can prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German aside, within which was compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
About what was it?
It is a parallel, which we took off about two years ago.
Put simply, European legislation is governed by the way in which the public procurement contracts to address, followed by the different national legislations and then also the practice.
We are all this together, and even when the control is not yet completed, we have a very interesting differences - generally speaking legislation is perhaps even more stringent and "improved", but the practice is in some parameters better in Germany.
Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to take care of itself, the application of the law.
What you actually this project can help, what of him for you?
Just such a common control might help to stop previous efforts to refining laws, reducing and improving margins, if it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means to obtain appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always), the lowest price in order to avoid any enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But, by reducing the limit of contracts, it does not need to be achieved.
Maybe that saturate the system of "paper" that those who in the system they want to find the hole, so does it will be much easier than if the limit was higher.
You speak of domestic problems with the transfer of the legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does control system in Germany?
There is the office of a similar to our OWL, or it is configured differently?
What the authorities concerned, such as OWLs Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organised like us, also has a division, is a slightly different way, but in essence, both authorities are following.
Also powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the following the courts and at the level of individual Länder - in the system from our little different.
BRH can be controlled only federal money, we posed by state resources.
Public funds, which are with us managed by county, the municipalities, the control of the level of federal auditors.
What the legislation, so that it is easier than ours?
In general, I would that without specific data like comparing, however, in some ways, is Germany cited as a model, but I cannot say that it is, in all the better.
It is therefore necessary to that have better controllers?
Probably not, but again, I have no such comparisons.
But it has to be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, faced with a series of problems.
Otherwise, it was no benefit to cooperate with our authority, no?
As regards the domestic legislation, what of your office meant the amendment to the law on public procurement, there are somehow its impact?
Whereas the validity of this novel is a relatively short, so we still in control events is not a man.
Because we are of ex post controls, is the need to deal with some delay.
We observe that so far only in the process of preparing the future of controls - we started our new tool "risk detection inefficiencies," through which we run almost 14 grand public procurement, and we analyzed it - there are those changes are, of course, because the change limits, the conditions of certain types of selection procedure shall be adjusted, and the like.
The approval of this bill therefore consider more as a benefit, or other load system bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that this is the case.
The problem that there may have been that she "tighten rules" and can not be adhered to.
Under the previous rules are controlled person obliged the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes Regional Council) to each of the law on public procurement means a breach of the budgetary discipline.
So, is the price of the law in this way;?
I think not in this way.
The system shall exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision.
Such a system will produce a greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how it out?
Let us show the way.
Recently, the Prime Minister, said that the ODS entrepreneurs will not bother controls that alleged "švarcsystému" - and what does it mean?
Švarcsystém is forbidden or permitted?
The law must be somehow set, and if something disables, and even the Prime Minister can prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations.
May said: "We change the law and permit it," but I can say that we do, nothing like that.
In the public procurement law are fairly strict rules, as what is to be formalised - which is right to protect the public tender.
But on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer is out of the question for the formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but must be correct application - this is what we believe is missing.
Roads are passable but mostly, frozen
In a few places in the Czech Republic are also snowy and icy roads.

Simon Ornest: Concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about it, is less than a month to be the end of the world?
This is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap that we are doing more fun and we say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the end of the world or delay prevented.
In December, your totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
You can take it to readers to imagine?
It is a national fund raiser, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential end mayského calendars advertised on 21 December at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before 20 December from 21 hours, 3 concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Time will be about the time on the island of Martinique in the Pacific, which is in the time zone for 12 hours before us, the end of the Mayan calendar.
Who with this idea?
It was my idea, then we are all up together with our artist John Augusta.
In addition, that we want to amass a positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want, together with the public think about the state of the world once we bequeath to our children.
At the end of the calendar mayského we also created a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags or original shots against the end of the world whose buying on www.e-tap.cz us people can also support.
Group The Tap Tap, together with the other performers also sang the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World cancelled."
Today is a very popular on YouTube, also on the charity concerts?
Of course, in the very end, if we succeed, and the end of the world will not happen.
They all her performers in all three concerts in parallel.
Anthem suddenly link in a live coverage on Czech television.
The words to the song, and wrote the role of Jesus in shooting hraje Tomáš Hanak, singing in her also Xindl X...
How did you get to cooperate with them?
We are also working with the other members of the Czech cultural scene, given that we have a lot of charity events and concerts...
We are is intensively in these projects involve.
It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and fun.
What can the proceeds of concerts against the end of the world?
For an accessible training centre, which Studeo sixth year, with civil society in the Tap Jedlička's Institute for the Handicapped.
For students Jedličkova constitution regularly are running out of instructors and deal with them in the activities that is fun and interest.
The students do not have the means to the teachers themselves, they are not, therefore, allow this way.
In the framework of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there will be a separate building into which the project through.
At every concert vystoupí několik musical groups and performers.
According to what you pick?
We tried to set up a program that appeals to all age groups, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All for details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you want to plan a similar "purple action" in the future?
In May we first appear on the Prague Spring, so here we have an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I would like it to link with the speeches in Washington and in Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not a minimalist, you were stepping, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of disabled people.
As these paths manage logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it first appears.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, its trucks must travel in the luggage area, also, of course, feel a large quantity of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far, it always performed without problems, CSA and British Airways on us were well prepared, how many times I had to.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, that was no problem.
Thanks to výjezdům abroad, you can compare the different in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.
With what you have not yet met?
After the Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places, where everything works better than us, we just in Russia have seen that in the east is still in full.
Compared to the Prague is Moscow very barrier, there is still an unusual that a man in an electric wheelchair himself stood in the center of the city.
There is no such obvious as a wheelchair users should give priority in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civic associations that seek to problems for people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There is a lot of things, in which we are still behind....
But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation is always depend on the efforts of people involved.
In London and Madrid is perfectly normal, that is, people with severe disabilities separately on the public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere.
But it is not very normal, that there is a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in the social life, in that we have with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only up to the moment of us will be important athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, so things start to change really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let us go back a few years back what you in 1998 to decide to set up her?
I got as tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I have many young people who were interested in something to do.
And as I musician, I play, among other things, on saxophone, so I, together with my colleague founded extracurricular musical circle.
Well, and over time it, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).
Popularity but came up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that help us, when we began to link with singers and also to work actively to promote bands.
Us that work, which is not visible, in fact, as would not exist.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment, and so on.
It was your intention to go with The Tap Tap that high?
From the beginning I felt the potential that we can do something else.
Showbusiness is crowded with where one is another.
It is a logical, all new shall be taken with caution, and it takes a long time.
Things that are isolated, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who can see us for the first time, is, of course, regret, it is natural.
But the pity is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not suffering all the abandoned beings, which we must regret.
These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary resources.
I say that when we get back to people with disabilities, so it is not the only for them, but for the whole of society.
Help this success, that you are a stern boss, how many people you saying?
If we want to do a good job, we must be in many cases uncompromising and require a certain discipline.
But I think it is perfectly normal.
Some people are coming to us with a romantic idea, and with his head in the clouds, and if he finds that has twice a week to go on trial in medicine and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, so is the enthusiasm quickly leaves.
This is how it works everywhere, in each group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We open group, people come and go, this is impossible.
Who has the will and the taste is always the door open
It will be held the day before the expected by the end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava, led recently Plynojemu for the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic

Poland and the cosmos.
Last week it was at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency accepted Poland for the member of the European Space Agency, as the other countries of the former eastern bloc countries (in the Czech Republic, which is a full member of the ESA has become 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects of the Agency.
But the path of Poland into space has already begun much earlier.
Years into space was devoted to the Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War, but not always met with understanding.
I, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which 6 December 1933 was thoughts of his pioneering work Access to space.
Thoughts of a young engineer (b. 1905) had an audience with cold, and after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski said about his work.
Šternfeld in 1934 gained Access to space in France price Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.
Dr. Vzpomenutý Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a big advocate of astronomy and space.
In the Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became the world ’ s famous purveyor of aerospace and his contribution was awarded and the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named on his behalf.
In 1925 was built in Poland, the railway trolley, which should be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and unknown or details of the project.
It is not even clear whether it should be used for driving away the mantrip or to its application.
Information about the handcar are known only from dobového press.
From 1933 to rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.
Research to make Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From surviving materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of the German troops research was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialist press discovered a photoelectric fighter missiles, designed by the engineer Rohoziński and in the following year out of work - Rakieta torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects are intended for military use rocket engines.
Just before the war, all military use of rocket technology gave Temp Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all work coordinating.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two of its activity ended the war.
Another work devoted to space after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is mention of society in the November issue of 1954 magazine Problemy, in which they are four more comprehensive articles on the subject of astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, is designed to create a society, which will take up space.
In that time, he projects in artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is promising field.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautická company (PTA) snažia on entry to the International astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Deputy International astronautical Federation.
This function until his death in 1959.
From 1956 to PTA played a significant role in the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which carried out the research.
The first type of RM-1 has been completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a ceiling of 1800 meters was about 80 cm and a weight of less than 5 kg.
Later she was built an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 started in Bledovské desert flight tests of two instances rockets RM-2.
The rocket was long 1.4 metres and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Another development type had been able to real scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have the ceiling to 14.5 km and its task was monitoring the height of the wind.
However, in 1962 was further developments paused.
Descended first rocket type RM has become a rocket meteor-1 developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two tier, its overall length was 510 cm and a weight was 32,5 kg.
They were developed three types (marked the meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different sizes for the scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A was available space of 0,4 litres, meteor-1B of 0,34 litre and the meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
Service ceiling: With all three types of was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 probíhal v Leteckém Institute development rockets meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket meteor-2 was a mass of 380 kg and was able to bring the payload on the weight of 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Subsequently, built version of 2H and Tut-Tut-3.
It is worth mentioning the entry of Poland to COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a National Committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also in the framework of the Interkosmos involved in research space on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after Vladimir Remek second interkosmonautem.
Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court of law on public works.
The resolution would live in public debate.
Of course it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic services, national economic systems are in permanent conflict between them.
This is the principle of free trade and free movement of an unrestrained private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The influence of the considerable differences labour costs, (wages) there is a price tensions.
This concept is to be understood condition, where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods stand in the competition, "will" price competitor to wear a greater share of the market and thereby to increase their profits.
On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or buy cheap, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where prices are working in comparison with other economies high.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility, and that the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising necessarily social state spending.
The whole situation is compounded by the reluctance of business to pay taxes, and the replacement of the economic and social corporate damage in the pursuit of profit has done.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to be specific statistical data.
Reckless practices of private equity in the individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to enter the competition with a view to artificially reduce social level of their own populations in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to their own population regardless of social decline.
It is, above all, in the amendments to the applicable laws.
The aim is economically forced their own population the diktat of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
This is happening on the system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment, partly by limiting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with an increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are already many years of public ticket food for the poor, who are unable to feed their own work.
The number of these people is already in a million.
In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is common to cases that properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was published, and in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Council.
Austerity measures, virtually all of the southern states of the EU was undoubtedly lead to the same condition, where the people are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social level forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or left to languish on starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might someday private equity capital.
Here is to be but inquire where but coming?
If it from other EU countries, then moves from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or the Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still working for a fraction of the European wages.
It concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media ad nauseam claims that the state can capital to participate in its own economy that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity stubbornly takes the view that the state must not control interventions to intervene in the economy.
Then there is a need to ask whether private capital does not affect, now governed by policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.
There is a clear answer yes.
Proof of the existence of virtually omnipotent and in all Member States of the lobby.
The result is a desperate situation, in the area of corruption, providing the mutual advantages, the law, where it is virtually all reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds are entered the drafting of the laws of the private legal firms, which are often in connection with the industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All the power that comes from the people how to preach to the Constitution of the Western type, but from the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.
It is clear that a liberal oriented democracy is now entering the situation as it describes Appiános in his work “The Crisis of the Roman Republic for the days of Caesar and Pompeia:" State was already long in full of decay and authorities obsazovaly violence.
For bribes, unlawful obtaining favor and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people go to the polls with a sold voice... "character" of the people, so that they shall not apply, so once it was as a result of this disruption has become eight months without consuls "..." It is indeed to talk about the fact that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda, and that it is necessary to choose the energetic man.. "Appiános while he thought of Pompeia, but the Caesar, who changed to take democracy to tyranny.
Conclusion As in antiquity as is the current company based on a reckless preference for own benefit regardless of major interest.
Private equity is not inherently able to understand and apply to major.
The result is now, as then, unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform more profound.
Kauzalitu onset of fascist and communist regimes must therefore find in indiscriminate liberalisation economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, can be the demise of these systems in favour of democracy liberal type as a break with the expectation of further rounds.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites ignores in future be fined casualties, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have now seen together with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
Repeal of the law on public works is not an option, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition both on the international and the European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system.
The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms, which will strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, will strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company in favour of the state.
Israel: Lab chaos.
"Nothing can come from violence and never can" Sting in song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus, "let us not forget how frail"
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschela Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, was a lot of reaction.
One is for Israel, they argue its right of self ‑ defense and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, other support the Palestinians argue racism of the Israeli state, the genocide inflicted on the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I wonder who is in periodically with the periodic waves of killings and who blame the victims, after all, the people of Israel, including community territory were born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence.
The point is to offer readers to peek behind the curtain, the sight of it, to whom, in particular, are already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the countries of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the historical facts, some of them based on the basis of my own understanding of who or group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily history struggle for power.
In every era can be traced some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is if it were always these figures, which are completely autonomously manage their steps, or for the throne was someone who directing their actions to advance vytýčenému goal.
We have to admit that we live in a time when it is the world ’ s wealth be tested should be concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation.
Between these astronomically wealthy families out one, which could be considered as head of octopus (if someone standing over them, I do not know, but I do not rule out that) - Rothschieldové.
Much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s of the 19th century to stop connecting their names with a criminal acts, in whose background stood and which for them has always been to consolidate power, an increase in wealth, or both.
They are the main shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank should not be conducted or prepared war (against Afghanistan that was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq that was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi had only four, but in the meantime, Russia provides that the central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone this family tried to resist, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of central banks Rothschieldově Bank of America, he began during the civil war to issue its own (government) money, was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered in 1963, a member of the Louis Mc Fadden was in 1936, poisoned after what he wanted to sue FED for launching a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars, the Freemason 33 degrees insiders Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove a monarchist state authorities in Europe, the other was to remove the colonial estate in particular of Great Britain and the third has lead to a reduction of the world ’ s population at 0.5, 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury and do not consume so much sources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is none other than the clearway available for such a solution) and a final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group ’ s richest families headed by Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are false and lead to deterioration of the situation (see the FED, to avoid a crisis like the one in 1907).
So then, what they managed to the assassination of the heir to the throne of In-House R Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the first world war, destroyed the czarist Russia running the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (no longer needed to war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and subsequently the fragmentation of Central European powers, Austria Empire.
In order to facilitate the World War II left bankers policy to create conflict may be prevailing situation for Germany imposed huge war reparations, and create a presumption radicalisation impoverished masses, and then they had to do was strong enough to the Germans, the culprits, identifying and simple solutions offer a leader and the creation of a multiethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play, and I played, as the fifth column in the ignition of the fire.
At the end of the nineteenth century the goad Rothschieldové the establishment of the Zionist movement, whose one branch of the creation of the Jewish state, not in the historic of Judea, with Jerusalem as the capital of the (return to Zion).
Already the Balfourova Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration Jews in Palestine, the first clashes with local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, if Hitler from the chain, which he initially international bankers, or what he did in the plan is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp has created a prerequisite for acceptance of the Jewish state of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and as it was war reparations Germany brewing 2.světovou war, was the establishment of the state of Israel created by the outbreak of war third.
If her international bankers can unleash, will be the Jewish nation, as in the other, of victims in the first line of the fighting, now, together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos in the country, but also in the international scale (consider just how sharply divided people to supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who the victim in palestinsko - Israeli conflict, where sin begets wrong in an endless chain of violence, when it was greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because as with us, peddled international bankers people choice in the election only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, international bankers loyal, politics, which is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict, and due to the control of Iran over Hormuzským channel, which travels 20% of all the world ’ s oil (navigation corridor is only two miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In which the light now seems the words, which he said David Rockefeller in 1994: "What we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
New world order in their vision is of a world of lords and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
The world, where every new someone born individuals implanted in the birth of a chip that is totally controlled entity.
"And it makes all small and great, rich and poor, free and slave to have on his right hand, or to the brand to buy or sell, who is not marked on behalf of the beast or number of her name.
It is necessary to understand: Who is whether summed up the digits of the beast.
This number indicates the person and it is number šestset sixty six. "
Film Argo: When it comes to Hollywood
In November 1979 occupied the crowd demonstrating Islamist students the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, patron of his regime for several decades.
The situation for the US administration offered a positive outcome - Shah throw overboard could not afford, because that would threaten the confidence among allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was compounded by the fiasco attempt to free the hostages.
Imprisonment of diplomats were finally released for 444 days, after negotiations mediated through the Algerian government.
Their fate at home of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, in the 1980 presidential election.
Film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history, which America has brought a small victory.
Just before the conquest of her fled six employees.
After the complex business ended up in the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get it from Iran, helped the extravagant cover story - drove to the Canadian passports as members of staff, who in the country surveyed the location for the SCI-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by an expert on "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, require the cooperation of Hollywood.
That a legend was credible, on film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation for a long time were classified, the film is based on memories Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a strange combination of more genres.
On the one hand, realistically, the political thriller, also called "caper movie", the story during a piece, podrazu - example may be a series of Danny teammates.
In the film, so turn the mood - on the one hand dokumentárně broad sequence from Tehran (in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické period photos of events and the way they were the same situation presented in the film - the large differences in that they are not).
On the other hand, lightweight passages from Hollywood, pojednané with irony and slight exaggeration.
Then there was the scene of CIA headquarters and other institutions -muži in suits are discussing the situation at the table, in the corridors of the Office, in the phone.
Ben Affleckovi to restart a remarkable career.
From the mockery actor has become a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of cynical comment.
Argo is his third feature film, after dark Czech Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller Město (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film, which was discovered in the director's is home to Boston.
CIT for the atmosphere of the place was between characteristics, which director older films place above Hollywood standard.
And Affleck him in Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are taking place in the streets, when rekonstruování real events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also will emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that arise when somewhere suddenly move history.
A similar effect of Affleck and his colleagues are in the scenes fabricated (fake staff in Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that told the story does not offer much in the film the meaning of exciting scenes.
Quite successfully with the works, sometimes to the realities of something přimyslí - it was all so elegantly leaves (a scene in which the impending crisis in the Tehran airport averts call in America and chase down the runway is pretty farfetched).
The weakness of Argo is but restlessness arising from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in reels Hollywood collaborators very charming, their characters, but have more space and are not in that movie far from the only.
Affleck film a bit lost a dramatic move, this is a slide that it is possible to monitor with mild interest, to appreciate the implementation and retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
But it hard.
As a reminder of a sort of living history and proof of how exaggerated are ideas about the almighty and vševědoucích secret services, but will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com that announces the poll on the absurd bank levy, has now decided to declare a competition for "absurd regulation or ideas from the workshop of the EU."
"This led us to the last event, when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the management of large European companies," he told Právo organizer ankety Patrick Nacher.
Among the nominees absurditami is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of the unification of premium rates for both men and women.
Still, the women were in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are for insurance undertakings objectively less risky.
"Another incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can people to nominate by the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013, "he informed Nacher.
Between the controversial EU regulation is even mandatory blending of biofuels into fuel, which result in harmful to nature, on the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or the Directive on the size of a hen cages, which this year, significantly more expensive eggs.
Criticism of the previously faced also de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or disposal of the incandescent bulbs for sale.
Quality bananas have have 14 cm
The apparatus, often under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels usually defend any State or group of states (so Česko now a threat to veto promotes the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby, and for that, for example, that bananas the highest quality in the Union must be at least 14 cm in length and they have "anomalous curvature."
The European Commission has said that only harmonises the fragmented national standards, which complicate trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables, the EU over the objections of some states softened with reference to the fact that the existing Directive lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in the survey, it may be the last EU regulations, according to which it must be for sold inflatable balloons obliged to warnings that the children under 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU is the reference to American Research, according to which the balloons between toys are the leading cause of death in children to suffocation.
Similar restrictions are now set for children under 14 years in blowing into a funhouse frkaček.
Bizarre ideas are born and at home
Quite absurd is then rule concerning the European officials — anyone who has in the EU official function, with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece to use the name Macedonia and must place talk to her about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with liberal economists Laissez pinelike put forward to the Polls in addition to some of the absurdities of the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amounts of food stocks, which could be on the territory of the Czech Republic in the day of our entry into the Union.
Česko then crossed for example set by the volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he threatened to high penalty.
The organizers of the survey has adopted the idea to pay some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies on the application for obtaining subsidies.
Those ideas, however, have not been incurred in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We handicapováni that we do not have the sea.
To ask the European Union for reimbursement, "he said in the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument, he said, is with us, so a lot of grain and as a result of the intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported.
For that is the Czech Republic to ports, we should the EU under Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission will eventually came out of the Czech Republic to the fact that organised a tender to purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive subsidies offered to the Ministry for Local Development controlled ministrem Pavlem German (US-DEU), in particular should go on writing applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulation are the exception
A regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and, at the same time, a more effective functioning and development of the entire European Union, according to a number of experts rather deserve recognition.
More serious problem is, according to experts, for example, absorption of EU subsidies to projects that have had something to do with the deepening European integration, but which, in the budget negotiations forced the Member States.
Emotions between Bohemia is that, as well as other countries of the Union must of the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to a specific marking their traditional products, and not always in this struggle will succeed.
The Czechs, after searching the fight with the Germans and Austrians uphold the Olomouc curd cheese, but tuzemsk rum, whose tradition in our dates back to the 19th century, our producers to tuzemák.
Naming rum can bear only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU, in the company of internationally renowned feta cheese and Gorgonzola, marzipan from a German Lübeck or Parma ham already, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr and Žatecký chmel hops.
Mark the EU, then can also Pardubice gingerbread and Petrof pianos.
People want to save the Republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how a man thinks he wants to run for president?
This is not about it, be a senator or a president.
If it in our country worked without problems, so no nekandiduji.
Already, but I cannot see the past twenty years of the country half-blood, as thieves run, people are increasing taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I like it, so I try to come up with a solution to change that.
And since I was forty, and I am an independent man or not, I have no choice but to how things affect, than to run for a senator or a president.
In the Senate, but soon you will get you to the Castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
All the time I was saying that to fight on the go, according to result in the senatorial elections.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.
My aim but is not a function, function is a tool, how can I realize his vision.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not just that as a nation at each other in a pub, and in front of the TV, but trampling everyone who wants to try to change.
Add to this the media, which humans dehonestují and confuse freedom of speech, freedom of the lie.
About me is to be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Go to your visions.
In the battle for the you started with the thesis material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the retroactive property returns over twenty million.
You must change the law.
As president, but you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole may propose legislation.
How do you want to resolve this conflict?
When I was a citizen lobbied for it to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, to reject the citizens.
As an independent man or not I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My priority is that without the partisan categorization and dogmas can I take what is best for our country, of each Party and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more as a human right, or the leftist?
From the English perspective, it seems to me that people are more to the left.
For me it is not important, if a little to the left or right.
For me, it is important for us to move forward.
This is not about whether someone is to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
Always I will support any public good, although he will propose Communists or ODS, and so I am against bad idea.
Čertíte, when someone tells you that you are a populist.
But you that what you said?
If you byznysplán in the company, and you have an ideal target and vision.
And you are trying to close.
Some might call populism, but all of the proposals, of which I speak, in the world of work, or talked about that.
But without the support of Parliament I would have just password.
And with that in politics in the long term nevystačíte.
Or do you think that when you for people to walk and talk with them, that you can get, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Persuading politicians, journalists, and the public, and try to get them on his hand to it through.
If I was elected president, is not a problem to hold televised live, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, the judge and the prosecutor.
And they would eventually have to say why they did not want it.
When will be strong personality, which will be naming abuses, can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was doing public pressure.
Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I am not even a genius, not an intellectual.
For his views and vision of trying to find allies.
In politics, I have only just begun, and for his program to try to get the support of the majority.
Things are trying to push himself, if not, for six years, and I come back to the private sector.
It sounds as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
No savior.
I know that in one person, so I walked around a series of famous people, whether it would also candidates for the Senate.
I went to Radimem Jančurou, that because of the amount of work he refused.
So at least I supported investigative journalist John Lorencovou which rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oil.
I ran with it, that people are really unhappy, but I am now in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote and those who go, most of the elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we only two independent.
People navolili Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my vision, such as for the direct election of mayors and generals.
Are you thinking of setting up their own party?
I even thought, because I have no time to check the net past any potential Party man, and for that I have no money.
I have no money, no to the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20 thousand.
You have no money?
You talk about property returns, what is this yours?
Private property I guess about 60 million.
In Prague I land in about 25 million, the apartment for ten million, another apartment in eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, which means Superb in a million, and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin, I therefore that it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who in the car, he was gallant to women and, at the same time, fought against the corrupt and faults.
Do you Aston Martin, you have the property for 60 million and do not have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but his own money into too much to you.
It is not very convincing.
I have 15 million on the campaign.
It is into debt?
I bumped into the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, testifies about my program is probably not interested.
And I have no obligation to pay from his campaign.
The costs of the campaign in me, will this cover, what will I receive senátorský salary.
But from him I nevyžil, for example, I could pay son English school, which is 30 thousand a month.
I just wanted to make money, so no nekandiduji.
So you will go on doing business, you can live?
I thought you said that these activities utlumíte?
But it is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I partly out of their activities.
For example, the travel agent in the spring of my deputy.
People would like to be Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I need also to make a living.
How much did you like the businessman was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which take on.
And if I were president, so my business.
The whole conversation in the Saturday edition.
Architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure are only in his head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 Sides
"The building is cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, it is once again to see something interesting," said Lisette Verhaig that goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician at the nearby firm, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
I, however, I ask, what today we need library.
They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily nobody goes or, yes?
Spijkenisse, in close proximity to the Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To this silly situation, a few years ago, the decision to contribute to the general education and build seven good painted reinforced thumbnails of fictional bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the training offensives but was not a giddy.
And so the city councillor knew that there was only one way to become masters statistics: We have to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Port of architectural studio MVRDV, master madly courageous column graphs and the contractor humorous, often even cynical buildings, took issue with the usual calm and on the competitive behaviour in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the Commission still stunned looking around and shrugged, piling insolent Maas their gifts on him by size and its aktivisticky reasoned speech ended the words "Dear urban community!"
So this is my proposal to Mountain books in Spijkenisse, called a Boekenberg!
Nine years later, was the mountain for 30 million euros piled.
It is part of the revitalizačního projektu, which also include an underground parking lot, the supermarket, the postal service, and several adjacent residential and terraced home with a total of 50 flats.
In early November was Hora books will be honored the second place "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Maloměstská gray, which still could offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and extraordinarily ugly Hall, whose white facade you expected dairy, it is thanks to the richer for a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, but it has now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of their existence.
The long journey to the book
First impression: The rock and roll under the hatch on the cheese.
Means of Massif mountain jezdí elevator, but the real space and the passion to discover on foot control of topography.
From all sides with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly express the atmosphere in the public square.
Urban environment is perfect.
You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally is the bookcases along the facade, and is in the middle of a dark space, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We are a classic spatial configuration built upside down and space for the reader we push from the inside out.
The interior of the books is cleverly used: In the center of the offices, the library, the chess club, environmental center and switchboard house techniques.
Special satisfaction are black shelves of books that were once the lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the stairs.
Appearance, structure and the smell of the eyes.
Over an unknown building materials, shaking their heads and even devout architects and engineers.
"We wanted to work there with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager for the municipality Spijkenisse, on the question of Standard.
And so we are in one fríském holding one day they found a waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a basis under the roots of a millimeter webs of synthetic material.
It is cheap and effective.
Thin textiles, one of the last two seasons, and then it is ready to blow up into the voluminous waste.
For the library was fleece - for the first time in such quantities - pressed down on plates of a thickness of four inches.
The heat and pressure, the Commission on Human Rights (Landbouwplastic) colour in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit as a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps do you get to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journey you in literary café rewarded not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquettes and ficus trees in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mainly about the humidity of the air in the literature.
Gifts for the new soul
"I suppose you believed it, but this house is despite many glass of a project, as regards the environment," says Trouborst.
Vytápí and cooling the heat.
Although Hora books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.
Broad glued wooden trusses, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as the shading and a large part of the solar radiation.
The climate in the room is a very pleasant.
Can handle the rest fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, starting a skeptic of the IT industry, already a new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Also, a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg describes as a "long awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Each of the people of the city was a few weeks ago, was not invited to the opening to a book from his personal fund.
Should thus first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped with the library, which currently includes 70 000 pieces.
The concept has proved its worth.
Shelves are filled with.
"There is nothing worse than a library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation now has a new home every inhabitant of a relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for show.
The MVRDV worked in the royal discipline, which is in the professional jargon says shaping identity.
Spijkenisse read the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
It is finally starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in deciding on the admission of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa Berlin balanced on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany early in the week, first signaled that they would vote against the proposal on Palestinians observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think that will not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - without, however, would be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also delayed vote when it comes to establishing a nofly zone.
That eventually kicked in NATO.
For Germany is difficult to take in the major international issues a clear position?
Yes, this is so.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of the policy, which was, by the US, in the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is made more difficult by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are therefore between two lanes.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I mean, in his role as only here to stay, but they are on the road to "normal" foreign policy.
In foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain.
What is the "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It shows the readiness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, and its relations with the relevant areas, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent other than the economic interests of other powers, and must therefore Germany to protect their interests.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large outlets in the Middle East, especially in countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, they must be careful consideration to the public, but even the elite in the Arab countries.
It certainly plays a role.
I do but not attributed to too much importance, it is not entirely unilateral relationship.
But in any event, it plays an important role in the German considerations.
Harm relations with the US, Germany, when Germany in the case of both important decisions, such as abstained in the vote on the Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not think that it was so dramatic as a breakthrough in Libya.
Perhaps Germany even recover some respect.
It indicates that must be considered as an international player, and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the initiative.
The US, in contrast, clearly made for the veto.
There are between the US and many European nations differences?
These differences existed in the wake of America ’ s internal policies.
I think the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the European position.
But as a result of the political situation cannot this attitude, of course, from publicly.
I think that the diversity of opinion does not so much, as always.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not too excited Netanyahu ’ s policies.
For Germany is not difficult to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and to position the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think this makes it to the Germans.
For Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
They cannot, therefore, be part of a broader line and they must instead to push things forward from his own position.
That is just doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
For Germany, of course, is not easy, because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a touchy subject.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as a major international player? He wants to take over at the main role?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still used, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
If you look, for instance, at the European crisis, as always, when Germany shall take greater role, arise protiněmecké mood.
That the Germans.
In fact, it is an old problem: We do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics now is constantly falling, but the EU this vacuum currently certificate. Who else is there?
The Germans would just have to play a greater role.
Even if they did not like it, they feel uncomfortable and do it is even more neoblíbenějšími - c 'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, Institute, in which academics and experts on the politics of Europe and North America together study challenges the transatlantic community.

"Protection" brands in China: When are the Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani is a marker, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
For this is the label, which is in China is officially registered, but with the original company has nothing to do.
He enjoys his protection, however, so long as it is real nezažalují brand owners.
And even then, it is not clear whether the law.
"For foreigners is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of the rights in the Far East.
Each week lands on my desk a new case.
Padělatelům just a few letters, so that they can submit their brands.
From brands Gucci, for example, becomes Lu-instead of Gucci and Prada have to register Prada-Kny.
In this way they are legally copied and German companies, sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens folder with the Trademark Office in Beijing.
14 September 2010 had left one Chinese company to protect brand Zegna DF Puma. Artificial name, which parazituje and fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in copying and infringements of intellectual property rights.
In large cities, multistory trading houses, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
Pattlochovy cases are but another. From the credentials of their clients are going against Chinese firms have received from the Trademark Office is officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", and an associated tag.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
This meant women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"That is to the detriment of trade, it must be combated," calls on Pattloch.
"Mark is diluted, monopoly disappears, the damage to the image is huge."
The financial losses and court costs affected industries running into the millions, particularly in precious sample products.
According to the Society for market research is CLSA China with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and market, which is growing fast.
Company questionable entries in the register brands can be difficult to achieve, and something that costs.
Proceedings can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected action, because vytýkaný name became after a long duration of "market reality."
When he has the misfortune to plagiátorovi even pay for the damage to his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Known cases relate to and graphic elements.
In 2009, lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, the company, which recently took over the German producer pumps on the concrete mix Putzmeister.
To this day, therefore, the Chinese may use emblem, which resembles a star Mercedes.
The company Geely to buy Volvo, originally used blue and white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Producer fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers of Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned a crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The Authority Známkový CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of employees and space.
But in the last year, the supposedly "of the labour force returned from the emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed proceedings on the objections have decreased by 22 percent.
Closed, 57 000 of these cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints on request.
To do something about it is expensive
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, it was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is almost a third more than the year 2010.
It is a record, and it means that China for the tenth time behind leads the list of new applications across the world.
This also applies to the number of all existing trade marks — is a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011 it was on fees selected 1.8 billion yuan.
Collectively, this means that each on average cost 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Start against this dispute is multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
This group for more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans have reached that was canceled his illegal manufacture imitovaných car parts.
But the forger clinched the Chinese rights to mark Freudenberg continue.
Alone we had, as in Germany cannot be surname protected, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Authority Známkový CTMO then also Munich firms has rejected.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg obtain rights, but the respondent in dispute is fighting further still.
It is necessary to be awful watch
Now the matter is dealt with in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has the confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us much time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company had to even look at a hundred years old files to submit any evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg the opposite in vain offered high "currently the amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"So you see, what it means to us," says Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East to Europe.
And in this case, when there imitators will ensure unprotected brands.
One Chinese producer, for example in Germany wanted to apply for the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of business group up long ago, yet he managed to avert the registration.
"To be so careful," says Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch advises German businesses that were in trade with China is very careful.
It is not enough to rely on international známková rights. Strangers would rather have had "everything in any way is for protection, even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama of the mark, then he would have to the opposite to pay royalties for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be in the contested segment pushed out of the market.
World Aids Day: Thumping, singing, aid
Heidelberg is testing the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland the joy of the orphans for parents who died of AIDS.
The story, which is much more than 8733 miles.
First of all, there is the: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies and mens shoes for loafers on the dance floor and it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly vzedmou voices singers — alto, bass, tenor and soprano - urging, cajoling and mutually encounter.
Conductor 29letého Fiete Hopfa it almost lifts from his textile shoes, combining the voices of its vláčně wild gestures.
It is Monday night. In music hall at the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg explores the choir Imbongi a new song.
It came to fifty of singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from human genetics researcher for the porter.
"Om 'Obani" is not an easy one song, each chorus voice has a different text and even, in a foreign language - Zulu, which speaks of eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid to svépomoci
UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations for the fight against AIDS, estimates that around the world about 34 million people who are infected with HIV.
From 23.5 million live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found spolek Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attends school of second instance.
For 15 or 20 per month can be patronizing.
Guarantees a child tuition fees, the school uniform and a hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means in the language of the Zulu "a storyteller," or "the one who extols".
In fluent bantuštinou can in this space, no one to talk only to sing.
For almost ten years of practicing choir songs in this strange soft speech and sometimes is also brings back there, where originally come: In South Africa.
In the great circle distance 8 733 miles from Heidelberg is in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland village Esitjeni, which is dependent on the power of the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent of it is infected with
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple clay or straw huts. A large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them parents, for they had succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni is seen in a small, the sick the Swaziland: The highest rate of HIV infikovanosti, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision of the foreskin, which reduces the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland wears virus weakened immunity in each other. It is rare that die in less than thirty years.
This village appeared in the common in Africa in the spring of 2005. But, above all, the members of the Imbongi saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without a school education have in a poor country had no chance.
At first it was more private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros per year to send a child to school and give him a hot meal a day.
But a year later, he founded the society "Voices for Africa", which have since care for orphans of parents who have died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI belong to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Frequent viral SPI are HIV, the human papillomaviruses, herpes glandis or hepatitis.
Crabs and mange belong to the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are especially among men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted by sexual contact between the men.
In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is between heterosexuálními adults in our extended relatively few, but about 20 percent of the newly infected with HIV seems to this group.
Among the young is chlamydiové infections experienced significantly more frequently than other groups of the population.
According to the European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
For us, between adolescents often human papillomaviruses.
How did the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 disease in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV, since 2007.
2011 was approximately 700 cases.
This is about one tenth of less than a year before.
What signs warn about venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, dry, pain in the lower abdominal region and blisters or warts.
Often, however, does not cause any pain or other symptoms, and remain so nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
The risk of infection may reduce condoms, however, do not offer 100% protection.
As the inventors of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted and infections of impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of sidelining sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis is possible to cure the majority of SPI and prevent a later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and last but not least honorářům that make the choir singing throughout Germany, will gather some money.
"We have to send Esitjeni roughly 200 000 euros," říká předsedkyně spolku Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany administered in the village Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman, which can make it.
Also, caring for orphaned children found shelter, for example, in some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of the Zulu says the old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them had even 14 orphans, giving them a roof over his head and looking after the children arrived every day in time in uniform to school.
Children who already have, go to the shelter to Khanyisile, lonely wife, which is a society as well as two cooks that daily cooking for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa," The school sewing, two coops and, together with the American health organisations PSI arranged that many people in the village of let do HIV test.
It is not granted. Even if it is a disease in the country so obvious, all of it.
The king is 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually, very strange in the country, where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for its too little food lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state approved by way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus in recent decades so quickly.
But even many migrant workers, who took over the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are on every corner for free, "but no one is not used.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "
At least a little supported cultural exchange, travels the choir Imbongi every two or three years together after South Africa and singing songs full of militancy, confidence in the future and confidence of black, which many in the southern tip of the dark continent know from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of the blacks - such awards brings not only mood and joy, but also brought a tears for many wild border troops.
The way always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children over which they have patronage.
Although this village could hardly find on maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than familiar.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," said the people there.
And when you get back to Heidelberg, who is from here as the crow flies 8733 miles, to dupajícím singers in the laboratory to Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger found evidence that is on the planet Mercury ice.
Ice cap could have a thickness of up to 20 feet.
The US National Aeronautics and space (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even when it is closest to the Sun, there is also a frozen water, as is clear from the three studies, which on Thursday released a magazine "Science."
The probe Messenger found evidence for it, that in the area of the planet, which lies in the shadow of the marriage, there is ice cap.
This is supposed to be at least 30 inches, and perhaps even to 20 feet thick.
This water seems to come from comets or perhaps from the asteroid belt, which to Mercury.
None but the findings of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury may amount to up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we could help explain how the water and other basic elements of life into other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, nepozorovaní earthlings involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send to Earth imagery, a small window into the infinite horizons.

One of the largest and most incisive frames the Hubble telescope: Whirlpool Galaxy
Slides spiral galaxies, according to his colouring become real works of art.
Slate, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light years distant nebula it swayed in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trojklanný), as the dark streaks of dust are the heart of this star, in three parts.
V souhvězdí Hadonoše astronomers had a precursor of cosmic collision: 400 million light years from Earth, the wife of the kernel of the two galaxies and fluid must inevitably come to a conflict.
This the birth of stars, the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who likes to technical shortcuts, can call her nickname South pinwheel.

Our eyes to the universe: The most important telescopes
Binoculars allegedly invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei him a year later he used to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes still larger -- and looks, which, they are still deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
A mirror on this figure should average five meters.
In the American Arizona is Binocular Large Telescope.
Allows you to look into space by using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is a huge. Only mirror measured in average 10.4 metres.
Mirror Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to uspořily costs.
Yet its diameter is about 11 feet.
The disadvantage of the design: The telescope is ensured in hákovadlem výškovém angle, which is restricted his mobility.
In výškovém angle is fixed and hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
His specialty is high amplification of the luminous flux.
This is in spite of the relatively small diameter mirror mirror dalekohledům up the world.
Using radio in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) are searching for scientists in space for extraterrestrial signals.

Here you can admire him in the picture.
The most important impressions of the universe, but the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope.
The pictures of distant worlds gives us from 24 April 1990.
The space telescope Kepler searches since March 2009 for extrasolar planets — especially for those who are habitable.
2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the start of the mission was established 1235 candidate planets.
In the picture are documented the last preparations before starting the Kepler space telescope.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be the first in 2018 shot into space aboard the rocket Ariane5.
Primary mirror of infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 feet.
One of the tasks of the telescope is looking for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that it is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger circling the planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements showed several decades that is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first, which revolves around Mercury, researchers are now safe.
Daily drink butter and live with 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in the country, where they are 97letí people still relatively young.

Searching for clues in the country, where they are 97letí people still relatively young.
Ride the Talyš we can call it wildly romantic.
The Suburban rumble down the road with many curves along the densely wooded hills, wild rivers and simple peasant cottages.
Everything is green and lush, it seems that we are in the Black Forest.
But this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here live honeybee ethnic group Talyšů, of which this is not much is known, in addition, that is perfectly Persian and ázerbájdžánsky and with a very old age.
Destination is Lerik.
This town is too of monumental architecture from the Soviet days, which is in the picturesque mountain landscape somehow.
Tourists from Europe tourists. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
At 323 miles is required eight hours, because the road is only jednoproudová.
The fabulous wealth for which the country owes diesel in the Caspian Sea, to the countryside here yet.
Pilatus Fatulajeva (48), however, is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May for the price of the Eurovision Song Contest - and here we next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulajeva.
Is the director of the museum in longevity, about one in the world.
This is documented life almost eight dozen Talyšů from around, who are more than a hundred years. Fatulajeva shows black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years.
In the age of 136 years even fathered a child.
A contested a star of the museum, however, is a shepherd sheep Şirali Müslümov, which allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificate, however, there is.
And whereas the oldest man with documents was 122 years, it seems Müslümovův age is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and 1973 died," explains Fatulajeva.
This man was reportedly thrice married and had 23 children. At the age of 136 had fathered a daughter.
He therefore Şirali Müslümov in her age a couple of years?
For years people in Central Asia, however, he heard and Rembrandt Scholz, gerontolog the Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"A lot of people age lives and in some areas of China, Japan or in the valley Hunza in Pakistan," said Scholz, "also in Sardinia are extremely many very old men."
Because of a lack of background, however, cannot be lodged no scientific proof of age, especially when they are missing from the registry office.
Every day a glass of reconstituted butter
But the fact is that the people in the area around Leriku live to the age of the very often.
Currently, there are 20 people, which are more than 100 years old.
Why, then, lives here in the south of so many of the people?
Azerbaijani wizard Farid Mugimzadeh explain specific genes Talyšů.
The director of the museum Fatuljeva, believes that it is in the maintenance debtor.
But that just calorie diet Talyšů who love the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, many of whom daily drink a glass of reconstituted butter, is so healthy, from bromatologického terms it is plausible.
Or is it the way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In 97 years is at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which claims that has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor with máselnicí that relentlessly rolling.
Under one roof, there are eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzajevy. Both are already long grandparents.
Around the jump and two small children.
In the kitchen, for guests preparing tea, which is administered in typical sagging jars "armadu."
White teeth Mirzajevy is perfect, and under the scarf is the long dark blond braids that before us proudly reveals her son.
I always had washed my hair milk, so I did, and keep the color.
"I never used the shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
Monthly pension to life
She ate only what came from her own Court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In all my life I have not once did not buy food at the supermarket.
Then tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst of it was in World War II.
But everything has been enhanced, when an oar took "beloved father Heydar Aliyev."
Propaganda is from the mouth of the old women weird.
But the cult, which makes around the figures of the father of the peoples, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
In power in 2003, then took the oar his son Ilham.
The old people in Azerbaijan at least does not need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension 230 manatů (about the same amount in euro). It is on this world, the amount of which can be well live.
And maybe it has also long grizzled son Mirzajevy: "Old people in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If it is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
In Cairo, the back of the revolution.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo have revealed a deep ambivalence in the country.
Sharp discussion on the future constitution based on Sharia law.
Egyptian President stingy pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And for that we can do that, I was responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended to the entire nation, but above all, Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular parties.
They all still hopelessly, bickering in the opposition, have fear.
The fear of God "state" on the Nile at the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologetically that temporarily restricted remit of the Constitutional Court and extend their to "save the revolution."
But what he wants 61letý engineer, who has the title Dr. American University in Southern California, really save, in that they do not have the Egyptians and the world straight.
Justice is to be deprived of power?
234 sections, which stohlavé Constituent Assembly, dominated by Islamists hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, partly to raise concern.
As in previous constitutions, he says, and in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of the Islamic rights."
But what it means "principles?"
It was and is a matter of interpretation and can be feared that the Islamists this vague wording and the relevant legal free space used for stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least it illuminates the newly added section: In all matters relating to sharia, it is necessary to consult with the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a great influence on the Sunni Islam.
It may not, but may mean that it will be klérus oversight over the legislation, which would justice brought factual withdrawal of duty.
In the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
The problem is also that has to be maintained civil jurisdiction of the military courts.
These courts have served for the Mubarak government to the suppression of the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody to 11 000 civilians.
Standing in the draft, he should be also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values."
It is legally formulated so crudely that would use this section could state institutions even check the contents of the arts and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing else than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing define explicit equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits shaming or to defame the prophet Mohammed and his emissaries.
Unclear, however, is what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
So dubious is the formulation that is prohibited from "insulting people."
Even in this case, the caricature of a president or a joke at the expense of expert rights?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Mursí shall submit to the signing, and according to their words will be "very soon" present Egyptians for the purpose of the popular vote.
"Revolution is back"
For several weeks, the opposition is outnumbered by Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people in an unusual unity gathered Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo, and pledged to destroy the constitutional document before it begins to pay.
"Revolution is back, and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbáhí, who was in the presidential elections in third place.
Nobel laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft constitution is "to the dustbin of history."
Through the short messaging service Twitter followers accused Mursího that they want a "coup against democracy."
"If a referendum, we go to his palace and we will overthrow him," said a member of the opposition Yasir said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brethren is not yet be sanctioned," quoted Egyptian media opposition politician Khalid Military City Ali.
Several justices announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Well organised Muslim Brotherhood declared vzdorodemonstraci, of caution, however, not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before ’ s university.
It involved many veiled women and supporters of Salafis, who called: "People calls for the application of the law of God."
Invited Mursího: "Clear the country!" And ubezpečovali: "The Koran is our constitution."
The battle for supremacy in the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would trigger a civil war.
This Mursího supporters apparently did not want to risk.
Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now it is time to let the people at the ballot box to decide the direction of the country has to go.
For some, it is considered as the majority in favour of the proposal by Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' there is even one"
Forced the constitutional controversy, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa 'du.
Age of forty-eight human rights defenders and the president of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) advocated members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were under Mubarak in prison or stood before a court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because, for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now are the words' human rights' not once," said in an interview on "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursího extending power to all three power components in the country to this lawyer to resign.
These measures are scandalous offense against democratic rules of the game and lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the President of civil society, effectively abolished it," complains Sa 'da.
But without the civil society organisations cannot democracy work.
SA da 'feel lonely and the international community, which monitors the ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This, he might be deadly.
Demonstrant in Tahrir Square warns: "You created a monster, which can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: Most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway has one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
It could be the secret of success countries associated with the local appetite for extremely stinking fish?
Take several overripe cheese.
Put it in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave this week.
So you get the sense of smell paralyzing smell rakfisku, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and the ubiquitous stench hangs in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to one year, it depends on how much you want to fish.
How is dark and begins to be cool, starting with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet at the festival devoted to this, how to say it best nejpodmanivějšímu eat.
"You eat it raw and then drink zapijete aquavitu," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also called a "Rakfisk General", which is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small dice fish and the whole is a large quantity of alcohol.
"Some people have rather than aquavit rakfisk Havard," he says.
The drink may smell of the match.
A few pieces of try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it is not so bad - this is a similar piece of sushi, who was on a bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different era, when she was in Norway poverty, and yet because there were no fridge, fish, in the autumn of wet into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and eaten - senses are no doubt dulled the alcohol.
Only a generation were thousands of Norwegians are forced to leave their land and looking for work, with mostly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% is accounted for by immigrants attracted by a huge amount of work, high earnings and extensive system of care.
Residents of Sweden, the old rival, which was not long ago a much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.
On rakfisk is viewed as something important, an indispensable, although a stinking part of the Norwegian past.
Among the more expensive meals on the market.
Though expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come at 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway in worldwide reports often lack the - and it seems that most of it that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, of racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still cite with distaste.
Instead, it is called the shooting "event of 22 July."
The Norwegians are hard to believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
For the wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world ’ s biggest oil and gas industries in the early 1970 ’ s years of the twentieth century.
"But the oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says in the administration of plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, with long blond hair and eyes of startling blue represents the epitome of beauties of the Norse prosperity.
We are, as you say, that sensible people.
Her English, as well as the English of the majority of the people here, it is absolutely fine.
Nepředvádíme, we do not like flamboyance.
Norway loaded with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of most of the money from this sector invested into a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial collapse, which threw money, the Norwegians had the laces on his purse tight.
"Until we can skiing in winter and summer going on trips, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," she adds with a careless laugh.
Standing in the snow in the queue for something to eat - rakfisku have had enough.
Such an elk burger is certainly something else and is beautifully succulent.
But the evening is stinking fish here.
Hotel, where I live, is one of the many places where is rakfisk for dinner, and where guests choose the best, or rather to smell the most demanding fish.
They have a link to a live television transmission, which is the moderator with bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.
It is like a singing competition Eurovision.
"What the score is for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"
"Here is our scoring, Håvard."
There was applause and laughter.
From his chair fall man, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start
How is emerging Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, looking Will Grant from the BBC on the challenges facing them, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected in a few key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
But could not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but to prevent protesters in access to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Face a daunting task.
Mexico, at the time of the paperwork, the outgoing Felipe Senor Calderon led well economically, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has an estimated took the victim 60 000 lives in six years.
"My government has against the Mexican people a big commitment in reducing the violence," the President said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy, which will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shook hands with the American president, president of Pena Nieta political experience as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leaders are different, and in his old homeland, a populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Direct man.
For example, in the rural town of the Valle del Bravo to it in a good way.
His citizens to the development of tourism in the resort and the building of infrastructure.
In town, you can now go for one of the new motorways, which left Pena Nieto to build. These motorways are a huge improvement from leaky and the rugged roads, which have been previously.
Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and an imposing interactive museum with the issue of climate change.
"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of President Pena Nieta, institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI).
In particular, we hope in interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.
After continuous 81 years in power, the PRI out Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace Los Pinos, within the Party from Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.
And refuses to express opposition characterising the new president, as a man of no substantive content.
It is very straightforward man, very prejudiced with excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state this is not impressed, who is from the former governor of many people.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, cannot be contrast with the cobbled streets of the Valle del Bravo more obvious.
Under a motorway overpasses in many ways recalls the suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
And problems in the Autonomous Community, are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, was called to help the army responding to the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly poignant is violence against women.
Only in the last two years were in wild places next to a huge waste dumps thrown the body of the murdered women.
At a time when he was governor, Pena Nieto was in the State of Mexico murdered more than 1 000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - the place, which is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, critics Pena Nieta say that during his tenure in office failed to adequately tackling the problem of the murders of women.
And, in the worst case, his leadership accuse of escapism.
In the House, representative of the tumbledown neighborhood, me Irinea Buendía shows photos of his deceased daughter Islands Luna and crying.
According to the official version of the committed Marian in 2010 suicide.
Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived in her house, so it seemed as if her body wash," recalls Mrs Buendía.
There were signs of strokes and had begun to rigor mortis.
As her mother tells the story, Marian looking down from the picture on the wall, next to the cross on which is a single word: "Justice".
However, this is, as they say in the family, exactly what they were denied.
Government departments shall treat me as if I was the old gossip, and potížistka kňouralka.
They want you to just accept what they say, and said nothing.
"But it cannot be right, when it came to the many errors and omissions," he says.
Sherpa, president of Pena Nieto Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico hit by violent crime and the new president, said that during his tenure in office will be his priority.
"I hope that it will be the same president, as was the governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo MP PRI Olvera.
But this is precisely what the families of victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning complained on the wrong treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor trying to refute claims Bradley Manning on the rough treatment in custody.
Hearings focus on Manning's resided in military custody in the city of Quantico in Virginia.
The defense wants the case was rejected on the basis of gross treatment with Manningem in prison.
Private is accused of stealing the thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor seeks to demonstrate that, Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest secret of material in the history of the US, many missed opportunities to complain to the rough treatment, which allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor Zaw Ashden Fein in the cruciform questioning Private Manning in a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that records weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of units in the nine months in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of mistreatment.
Cross questioning, occurred during a hearing on the proposal of the defence to the case against Manningovi due to gross treatment at the time of ties, which is in itself sufficient punishment, the day after Manning said in custody contemplating suicide.
Analyst army intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing the thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was published on-line to WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never that Manning was the source of the information.
On Friday the hearing through military prosecutor Fein together with Manningem forms that officers filled after meeting with Manningem in detention in Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011, held in the regime with increased security.
Officers Manningovi putting questions and record his answers.
When he Fein Friday on these forms asked, Manning said that the treatment by their guards evaluated as "excellent" and the total treatment in equipment assessed as "very professional."
The show no complaints of mistreatment, although the officers Manning directly about the way it is handled, Fein said.
Manning said that the concerns relating to the various problems, orally and that the officers, who visited with him about these concerns and have indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, did not.
"They had" no problem "(after discuss concerns), and it did not necessarily mean that I will mention them," said Manning.
Judge PLK. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why the treatment of his person complained in January 2011 for a meeting with the commission examining thoughts of suicide, which a few months earlier expressed in the form.
Manning said that, in the course of this meeting was his intention to achieve a reduction in the regime "injury prevention."
The military said that for him the restrictive regime (one stage under the supervision of suicide) used for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted to guards in custody, knew that I was in order and that I wanted to abolish this scheme for the prevention of injuries... to enjoy increased the quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning on Thursday for his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transported to the detention center on the Marine Corps base in Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait considered suicide, and once there because of the heat fainted.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what will happen to him and what is happening in the rest of the world, it was a very depressing.
"My world is focused only on the base Arifdžán, in the cage," he said Thursday, Manning.
I thought I was gonna die in a cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was only allowed one mattresses, blankets, slippers, clothes and glasses.
He said that he tried to walk, because sleep or just camp was in the day against the rules.
Manning said that always slept with light from the outside his cell in the eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned in the night, on the other hand, woke him and he had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative handed a formal complaint to the treatment with Private Manningem in January 2011.
Manning was in April 2011 moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked the allegations raised in testimony Thursday, on the fact that, after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates in the morning.
Manning testified that in that he was not allowed to hide his blanket.
On Friday, questioning the receiver Manning said that of the orders of their guards decided that has a blanket, which could hide postpone, but admitted that the order to its postponement nobody has gone before.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was last night forced to sleep naked, because he tried to show that he is not dangerous.
Manning said that officer said that he could use the belt of his underwear or their slippers to hurt, but he did not.
Manning testified that the night was from his cell removed his underwear, his slippers and glasses.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account of his experiences during his imprisonment, and that in the case of his conviction in the military, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense has said that the plans that Manning admits to a fault in the lower criminal offences and that will fight against the other charges, because they were too extreme.
At the start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said the statement that Manning was held in accordance with the regulations concerning all arrested held in custody with a maximum security prison.
Among the charges against Manningovi are aiding the enemy, against the law of the publication of the intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis mexicko-American identity
He says that many people have been forced to flee Mexico due to lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame you, what had gone; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that the Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely pushed his way through the crowd and I arrived for the agenda of immigrants, where I came upon the problem.
Arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners)."
I stood there for a few seconds, and I did not know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and all my life I was called "Mexican."
That is ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston, called "Irish" and my friends in New York themselves referred to as "Italy".
So I ended up in the "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I have no vocabulary of native speakers and I can get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment this week, the newly elected President Enrique Pena Nieto visited in the White House by President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual business, which, when the leaders of the two countries will meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also like to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same probability that Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada, and to create in North America trade bloc, similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, and when did not provide any details.
For Mexico is the relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought to the fact that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and its leader forced at gunpoint to overwrite half Mexican territory in the United States.
But for the Mexicans, who is in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So minute after the United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of the complaints about how Americans interference with the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And the children Montezumy steps on the warpath.
And yet it is the real challenge for Mexico to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
Those is a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers options, and others who do not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots lives in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, which was in Mexico denied the opportunity and he had to go to the north.
And more than it seemed, this person in profile - dark skin, poor education, the origin of the poor village, etc.,
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is to the United States.
Beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class does not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
He sees us as a humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never sufficiently strong.
Our existence is, in their view, only about failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, so it never left.
And we are now found no jailed for silk curtain, with the good life in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally traveled to the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is a tension, because the Mexicans more understanding of who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, he sees herself as part of the two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans, I feel like part of one.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also of Bruce Springsteen.
You will get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in one.
In Mexico on us is viewed as the Americans.
And in the United States, we considered Mexicans.
And that relations even more complicated, want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I was in my trip, together with the Diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a makeshift "ambassadors" and represented Mexican interests in the United States.
We should say our American citizens, how good is this country to visit, and push to the political leaders to solidify the relationship with Mexico.
Well.
It is therefore happen.
Too many enemy feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us is not certain, that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that this is for you, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States, as it was with Mexico before one and a half century ago, so he must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feels uncomfortable in this way, with their family members in much closer to the past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we have more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, a new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be a basis for peace.
It can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such matter is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many of the buildings in the rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel ’ s capital, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even when it seems that Israelis and Palestinians trapped in his ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe this will mean that the fight will be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it can suspend their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won or lost.
At first glance, it seems that, at present, there is little reason for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire concluded on 21 November lasted, the fight for this week to strengthen hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which in Gaza since 2007, will argue that the Israelis were forced to retreat, although Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing several leaders of Hamas and the closure of the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the poorest global and most populated corners of the planet, the Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gains influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.
Moreover, they may very well consider Hamas leaders, that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have more influence, so Hamas won the rich and the powerful friends.
Turkey, revived regional power, which was once the Muslim ally Israel, was joined on the side of the Hamas. So Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas say that Islamic crescent around the Israel, to the north of Lebanon, where the party / militia Hezbollah, Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu may unseat Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where allies Hamas threaten the king.
And, above all, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt in 30 years until its fall in 2011, not on Hamas time
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may occur as a player, which cannot be excluded or Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will reach the opposite conclusions.
In military terms was Hamas deposited back into the box.
Israel ’ s Iron Dome antimissile system could have their price and many missiles Hamas was destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - at the moment.
In the diplomatic terminology, America is as hard as always. Many European countries also blaming Hamas from the start of the last round of violence.
And mainly - Israel prospered, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed about 30 Israelis, was in Israel a relatively easy from suicide bombers, in part thanks to the wall, which interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements that growing despite its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party, at the beginning of the campaign in elections held on 22 January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous the Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If it really ruled in the West Bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we stick to the walls and is gonna, when his head.
Maybe hardliners won, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries have Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
The Israeli defense spending are higher than the costs of all his four Arab neighbors together.
The launch of the new war with local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign, and it may be the beginning of something new.
Also the Israelis would be the situation should, in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates the denial of the rights of Palestinians on a barrel of gunpowder, who must one day in the areas Israel occupied explode - as well as the bus, which last week exploded in Tel Aviv.
Already in the current period of repression in the Jewish State, democracy and the demography of this situation is exacerbated by the Arab population is growing.
Bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to push Hamas will be increasingly withdraw diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what they preached reasonable people on both sides, most of the outer world, and these newspapers: Two states, when Israel to the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that the ceasefire will provide the pressures of the outside of at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must commit to stop the supply of arms into Gaza, has a better position than ever, to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside also must push on the correspondence between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state has done more than immediate offer a virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term flabby performances of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be just as reluctant, in its entry into the process.
This is shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable the Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia have entered into force the laws of the bad cigarette packages
On the shabby green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.
Entry into force of the Australian laws on packages of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and logos and paints brands replaced general olive green boxes of ugly images of diseased parts of the body and children and infants as the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are obliged to Saturday the only difference between the brand names, which are printed in the same small print.
This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, that this habit of his attractiveness.
He relies on studies that show that if people start smoking until the age of 26 years, is 99% chance that start smoking never.
"Even in very small children, you can see that means the message that the tobacco companies to jointly with its product to sell," says the Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek, and cites studies that have shown, for example, that the children are in the crown logo with the idea for this to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest levels of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper, more accessible.
"This legislation will be to serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The forgers from China and Indonesia would be much more of these products, which will be sold on the Australian streets.
Another says that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha from society Zico Import Pty Ltd, small family firms, said that the demand on cigarette packaging of the silicon used to cover the gory boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal on laws to Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company Zico has sold almost 6 000 pieces of wholesale distributors and expects the new supplies.
It is for us a good deal.
As possible, experts say the popularity of social media in the demographic group, to which the plan aims.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sport events and demanding that most vendors hid the cigarettes from direct gaze, tobacco marketing moved on-line.
Australia banned internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this little scope to promote your products, is for you on-line space insurmountable place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, research workers in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman recorded an increase in the evaluation of the marks on social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out a "John."
We have to ask, but it is a private citizen, who really loves Marlboro cigarettes, and he took the job and made this video, or in that it involved marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry focused on how to handle the new regulations, than to marketing.
The industry has gone so far that paid Ukraine, Honduras, the Dominican Republic for striking new regulations - countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation, the claim that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that no country with Australia significantly.
The ruling PPW is expected in the middle of 2013.
Minister Plibersek, says that the government had held talks with other governments, which are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.
Canada was the first country in 2001 introduced mandatory warning photographs.
Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
A more stringent laws think Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia.
Pictures of me to have no effect.
Just ignore them.
"I just take out a cigarette and a dip back," says Victor El Hage when buying boxes with photographs of the tumour in his mouth.
Frankly, it is just one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, who own trafiku King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, argues that, thanks to a single packs is harder for him is to offset the shelving.
"The cargo it took me an hour, now it takes four hours," said Yu.
"The government is simply had to prohibit, then we say, okay, this is the end, close thing '," he said, and spread his hands.
In the world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, as our plane mechanical difficulties, and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Wait for a half day at the airport on the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in child development increasingly come with praise nudění.
They say that for us (and our children) is good, sometimes bored.
It has forced the brain to go into interesting guidelines, which can promote creativity.
And whereas most of us today it is constantly connected to a screen, we have a chance to boredom.
We should therefore encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I will come back to this.
Firstly, as well as many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as he says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, which is the author of Boredom: And Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, originating in the first century AD.
And then it is also a question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario in Canada.
After seeing the research literature and demonstration of the thoughts of the target group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as experience "I wanted to do something that would have satisfied me, but I was not capable of it."
Boring, from apathy by that person is involved in anything, but I would like to be.
He says that in apathy, there is no need to do something.
He says that at the heart of boredom is "disruption in the spotlight, associated with a bad mood and a sense of slowly of time."
Boredom may resemble a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, they bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while the people who are depressed, he sees a problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we are, then, if we only have trouble concentrating.
In his study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to an earlier experiment, in which participants in listening to the tape, on which a person read an article in the magazine.
Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others have heard so low that it barely noticed, while a third group heard him at all.
Those who have heard a low, reported more bored than the other two groups - had difficulties in concentration, but they were not sure why these difficulties and the boredom.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or a lively task of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are doing something boring, "as is the search for the bad parts of the factory line, distracting music can help with that, you get bored."
In fact, he said, as we now know, twisting and drawing, which are often viewed as a sign of boredom, may actually help with boredom to fight and to keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to shake, the more you learn and keep more information than those that are forced to sit on it," said Professor Fenske.
We all sometimes bored experienced - delay my flight, the loud speaker, especially the lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance of bored than others.
For help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s have developed Failure "for susceptibility to nudění (" Boredom Proneness Scale).
Scale includes issues such as: "Many things I must do, is repeated and is monotonous," and "I have so many interests, that I have no time to do them all...."
Use these scales scientists discovered that boys tend to be bored more frequently than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular as regards the need to have more and various external stimulation.
Teenagers are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.
But he said that he knows that, "adolescence is a time for boredom", which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people is not given much control of what they want to do.
So, back to my original question: "Is boring for you all right?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to have absurd natural risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the issue for more than two decades.
"Boring is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain is always the best thing you should do.
If you were getting bored and using this energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it.
However, if you watch TV, will you please just for a moment, not in the long term.
So, if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, bored, but will learn how to attach itself or separately drive, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another," said the Professor.
Your child learn just how to attach itself, but will give greater control in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we should not be too critical.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable, when we are out of reach of the activities and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We are accusing her of the need for bored with even more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the free time
"In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is hard to find ways to do when the sound off."
In Colorado is no manual on the new law on marijuana
Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and footballer in southeastern Colorado, face criminal charges for something that will soon be in the state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and pipe, which was used to her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day come with several friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After a policeman found marijuana in the car, it was Mr Orozco issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment to the use of drugs, petty crimes, which is fine for every $100 - and he was a date for the court.
"They were to us as the criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the weeks after the vote on the Colorado legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends response of hundreds of smaller drug cases in place rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington State, which has passed similar measures repealed.
The police department stopped blame adults aged 21 years of age and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains votes to prevent the opening of new, state licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.
"This matter is moving so fast that I do not know what will happen," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The head, gossip and regulators in Washington State.
And looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - all within the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado River, for good or bad, is ahead of most of the states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use, and now a recreational.
"Colorado is more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of the State of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted no place or system can do more than to suggest that might work.
"There is no real precedent, according to which we could manage,", he said.
The Washington law, the I-502, shall take effect on 6 December, which also leaves the annual vacuum in which there will be a state licensing system, but legitimate possession of yes.
And there are complex mechanical issues that during this period shall be resolved, for example, how to balance the directive State on the "appropriate approach" to the licensed marijuana with his trade ban with hemp to 330 yards from the schools, parks, playground or child.
"There will be more difficult to place licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, and especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, a research group.
21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that police "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.
The chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws governing the medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado represents the District Attorney General Ken Buck tighter view.
After the vote, said that his office would continue in the prosecution of cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push on users, to seek treatment.
Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even if many of them are facing another accusation.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal guilt, which was crimes at a time when they occurred," said Mr Buck in its statement.
The response was a complicated and in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city district, adults now blame for possession of a small amount of.
The D.A., Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to totally all ongoing cases of possession.
"I do not think that I was losing my time continuation in law enforcement, until changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state have revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
For the district prosecutors that is "the cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver, which represents accused of possession of marijuana, and the Speaker of the National Organisation for the Reform of marijuana laws.
"They spent so much of her life, people still cannot really accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states, which are to a small amount of marijuana, they like to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on the national test cases for the legalization of drugs.
Barristers and the authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and at the same time also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the sale and the cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates the legalization of marijuana, hoping the Ministry of Justice in.
Despite a few arrests of marijuana for medical purposes and patients who use it to attract attention, most of the federal government business with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 States in traffic.
While protidrogoví agents may not break down the door to pick up a small bag with the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing the state regulated shops with recreational marijuana authorised by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drugs policy administration of President Obama.
Several Colorado towns expects to federal authorities.
Even before the election on some local governments approve moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before he can any trade open.
Last week the Montrose in the western part of the state has proposed the ban, and it is likely that the next week will enter into force.
"We do not want to be in a situation where someone we license, and then we will have a federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at it, what they voted for the municipality, compared to what passed the state.
There is a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave from Oxford, because I am a conservative."
For their views are not only attacked today ’ s college students.
Remember that I ever dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford.
As my father and my older brother, studied at the university, which I think is the world ’ s largest seat of learning, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And yet I am at the end of the 1980s within two weeks after starting at Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases and poured into the scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said, that I gave up because I objected to lovemaking students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said, that I left, because I was forced to drink from the battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.
I was persecuted for one reason and in this cradle of perceived enlightenment that was as a bigot, so barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why this up until now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students to the right of center suffers from similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that the last week a group of these students demanding equal rights, equal protection to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the younger vintages (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, says that because of their political views are often actively "isolated and personal attacks, and they made it clear that they are not welcome."
They want to create a position in a university committee for equal opportunities, to ensure that their views are free to communicate.
Their helped the situation even more recently referred to documentary television BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (a Faery country: Young, intelligent, and right wing) on the student politics, which conservatives described as odd and neo-Nazis.
In the show, he was introduced to a graduate Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University - OUCA), who drove Rolls-Roycem, was dressed in a silver suit and should stick with a silver head.
At other universities conservative students say that it is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees treated as "scapegoats."
A Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told the Sunday newspaper that "leftist influence in universities is growing.
People think that we as the Bullingdon Club, without at all with us. "
A twenty-one-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for more protection, says that the climate is "uncomfortable", while devatenáctiletá elected president OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of the JCR to the people to the right of center worsened.
"This is a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During its first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I started in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative party was nejhorečnatější.
A year earlier University voted to refuse to grant an honest former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even Stalinists shaking with fear.
During the first few days in the opening week, when the new students met among themselves and with professors, I got to taste wormwood, which he had come.
I discovered that not only professors in the goading of conservative students, but to him.
In the paneled classroom was introduced to the policy of mining strikes, privatisation and the resistance of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture on the translation of the French text from the 18th century to English and to what happened, I was not prepared.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "fold please first paragraph."
It was me.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like dortové dough, was much bilious.
"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" He asked.
Other students snickered.
Tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you in their spare time took a basic lesson French, if you are not too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.
Zdrcená I returned to his room.
At dinner in school, I sat alone, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.
It was a sophomore named James, who identified himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, this is so.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.
For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Most conservative freshmen pretends that they are labouristi.
Later, at a local pub, I tried to pretend to be cowardly.
I insisted on it, that I do not agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A student of the first year of the field of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of the fascist pig."
You are infected.
Other students with him notovali.
I was sick, dirty.
"As the conservatives love?" One asked.
Hitting each other, right?
I felt so as to feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead in Oxford a normal life?
I would be forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?
I had to be converted into labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?
Three years before me, developed a purgatory ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative Professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was in my school.
He hated not only for being conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.
Almost there.
He hated this place for its parochialism and pettiness and for his attraction to marxisticko-deterministickému view of history.
In 1997 he got to the place of Professor at Bilkentské University in Turkish Ankara.
"You will not be happy here," he said.
I started to commute from Oxford to house their parents in London, seeking refuge in their dispassionate metropolitan friends and family.
I told Father that Oxford hate and why.
He could not believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s were accepted all political views.
"But it is the best place in the world," said pathetically.
They would not have done this, not in the city of mood.
Even my communist friends had always perfect ways.
His dark eyes were troubled.
Try it again.
I am sure that this is a joke.
It would break my heart, if you left.
Exhausted frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience.
My friend, also a Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and surrendered his conviction.
The following week v průběhu výuky, when another history professor in absolute seriousness, said that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even when I was inside blushed with shame, I admitted to the fact that my parents "brainwashed" and called them "old fools."
The relief was just short.
Nail in the coffin of my Oxford career hammered my father.
In that time, he wrote every week two columns in the newspaper ’ s essential walls.
My door was locked.
I cowered inside and after five minutes of my pursuers.
When they were gone, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me usmrkaným wimp.
But no 18letá girl or boy should not be in education subject to such intimidation and sarcasm.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, of which not only came 14 Tory prime ministers, but also to date, hiding behind the undue reputation with equality and freedom of thought.

The hardest business in the world: Medium of sulphur in the Ijen volcano Kawah
In four of the euro gamble porters in the Indonesian volcano with life and health, when they 70 pounds of sulphur down the steep stone paths.
People are, for which it is the work of hell, and there are those who work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make their living conquest of the sulphur content of Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, each day fárat up at the bottom of the crater, where escapes sulfur gases from inside the Earth, and in contact with air passes into a solid state.
After all the great blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, takes them to his shoulders in the two bamboo baskets of the steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which bars 2 386 feet, it is only 250 metres away, but exhausted bearers takes over 40 minutes before they get to the tortoise pace up, because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected their steps, and McCaskey said'd into the abyss.
They know that any misstep could become life, how it happened one French turistce that years before crashing down from the rocks Kawah Ijen.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which yields
When they are at the top, making their way around the tourists, who is, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and hard to carry the weight that mining company placed a little below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in the volcano has benefited from the 1960 and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sold for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, was also intolerable, as this rock has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, firecrackers, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar.
"Because they are commonly worn by 70 pounds, earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains us Anto, which usually undergo three trips a day.
One way it takes three hours and at the end of it is destroyed, but so can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
While this seems to be a negligible amount in such inhuman effort, it is three times what would be made in the field.
"Daily wage miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee to pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and pay for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his pay 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a valid reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as the sulphur: "I married with a young girl from Bali, which is a Hindu, and I took it on Java, to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, it was hard to breathe, still coughing and eyes has irritated toxic gases
In his 27 years Anto three times a day, risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur, it began to take their toll, though his face protected by a special mask and glasses.
Has asthma, it was hard to breathe, still coughing and eyes has irritated toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for it to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two years, because I want to open trade or study Spanish or French," promises more than English.
This charming and intelligent young man in a fate could be tourist guide, the waiter or the reception in a hotel, and instead of doing the work of the medium.
It shares the dirty wooden shack with other porters, and every day he rises at two in the morning, because the sulphur in the night continues to build up and its characteristic yellow colour change in blue and September through the darkness.
Despite the darkness Para Anto into the crater and illustrates the way a little lamp, which has mounted on his helmet and it myself, for their money.
About 400 media plots on the shoulders of the basket with sulphur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, sulphur mining because of cost savings nezmechanizovala, or provide porters working on his own and with this effort, no equipment.
Nor do not receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the bonus for photography, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the natural park wardens from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," argues, a burly Madrusin 42-year old carrier, who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
 Can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that will work, "as long as possible", because he needs money to the education of their three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I will not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano was my whole life
Although sulphur burn his throat and eyes sting when the wind suddenly turn and trap the miners in the dense fumes from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them nestěžuje that suffer from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems, into arthritis pain, his knees and cuts on his shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik who balances his trash on his back, in his 53 years can load only 50 pounds.
Every day he and his colleagues in vydolují volcano 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three trucks conveying the steep path between the brush into the warehouse in Tamansari remote 18 miles.
"I am not going to retire, die here, because the volcano was my whole life," declares Unainik and opens up the wide mouth, in which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty years old, also makes mining of sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world is sustained from generation to generation - craft, who perform the human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singapurci waged that have no children, on the career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am married, and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot. Let us do their civic duty and zploďme new life!
It may seem incredible that, this slogan is part of the advertising of peppermint candy, but still — or perhaps because of it — the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local hints of type "give a bun in the oven as" makes a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising agency but that video, hopes that they this advertising will be able to draw attention to the problem of humorous way.
Artistic Director of the Agency Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of the music to people as "my civic duty."
"It is entirely a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem with this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we have the feeling that this is a topic which we must touch.
We knew that the government attempted to about a lot of things like to extend the perfumes with pheromones or organise familiarisation parties.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not fully operational.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing, as is the composition of rap, in order to solve this problem. "
1.2 children
The one who is not too lightly, the Singapore government.
A year spent 1 USD 300 to encourage people to have more children.
Government package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars for a child, extended maternity leave and the allocation of financial benefits.
All these measures but had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technologies in southeast Asia, also known conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 to womanhood.
Most recently, fertility rates 2, which is considered to be a degree of recovery, in 1976.
Why Singapurci have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, Director of marriage and the family of the National Bureau for the population, says that it is because of the "better education" and "a broader range of career opportunities."
"People that are available to a wide range of options, with regard to the objectives and priorities, it is not only the marriage and family," explains.
These changes in social standards contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. The result is a reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
While in the immigration policy existed to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as the measures against the decrease in the number of inhabitants, between the local population that has caused resentment.
On some of the Singapore Web site is to see explicit xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low salaries and a little effort to integration.
Increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year has seen government party Singapore its worst electoral outcome from the beginning of independence.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem by quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates is unknown impact on national economic growth, tax revenue, spending on health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government tries to be not so many small home.
For example, began to have an effect on trade with real estate.
The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "a shoe box", which can build in some urban areas.
These apartments are area 46 square meters and had great success in marketability.
However, there is concern that these flats can encourage a bachelor lifestyle and deter developers to build a large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developers EL Developers, claims that their "shoe box" are far more quickly than larger houses.
"They are more popular, and so that is sold for days and weeks faster than houses with larger area.
Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "
However, admits that the new standards are the clearer rules developers who have previously been restrained, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one of the project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city state.
Although the new rules could be heading for an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the center of the city suggests that will have a major effect.
"People are still in the stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people have been postponed," says a young officer.
"The rest of you have children.
But it is important to me to rely on his own time and money, "said another, about a young man.
Men and women they cite the career, stress and the cost of living and education as those which prevents them from having children.
So, whether the government is trying to citizens as forced to have children, they are all ultimately Singapurci, on the creation of a family who have the last word.
What is the private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Spanish Academy is something that has a personal nature or a "area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption."
What is this privacy for a man of up to 16 years?
How applies this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
He understands the dangers, which is produced when published on the internet, which would certainly anyone in normal communication said?
Journalists from elPeriódico to five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, as the concept of privacy for "something very own", on a personal level, and for "user name and password", was a social network.
"Has the greatest secret I reported it," says a Jorge in order to explain the importance of privacy at places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"On FB I give a nice photos or pictures, how we play.
He also says there is known.
He would picture, which would not be mine, or picture, which would be someone zesměšnila, "he says.

Nor would he cared about, if someone has told someone unknown.
The case of fourteen José is different.
This teenager own accounts on networks Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at last the network admits that knows no 20 people from his list of friends.
"I do not fear, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.

Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and a graduate of the Education and class, it is considered that in children and adolescents in the social networks guiding correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
It states that: "The Internet was created as a means for finding information, but when the social network, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of Education at Yale University and the author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"The digital natives are children and young people, who were born in the time of this technology.
We are the digital immigrants who is we need to learn, and they only learn, "he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we are asking them to, they could see that it is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what not, in an age when that are not yet ready."
Also to be - as regards surroundings - reasonable, at a time when what most yearn to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.
According to this Specialist is the most effective way to children and adolescents to show what it is private, asking questions, which makes them think.
"Tell them to do, they did not work," he adds.
Further Marrielos Porrasová enumerates the some of the options: There are things you a stranger told, so why are you doing on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone has published a picture of you as you published kamarádovu?
Do you know what the other published?
When are you calling people on the photos of the celebrations, you asked for these people permission?
And one more: Need constantly all know, what are you doing?
Another point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside.
They are the same rules.
"A man outside of the Internet by respect, morality and other principles and the same it should be on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at first instance and educational advisor explains that it is necessary to parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If every understanding of guile, have a good basis to with the kids talked about the consequences that the account on the Internet can have.
For example, with regard to age or what is allowed to share or publish, "he says.
 Guardia is of the opinion that it is key to resemble children traditional rule "talk to strangers."

Rafael Correa: South America must learn the integration of Europe
Ecuador ’ s president, Rafael Correa, announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the aim, in which "the South America, in this case, you really must learn from Europe."
Correa, who had been in the sixth presidential summit Jihoamerické EU Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that Europeans "killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but are now virtually one country."
In this sense, defended the project of a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any of the countries of South America, which is underway between members of the Andean Community, however, there are backward areas, which we want to return to the past," he said.

"Those who are in the lead, with nothing, and the South Americans, on the contrary, we all sign.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter- Human Rights Commission in Washington is financed by the United States, "he said in reference to the political asylum granted to Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa has confirmed that this decision regretted because it betrayed their principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He said that, at the time, "there was a suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."
In addition, Swedish criticised the judiciary, who asked him to the Swedish territory to questioning about alleged sexual offence, with its own "Swedish legislation allows you to hear witnesses videoconferencing conversation, which could carry out from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that Assange of physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken to him since it is on our embassy, but Ambassador informed me that my small lung problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorean head of state.
"But the danger that his physical and mental condition deteriorates, because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would have affected the health of everyone, "he said.
President Correa said that the solution to asylum granted since June Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, on the basis of an authorisation, which enables him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that, with London talks to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We on human rights are not negotiating, such a word in this case, but we were constantly talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because the lawyer Assangeův Baltazar Garzón has led a series of proceedings in the various European instances, "said.
He said that "if Britain will pass tomorrow, everything ends."
And if Sweden will listen to Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or via Skype, as no problem enables its legislation and how it was carried out in other cases, tomorrow will end this problem. "
Correa take advantage of this situation to be presented as a defender of the freedom of the press, and explained that he tolerates "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie to undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of a free press is not us, crooked and perverts politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, "he said.
From this point of view, expressed joy that even these journalists, "or the bankers, or hegemonic countries and even bourgeoisie are not proficient in Ecuador," and said that, if elected again, "will also continue to change led by the right way, and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto expressed Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur, at least until the next elections, and argued that a whole "must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus wrapped in the legality", because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, Ecuador ’ s president, said that the "entirely appropriate" wish his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the period after the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, who ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is not accepted.
"It is a problem between Central and South American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome will walk together.
It is necessary to assess the broad, in order to overcome and was able to go forward. "
Also expressed the hope in the settlement of the maritime border, which is the same court Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that it is "for Latin America right to search for international instance, if both countries commit to accept the judgment, no matter how hard."
In connection with the possibility that he will stand as a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador to apply in order for a third mandate, he said, that he sees this option "with great optimism and pleasure, even if it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if in February 2013 elections loses, leaves from public life.
"I personally never cared much, but so unfair situation, such as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador, can only to political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who makes this unlikely victory, so we must take this responsibility, "he said.
"If I win, it would be my last term, and then I went from politics.
If we lose, I did the same thing.
I decided, "he said.
Correa is also mentioned on the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez has left for the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the health status of the president, "he explained.

Victims of AIDS today are the result of a late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 when he was confirmed by the results of the test: HIV positive.
"It was as if to hit me with lightning," tells the memory for a moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "a bit", but without success.
The boy that a family secret.
He decided to take his illness on their shoulders, and began to inform her... And it with such vigor that celebrated his birthday 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients Units HIV in Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (gonadotropin), which came in 1994 after a few battles with the disease.
Fabrizio resides with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was inconceivable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and the greater the stigma.
Then, with the director of the clinic of the Institute of Social Security (IMSS) saying, "because he had cut."
Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and to live fully.
It is, however, a lot of people who know about his illness and, when the virus has caused destruction of the organism and conflict in himself immune system, and then they become victims of random infections.
31 years since the world was AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success, that the life expectancy of the patient, who in good time and in an appropriate manner starts with treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV in Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and a specialist in HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that the scientists concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full of life depends on the level of disability immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, which are better for those who are not taking the drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells of up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the one who is HIV has been diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with the treatment of live without problems of up to 75 years," said in an interview with the doctor.
To underline this progress, it is recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although the mortality rate decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (almanac of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics 60 percent of patients.
In the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year, so far, 187. However, since 2005 is secured through universal access to antiretroviral therapy.
 - Why continue to people on the consequences of the illness die?
 - "it seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
The way I see it, this is how it happens to us in the hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of the medical supplies. The problem is that patients are coming at a very advanced stage, because they do not know the condition of the disease, which in late stage of the disease. "
Add compelling figure: "Nine out of 10 patients, when it will be some Associated infection. All that needs to be done, we can affect the overall mortality, before the disease is diagnosed, and therefore it should be on a large scale to offer testing for the disease to all persons who requests it."
In its draft coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to do the tests in a private lab just because he did his friend, and despite its low age with him for the disease, AIDS and also suffered Kaposi s sarcoma, cancer, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they die, and they do not want to know anything else.
"If I am to die, you three times a week vyřádím," they say, but that is not the case.
The change was for the better, touching it, I practice, I take drugs. "
Today his parents knew only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life as any.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I run active sex life, but responsibly, I give attention to himself and to the other person, "enumerates the Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge, to share their experiences with the diary MILENIO Jalisco to today, on World AIDS Day encouraged his testament to those who are afraid.
"Whatever they do tests. If risk, so let him know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, this is a better... And if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live as anyone else, as will be held accountable."
This his message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programmes for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who reveal information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places, which is this task, "actually increased handing out condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," said.
Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want?" Is the document in question is full of irony and assessment from the social workers, school counselors, employees pharmacies and medical staff that adolescents want to avoid, says reporter.
He suggested this inefficient allocation of change. Whether condoms are not only for consoles, but a hundred whatever is in dávkovačích public toilet, in places where a young.
"It is not promoting promiscuity.
Nor is not about the "pay them beer and motel", as he reacted Governor Emilio Gonzalez to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district.
Takovásexualita. It is best to make condoms to those who had sex life, "he said.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
It was recorded 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 HIV cases).
This means in Mexico fourth place in the new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th in connection with HIV.
92% of the diseases is sexual way, 6% of the blood the way y 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that, with the HIV virus can live about 50,000 people, as a registered case is four to five people who know about the disease.
The judgment of the court of appeal of the United States, which does not recognise debt restructuring company Grupo Vitro provided for the audition in Mexico, raises an unfortunate precedent for any national firm with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the restructuring of companies, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of Stars and Stripes, despite international agreements.
The approval of a judgment issued on 15 June last year judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court, for the North Texas leaves in the practice of Mexican companies without a defense against the confiscation of their property, on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the Mexican producers glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against the three irregularities.
First of all it should be said that while the judge this causes claims that the creditors have to manage the Insolvency Act of the United States Court of Appeal Fifth district in New Orleans, says that the procedure, the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of multinational enterprises.
In fact, it was for this purpose, created a model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which the Arbiter specifies the organisation of American Law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling provides that without a vote branches of internal corporate structure, which is recognised by a debt to the parent company Vitro subsidiaries, would not be achieved the most to the approval of the restructuring.
However, the possibility of Mexican laws.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was the first, in which it was taken this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose transfer debts guaranteed by the Federal bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of branches of creditors - who against the company Vitro stood before a court in the United States, i.e. funds "vultures", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - had the most.
In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal.
From another perspective, accuses the company of Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008, against the background of the serious economic crisis, which struck in the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal to the new assessment at the Court of Appeal that assessment to full participation, with the participation of the five judges, because originally voted only three.
If that fails, it will require a revision of the process of higher instances, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The situation is serious, that the Court failed to document sent to the Mexican government service as amicus curiae, in which it is described in detail by the company Vitro under bankruptcy law and in which points out that the company had eased by opted to agreements signed by the two countries that had confronted the law with Chapter 15 insolvency law of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country has subjected the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that is, the rules for international defaults, guaranteeing equality for debtors and creditors.
The impact on both sides: Punishment for company Vitro and the state.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world traveler Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was with this sálovým sport linked more than 60 years and traveled with him throughout the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories in the history of the local basketball, as has the Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before him in 2008 has attracted stroke to the wheelchair, dedicated to the sport after more than 60 years, either as a player under categories, the player National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach team Vaqueros de Bayamón in national basketball league, or President Portorické Basketball Federation.
"I was in the course of his life in basketball many roles, including some at the same time, as when I was in the 1990s, president of the National League BSN, the executive director of the national team, and the President of the Federation," he remembered Reyes when visiting reporters newspaper Primera Hora at her home in Bayamónu, where she lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes in his assertion no exaggeration.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos of pizza parlours and sweetshops in his long career, show it.
In the heart of Bayamón
With the emotion of all are those that are reminiscent of his tenure in los Vaqueros since the 1950s, where he was player until 1982, when the celebrated 15 years as a joint owner or the owner of the team.
"It was my best years, that I had enjoyed, because I had the opportunity to be with the team los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, joint owner, or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I got one šampionátem farewell - in 1981, when in BSN debuted Jerome Mincy.
When the team took over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader, "said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, which was formerly coach, and by that time he worked at the University of Birmingham University, told me:" I got you a big player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players, in Puerto Rico.
Bartow me then recommended rozehrávače Raymond Gausseho who became a member of the team, and one of our best marksmen.
I remember that he said that if Mincy will bring Bayamonu victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to further. "
Championship when he played for a team los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, because in 1988, has pursued post of President of Basketball Federation.
In that time, he wanted to pay their functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
"I remember, for the first time, we beat the United States in the Olympic qualification game in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we left off neighborhoods, but we should have a bronze except Canadian arbitration, which left us to repeat the final inserting, "Reyes said.
A team from the World Cup in 1990 best national team, which you have ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one who had defeated the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we throw the team of the United States, which was quite similar, which blew a bronze at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of injuries of the knee.
The team, which might not have the perfect composition, but could we win the gold medal and bring great joy, the men were from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentine Neuquénu.
With players on the roster, as they were "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced player excluded because of the skirmish in Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions have won the gold.
What was the best player in the Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
None of the Puerto Rico reach this level of such results as Piculín.
Not to mention his tenure in the minor leagues, where he played.
Who was the best portorickým coach?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good generation to which it belongs Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
From young, I very much like the work of Leo Arilla.
Their success in the Federation is the biggest?
That I was part of the most famous era national team in the years 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s was the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.
 What you missed prove?
There are things I wanted to introduce, as the youth categories according to the regions.
For example, that boys from Ponce played only in their own area and rivals with teams from other parts of the island in the play-off.
Now children travel a lot and play too games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and umpires.
That pleases me.
What are you now?
The most I listen to music, I look on YouTube videos with the music of my time, I enjoy grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
