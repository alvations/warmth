The stock of Prague ended with fewer points at the end of the day 
After the rapid decline of the morning, the Stock Exchange of Prague revised its losses. 
Transactions of the actions of ČEZ approximately reached half of their value in a normal day. 
The stock of Prague, at the start of trading Tuesday, immediately reacted to the fall of the Monday when around fell to 6%. 
The fall in this time is due to the decline of the actions on Wall Street. 
Also here is the reaction of the market before the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives that refused to support the plan of stabilisation of the secretary of the financial sector. 
Fall of actions in Asia 
The actions of the stock markets Asian lived on Tuesday a dramatic decline, but the day the index finally has actually part of the losses. 
The index of the stock market Hang Seng Hong Kong over its financial hours almost marked a four percent, although later ended up diluting their losses by reducing the decline in almost a 2.5 per cent. 
The rate of Hang Seng Medium-sized China that is still the movements of the Chinese shares of Hong Kong fell 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai, the markets were closed. 
The actions of the City of Sydney lost more than 5%, but, in the end, the losses dropped 4.3 percent. 
The stock of Taiwan in the Index fell to 3.6%. 
"The actions of rescue scheduled in US are unsafe and this influences in the financial market in the world," said the head of the Office of the currency of Hong Kong, Joseph Yam. 
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it deflected determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence of the Central Bank of China. 
The interest rates of Hong Kong are the same level as those of the United States. 
American lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system. 
Otherwise, threat falls will be in other countries. 
Bloody bathroom of American 
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to aid the financial system which should spend 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kroner). 
The lawmakers, in that way, ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support his plan. 
For Bush, the plan would eliminate the root causes of the financial crisis and would help to stabilise the economy. 
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bathing and mainly the index of the actions picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones fell to nearly seven per cent, a fall of volume similar recorded last time in 1987. 
The index already fell before being announced but it emerged that the proposal of the assembly not forward went out, the index began to freely. 
The congress is cut: The US government can inject $700 billion in banking 
The most senior representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the system of American finance. 
Your vote will take place at the beginning of next week. 
The Americans legislators have provoked a divide in the talks on the approval of the bailout plan in the form of aid to the American system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner). 
However, it is not yet won. 
The Congress must refine some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it will be adopted. 
The plan to aid the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives. 
He said Sunday at the Reuters news agency, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and of Banks of the House. 
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate before Wednesday. 
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market. 
Later, however, will be the "desencantamiento" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid market also established in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"Have made a breakthrough. 
Solve our opinions on the way to the package of measures to stabilize the market "said the Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to the agency Bloomberg. 
Here, the final vote could still be Sunday. 
Representatives of the legislators gathered Sunday evening with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form the government. 
This should purchase of financial companies' assets mortgage not sold to financial firms to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system. 
"We are about to close the convention on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market. 
We need to proceed with the plan, but I believe that we are already in it, "Paulson said. 
A signal for business Asian 
The global financial crisis clearly falls in the stock market falling rapidly. 
According to the Democratic senator from Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are doing everything possible to ensure that Congress approved a deal Sunday. 
They want this reassure business of investors before the market of Asian finances because these are the people who are in first Eastern time and where Congress could influence the trade Monday. 
For now, however, nothing is clear with certainty when vote in both chambers of Congress and, even, if not stagnate at the last minute with a problem. 
The lawmakers believe that it will be approved in the next few days. 
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes. 
The total amount committed to help the system must be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush. 
However, the Congress can block the release of the remaining quantity if he had the impression that the programme is not doing his job, what would it be other $100 billion and, later, of 350 billion dollars. 
Bush put the progress of the meetings 
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes. 
Despite these changes was retained the whole idea of the programme that was to win financial resources for the buyout of bad mortgage securities whose value collapsed because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish on their mortgages. 
"Worked. 
The House of Representatives would be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "said the Republican senator, Judd Gregg. 
The American Bush is pleased with the progress of the meetings. 
His spokesman, Fratto Tony, announced that Bush is pleased with the progress of Saturday and appreciated "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy." 
Limiting the contract cocooned 
The chairman of the Banking Committee senate, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the lawmakers voted on the responsibility of the money from the programme for the protection of the tax payers of their losses, a closing aliviadora of plan of finances scheduled. 
The new law also must limit so-called contracts armoured for directors of societies of the programme, and creates a committee which will take control of the fund. 
This should lead the Finance Ministry. 
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a breakthrough in the direction of the convention will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said. 
The plan also help to homeowners who have problems with their payments. 
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payment that buys in order to lower the monthly costs of payments to deadlines of borrowers and bringing up children that they stay with their homes. 
Marek: aid psychological 
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea to do but rather ponderous. 
"And that is why we do not know what mechanism and at what price it will buy assets problematic. 
This will be critical to the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week, for the server iHNed.cz. 
The plan is now approved or early next week is not, according Marek, so relevant. 
"Is far more important is that, as this week, the U.S. Congress will agree on their support and give you everything before they can be. 
This important and psychological agreement of this is, at present, more important, "insisted Marek. 
Fight armed: the Reproductor MP3 against the mobile. 
We advise her as choose 
While almost all mobile reproduces archives of MP3, no player of MP3 manages to make calls. 
What seems clear that it is better to only buy the phone. 
Yet there are sufficient grounds for the man only acquires the player. 
The election virtually depends on the extent of their use and of the demands of future owner. 
Will probably be difficult that gets the most modern tocadiscos to listen to the last album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
For this type of music products such as the discs of LP no longer, and in terms of its quality there is not one single objective reason to further by buying them. 
If amassed on their shelves the discs monomer with music of Rule rock, jazz or blues, is probably dreaming, at least, this kind of tocadiscos. 
This is the same with music that is under way, that is, the music comprimida, simplified - the music in the MP3. 
And here are categories of price and quality. 
For some it may be unacceptable spend eight thousand kroner in a media player, the same as for a lover of Pink Floyd that hardly future of bazaar of twenty. 
Two extremes, including enough space for each. 
The choice is wide. 
Also decides the duration of the battery 
Some of the best players much do more than just reproducing music and even something that not even the majority of mobile. 
No current machinery is as universal as the telephone. 
The most basic functions as telephone call, send messages, can reproduce music and video, recording two, has a better or worse apparatus of photograph and until you get to navigate. 
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDA are going to have in your pocket also a small computer. 
This is a small miracle because no fridge knows a roast and no television can. 
The universality of the mobile us also has drawbacks. 
The more functions used in the mobile before light up the scoreboard screen asking to be stretched. 
And the reproduction of music is one of the biggest tragones of energy. 
Few are mobile that manage to reproduce music more of ten or twelve hours, the majority. 
In this sense, the music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a better performance. 
For this reason, please note that the mobile cheap not start for two hours. 
If only this, above, constantly knocking still consíganse, for more safety, a freighter for the job - that is even true for the most expensive equipment. 
With the reproductive MP3 this problem will not have, since even worse with at least 9 hours of continuous operation after a burden. 
Another problem is the film music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, only a part of the universal USB conector and, moreover, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software. 
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the card of memory but only in some units readers without loss can plug small cards that are used in mobile. 
In the players, with one exception (iPod), it is not necessary any special software. 
Enough to fill the apparatus with music through USB computer. 
The majority of mobile and players create alone its agenda in the music library under the name of the performer, title of the album, gender or also according to the assessment of user. 
Some devices only show a here with structure of tree similar to a Buscador Windows and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones operating system). 
The reproductive seeks to serve, the mobile knows more 
For the election of a particular team interésese by the resistance of the accumulator, by the ability of the memory, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the comfort of its handling. 
If you listen, above all, the music as fund and is going to hear every day only now, as in the tram, then enough any mobile reflecting. 
Virtually truly succeed any mobile. 
Should not even consider the format in which the mobile or the reproductive replicate the music. 
The MP3 it all and, almost, almost the entire music that she will be in this format. 
It is among the most widespread and except him the absolute majority of reproducing music format WMA. 
The least include the format PCA (format used by the company Apple and its iPod). 
The best mobile also facilitates, for example, the purchase of music online. 
Enough through the Internet in the mobile visit the competent pages of (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album. 
This service may be alone a convincing argument for a mobile for music. 
Unfortunately the supply of operators is miserable and most just limited to the issues of fleeting success of radios. 
The prices are lower. 
In general, however, is that this way of selling music (by GSM, internet or internet wireless) in the future will dominate the music industry. 
The majority of the people always has a mobile. 
Always who cares to hear something, they will find the mobile device in your pocket, while the reproductive MP3 will be forgotten at home. 
However, still depends if always brings a set of headphones or, at least, the handsfree. 
If not, can use a reproductive integrated that has virtually every mobile but is at least a reproductive MP3. 
Probably the biggest benefit for many of mobile music will be its price. 
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand. 
Between three and four billion kroner already can buy a good walkman. 
The majority of you the absence of a ticket for classic headphones. 
The best, even on the technical side, as the equipped phones with a entry of 3.5 mm for classic headphones, cost up to 15,000. 
Again, the advantage of players is that its service. 
The more players - not necessarily cheaper (see our selection) - the really has any person. 
The minimum functions, its management, similar to the previous currents cassettes or even the tocadiscos is obvious. 
Does not represent a threat by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile and, consequently, giant account by lowering of data. 
By what machine decided 
Even the mobile cheaper (for example, the Vodafone 527) have generally a slot to change the card memory (M2, micro SD, etc.). 
Even with the purchase of a card right to the two thousand kroner. 
However, be careful. 
The basic models, are usually equipped only with a card of 2 GB of maximum capacity. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If already has a mobile and wants to still buy a cheap player of MP3, takes a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
According to the capacity (as maximum 2 GB) only spend 1.1 kroner. 
If it is considered among the most demanding fans of the music takes hold of the móviles-walkman more specialized (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have separate use for MP3 what makes such a comfortable service like the same player. 
The most qualified of all is Sony Ericsson, the mobile line walkman almost have identical use as a reproductive MP3 independent. 
The same service and the same category in terms of price, on the four billion kronor, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a yield of up to 35 hours), the label said arria them into MP3 players. 
The first virtual operator already will rise this year, to the Czech Republic. 
Probably 
The market of mobile in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators practically offer all services as its partners of Western Europe. 
Here, however, we still lack something - the virtual operator, that would force those to be cheap. 
Probably will not be long in coming. 
The Czechs operators are part of the highest in Europe, we have written in mobil.cz. 
The rest is also confirmed the Office of the Czech There's (ČTÚ) that warned that the price of the SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of the rates of roaming is probable a paradoxical situation - for some customers of operators mobile Czechs the SMS that sent from abroad cheaper if sent home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, lack competition that really wants to fight. 
Probably this sound paradoxical, because we have three mobile and its cover is of more than 100%. 
On the contrary, the operators of mobile like them complaining that in the Czech market there is an extreme competition. 
Also the chairman of the Council of the Office of Czech Telecommunications (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, said that there is no place in the Czech Republic to any other operator. 
Perhaps it is true that for a classic operator with their own network already has too many opportunities (for the rest, would be difficult to find any frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator. 
The entry of virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in prices to which they also react the classic operators. 
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile market in Britain there were voices both similar beyond as here. 
It was proven that there is a place for this sort of operators and that can succeed. 
Moreover, does not need to seek examples too far. 
In February of this year we report on the debut of virtual Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half a year, the operator did more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator of the neighbouring country. 
Moreover, after Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U: fon. 
The advantage of virtual operators is concentrate on many more groups concrete goal. 
Moreover, so that they can function effectively, they just need far fewer customers that a classic operator. 
No relative with large expenditure in construction, operation and maintenance of the network. 
In the world this kind of virtual operators normally emerge with low costs - offer calls and messages of cheap SMS that, however, often contrasts with the supply of services as tight. 
So, for example, mobile Tesco in Britain offers SMS at least half of cheap compared with the competition. 
However, as demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a good coup also opting for a trivial target group. 
This operator is specifically designed to man. 
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who like and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say whether similar concept as Poland could bound in our country. 
This doubt the spokesman of Vodafone, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for access by segments in which most of virtual operators. 
Apart from the point of view of the supply of services is not saturated " 
In the Czech Republic not, operators say mobile 
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic will virtual operator that will not be Mobilking. 
"We're talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the R. Czech does not seem so hopeful. 
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region, "he said in a telephone conversation to mobil.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesman of the financial Penta group. 
Indirectly assured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic definitely not submit to this idea. 
Quite the opposite, trying to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition. 
Interest on the launch of a virtual operator of mobile already shows the GTS Novera that I would take a further step forward to become a real competition from Telefonica O2 in the field of customers of businesses. 
"Have a great interest in this, in order to offer our customers not only services of fixed but also of mobile telephony. 
And the sooner, the better. 
With this possibility we have repeatedly found with all the Czechs mobile operators. 
With some of them have made progress in the meetings, "said the spokesman of the group, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, perhaps blinking better times. 
It seems that, for information not official, the first official operator would probably come at the end of the year. 
But for now his emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence. 
"Now believe that the situation is good for the development of a virtual operator in the Czech market. 
The Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market. 
So no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this area ", he said to mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman of Telefonica O2. 
Of the specificity of Czech market are other operators. 
The spokesman of T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional next with the view of O2, adds: Even today we have not been any commercial viable project, bilaterally good, can continue to develop. " 
And he adds: "In the network of T-Mobile will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year. 
Already we should have some specific contract that possible study in such a short horizon " 
Vodafone direct its attention more to compliance with the requirements of a licence 3G. 
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is the situation in sharing of costs and infrastructure. 
Precisely what we see as the biggest contribution from the point of view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field is in the partner with whom to create a shared network for fast Internet in the vehicle. " 
Responsible offices - with operators breakneck speed and meat 
The progress of the operators of mobile can easily understood, but the entry of another operator would increase competition leading to lower prices and a fall in profits. 
So why facilitate the entry to the competition? 
When operators want to achieve something, are capable of throwing a concert, proof of this is the agarrón when it emerged U: fon. 
Perhaps the pressure ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U: fon by the society T-Mobile presenting. 
Witness the accessible public information on the websites of the ČTÚ. 
But now U: fon is an argument for why not accept a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová adds: "Ademas, not so long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was open to a fourth operator. 
As to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is natural that the entry of another player in the market would mean for him, and especially for its large requirements services. " 
That is why this access to operators of mobile is extremely disappointing due to the total lack of regulator Czech. 
Not only is the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competition in the commercial contracts, unlike Britain and other developed countries. 
This purely belongs to the Office for the Protection of Marketing Licitaciones (ÚOHS). 
However, it was typical stance on this issue. 
"The entry of a virtual operator the mobile phone market would be possible after ending a convention on the lease of the necessary infrastructure between an operator of mobile phone and a virtual operator. 
Until today no convention has been closed that the supply of the potential more interested was not sufficiently interesting for traditional operators, "he added to our question Kristián Chalupa, of the department of external relations of the ÚOHS. 
These made statements not surprised by the representatives of the operators. 
For the offices that should represent the interests of the consumers it is more than a point, but they note that no one takes advantage of its position in the market. 
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators running normally we can see that his entry into the market contributed to the drop in price of mobile telephony services" 
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the media market and the price drop do not fall within the interest of the ÚOHS. 
Really dramatically shocking in this whole case is the dissonant reactions that results from the three mobile operators. 
The question of whether it is a coincidence, offers by itself. 
It is the same as with the price of petrol at the pump because it is clear that the work of the chance and a hard fight for the competition. 
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and is therefore to somehow intervene. 
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility for its actions in the market. 
The tools necessary to open up the mobile phone market to virtual operators, are missing, and the regulators of telecommunications, "he added to his response Chalupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many sticking points. 
There obviously is an analysis of relevant markets produced by the ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of trade to tender a single market. 
In this kind of market of course none of the Czechs operators has a dominant position. 
But some legal experts have a vision, to establish a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement with the administrator of the network. 
And the operator of the mobile phone - with all its logic - has the monopoly on its network. 
Therefore, in a segment particular must necessarily be dominant. 
And if this was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS should represent a warning that three operators of mobile conspicuously amount of Georgia. 
The current complaints of stakeholders (inluida the aforementioned society GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators are clashing with many obstacles. 
Place the responsibility in the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick on telecommunications and the ÚOHS washes its hands in all this. 
We met him already in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately not long ago was presented a new amendment to the law of telecommunications for the enlargement of the competition of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial contracts not effect, even when a series of specialists promised that the situation would improve. 
This must understand exactly the representatives of ÚOHS, but it is obvious that their interests are elsewhere. 
Okay, when nobody looks 
At the same time, backdoor, continues as a pseudovirtual operator that networks of mobile phone Czech because there are a few. 
They put their own prices to mobile telephony services that, however, only a part are public. 
Normally is companies marketing multilevel. 
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other offer their own mobile telephony services. 
Normally only some elected managing the list prices of these companies. 
The magic is in the company, with regard to the consummate, acts as a classic corporate customer just putting a lot of SIM cards. 
As special customer will receive special prices and other services. 
The problem is that trading conditions in all the Czechs mobile phone operators prohibit such resale. 
"If discovered cases such as that meeting could be said of the conditions of contract that could result in the end of the collaboration with the society given", responded to the question on this problem Martina Kemrová. 
But it is unlikely that activity of this kind conducted by operators mobile phone not to responsible people. 
In the case of the three companies involved can be of thousands of customers. 
None of the operators are against this procedure. 
With the activities of these enterprises make a considerable gains and, at the same time - unlike the real and virtual operators - no way threaten its own official marketing. 
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the potential problems: "the law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are only used by a small percentage of customers. 
These, too, must accept that the SIM card in your phone is not to his name so they can dispose of it as a normal customer of the operator ". 
That is precisely what should appear at the ČTÚ minimally strange. 
Besides a new question to the ÚOHS. 
If the operators of mobile entornan the eyes in this type of procedure, why blocking the entrance of virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has sufficient competition to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want must not be content with the explanations of the operators that have no idea of the story and that their conditions trade does not allow it. 
When will continue to be the most expensive 
As it became clear in the text, the entry of virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in the prices of the services. 
At the same time, in almost all the countries where the virtual operator, the classic operators more tried or less protected this incursion. 
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc. 
In the most advanced countries, however, have spoken the regulatory bodies and in both cases if the operators but their customers. 
Either with formal or informal pressure ensured that the first virtual operator and with him began to emerge more. 
Unfortunately, the Czech Unit of Regulatory this whole case is like a resort. 
For our experience of amazed us that the confusion of these cases for them. 
But we do not desesperemos. 
If this information scenes is correct and virtual operator actually arrives at these lands, then the Czech market mobile telephony probably started to move again. 
If any of the operator admitted to some virtual operator of mobile phone will be difficult for the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of others. 
And we may make more draw expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Elect the best 
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the anthem official Czech. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the celebrations official Czech presented the new official recording of the anthem scoffed, my home. 
The new anthem recorded the orchestra National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
There are available to four versions - two versions that are Solos, a to male voice and another to female voice, another with Coro and other instruments. 
The song was Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček. 
In the server iHNed.cz can hear the four versions. 
Bělohlávek considers this song domestic Czech as one of the most beautiful tunes. 
The Czech Radio before said that intentionally selected for the Solos singers with representativamente young people voices that are more express and popular. 
"From the beginning I tried with the two, and then, too, with the Coro to be set in the dicción so that the text is understood to have line," she said. 
The official Czech celebrates the next year its 175 anniversary. 
The song where, my Home went off for the first time in the year 1834 in the tables of the Theater of the states in the original work Czech Fidlovačka Josef Kajetán Tyl and managed with the music of František Škroup. 
He won popularity and people by. 
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 became, naturally, in a part of the official anthem. 
One of the seven official symbols even remained after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic. 
How the "new" anthem 
The MHD of Prague leads us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, writes in the history of the Enterprise Transport of Prague the date on which the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bond in their pockets in once a ticket of role. 
This can be bought by almost one hundred thousand people who possess the card Opencard chip. 
Passengers can buy the bonus of 30 days, 90 days and the annual (this will be used from 1 January 2009) and load in your card of the chip in infocentros and jobs the transport company in the seasons underground, Muzeum, Můstek, Holešovice Nádraží, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
The bonds can already buy since yesterday in internet in the pages of transport company, www.dpp.cz. 
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people. 
Those who begin to use the Internet as a form of trade, they can finally begin to forget about the jobs of ticket sales in the stations metro, where until now regularly had to queue for a normal ticket. 
The bonus is bought on the Internet, and the Opencard card you the can in some of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library. 
"In these places are available to passengers a shop with staff prepared to help people with buying over the Internet and with the aquifer of the bond bought in your card," said the spokesman, Martin Opatrný. 
Apart from the library, we will be able to recharge the electronic bond in the Opencard in machines automatic vending in some vestibules metro. 
How are these vending machines? 
Are red, with a jump notes and passengers probably will have set in these times of metro Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Now there are in the town five but at the end of the year should have 1980s", completed Opatrný. 
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of driver 
The use of the machine, which will start to work tomorrow, is simple. 
Enough to incorporate the card Opencard chip and bonus previously paid only charged in it. 
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are not only in the capital but also in their vicinity. 
In other words, trains of bypass and bus from the numbers 300 by 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the villages of Bohemia central. 
"In the free trains the integrated transport of Prague is Auditors equipped with a reading card which will help to confirm the validity of the time and the area of the bond", explained the control of the notes, Drápal Filip of the Ropid organisation that provides hours of public transport in Prague. 
Buses bypass have their card readers flimsy, behind the counter of the driver. 
The move is necessary not only show the card to the driver but it is also necessary down with the Opencard in place for this in the side of the Box. 
With that, the driver controls the validity of the bond. 
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds we must ask the driver this information," completed Drápal. 
Passengers not to travel on buses bypass and not remember when they end the validity of the bond can go to the vending machines where cards we can. 
Here, the screen of the machine, it will show you the information on the validity of the document. 
The Southeastern wanted to be part of the US in a referendum 
The Sudeten Germans asked in 1945 that Fumaba already been part of the United States. 
That is what is extracted from the letter which is locked in the collection of the Science Library of Bohemia of the South. 
If we cannot be part of Germany and Austria, want at least live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this message went out, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans the chairman of the US in 1945. 
It is of the letters that are lying in a particular file and that today are sitting in the collection of the Science Library of Bohemia of the South. 
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask for in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of Munich - again to Czechoslovakia. 
"Have correctly understood the situation and we are keen to its word that American units are coming to land German as oppressors nor enemies but as liberators" writes in the letter, signed with a "people who leads the fate of Šumava in his heart". 
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Germans south-east presumably means - according to the national character the Czech - a only hope in the brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors are begging in the letter to the American president take for now and forever to Šumava under a protectorate. 
"Cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million give us to a foreign state which oppresses and rejects minorities and that nothing is working with the victory of the allies", it says in the letter. 
The reason the authors cannot sign presumably is the fear of reprisals "Czechs oppressors". 
If the chairman of presumably US doubtful about this idea of šumavos Germans, all arranged in the šumavas land a referendum on whether people want to be part of USA or live under its patronage. 
Despite that the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have today of the post-war history, may sound a little child, according to some experts he depicts the expectations of the Germans south-east of then. 
Although the Czechs Germans lacked any sense of that was to discuss its expulsion of the republic only few admit this possibility. 
Some expected the United States and Britain negotiated for Sudeten any clear of autonomy. 
Others believed that will be in Czechoslovakia. 
Even confirms the journalist Austrian Gustav Chalupa, born in Budějovice České. 
This was in the war, as German Budějovice, enrolado in the Baltic. 
When at the end of the war apresaron the British and emplazaron in the field of prisoners would tens of Germans were to him and that they were taught Czech. 
"Them believed that back home, the Czech them would do well," said Chalupa. 
None of the German prisoners before they saw the war in Czechoslovakia, he says, was that the Bene? Decrees would be removed from the Republic. 
Do not you think - pay! 
Campaign emotional attacks to drivers 
The most expensive in the Czech history to safety on the roads. 
This could be the emotional Campaign that decided to launch on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport in the media. 
The office of the minister, Aleš Řebíček promises that will deter drivers of dangerous behavior behind the wheel. 
The campaign of 150 million will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures. 
Should deter the driver of the high-speed and alcohol at the wheel. 
And also to remind you that before starting strap belts. 
To reach the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and least of professional drivers. 
And what we can see in the ads? 
Fundamentally human stories that embisten to emotions. 
And to bear witness to the announcements "bloody" throughout the campaign. 
Do not you think - pay! 
The word "Don't you think" is written with big letters at the plate. 
And in a puddle of blood is the word "pay". 
This should symbolise the man at a time of error can pay with their own lives. 
The advertisements will "frighten" to viewers by the year 2010. 
The ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon land where can see strong images of victims of accidents. 
Promises that reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czech. 
The announcements made by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for drivers 
"For drivers is the system of sugar and stick. 
Sugar is for him when, for example, is a red light and saves time. 
The whip is threat of fine or accident. 
Drivers must remember the risks, "says the psychologist of transport of Na Homolce hospital, Kořán Martin. 
And this is why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity, the psychologist. 
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers. 
"If there is some panel installed warning of some probably soon danger will be merged with the environment and the driver does not pay more attention," warned Kořán. 
Olmert almost back all the occupied territories for peace 
The chairman of the interim government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, came out on the restitution of virtually all land occupied in the 1967, i.e., the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
Proposed the interview Monday in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"Must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that necessarily have almost restore all the land (occupied) if not all," said Olmert to daily. 
"I am sure we will be stuck with a percentage of these lands, but the Palestinians have about a percent thought (the land of Israel) because without that there will be no peace," he added. 
Admitted that in case of restitution would also include Jerusalem this. 
"Those who wish to security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want that tractors or bulldozers move above his legs as he became one of my best friends, then it must hand over part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in reference to the two attacks of July in the city in which there were several deaths and dozens of people were injured. 
The president will need to find "a special solution for the Mount, a sacred and historic site" which is in the interior of the old city. 
"Those who wish to maintain the Israeli throughout the city will have to integrate to 270 Arab. 
This will not work, "more insisted. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert is also believed by Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights which from their point of view is an inherent condition to conclude a peace agreement with Syria. 
But this also would involve concrete efforts by Damascus. 
"I am not suggesting closing the peace with Syria on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," warned. 
"The Syrians know well what will have to overcome to win the Golan. 
Should abandon its current relations with Iran, should abandon its relations with the Hezbollah (movement sly -), are expected to emerge of lifelong support that terrorism of Hamas (movement, quietly), of Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq ", made the first minister. 
After questions of accident: Are illegal air stewardesses in buses? 
The law is unknown, cannot walk in a bus long-distance 
In connection with the tragic accident to the bus company Student Agency along near the Italian city of Padova us the question of whether the hostesses and passengers can move by the bus during the journey. 
"If we are more strict and formally comply with the law, the activity of the hostess is opposed to the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident that killed last week, the hostess of 22 years, obviously was caused by the driver of the lorry only that the bus sat in the road. 
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe vehicle despite having reserved two other sites. 
However, the bus may be an accident or suddenly stop, and at the very moment that the azafato distributes the coffee or newspapers. 
Here what the role is if the bus is, according to the technical permission, places to start. 
If the bus is not harmonized, the passenger should be granted. 
Buses long distances of Student Agency would not have places to go on foot, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz. 
"That have settled with the ministry and in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed. 
Finally this withdrew and we agreed that passengers can go to the toilet, the bus in place if we have seat ", said its position. 
The flight attendant does not know the law 
"There is no legal obvious interpretation of the role of the hostess - no legal provision clarifies this role. 
Not even a legal provision prohibits players of transport getting some service. 
The law of road transport only knows the term of Revisor of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined, "adds, less strongly, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the department of Traffic in road vehicle of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law enough addresses this problem. 
"Depends on whether the bus has the approval permitted to sites of ordinary. 
That is all, "he says. 
Buses are divided between the city, where there are places to be in and speed limited, intercity with sites to be with a greater permission speed and long distances without sites for ordinary, with the greatest permission speed and equipped seats with belt. 
As in the plane, says the expert 
The expert BESIP in Security in transport, Hořín Jaroslav, sees no major problems on the movement of azafato in the bus. 
"During the development of the trip not many threat of danger, the situation is comparable with the service in the aircraft. 
Even here is the safety of the turbulence and that the hostess can be hit in the head. " 
", however, if the bus suddenly stops obviously that are good physical laws. 
The same as on an urban bus or a tram. 
The safety of the hostess must deal with the regulations of the carrier, "says and also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is solved. 
Jančura is prepared to overrule this service 
Student Agency along is the only carrier that offers the service of stewardesses. 
Used in it to two. 
The director, and after the accident, believes that work out. 
"However, at the moment that is the impression that the hostess is risky, then what will. 
The coffee and the newspapers can receive, passengers, to enter. 
Even save costs, "he says. 
In interest to security is the reason why Asiana lacks air stewardesses in their vehicles, according Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared with SA. 
"Stewardesses have, we are against them from the outset. 
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident, "said less than a year ago to Týden.cz. 
Did an enormous tragedy 
In the accident in the line between Naples died a young hostess of Pilsen that had worked for the company two years. 
A Slovenian lorry that probably was from the lane parking blocking the transition to the autobús. without using the intermittent. 
His driver was in a rapid manoeuvre, however, came up with the right front. 
Jančura denies that were sold the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the flight attendant. 
"These sites is not possible wanted to travel long distances, are trapped." 
The company intends to sue the driver of the lorry. 
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation for the family of the girl but expects the financial burden on the part of the blame. 
Does reform of the law? 
No, by now 
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the hostess in the bus in which a year ago that are working 30 experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport. 
", however, have not reached any conclusion. 
Not too much to buses, but rather the points system, maximum speed on motorway and the use of mobile during the march, "says the Hořín expert. 
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses something that threatens significantly the safety of passengers", the spokesman Hanzelka, the control of security in buses is of the police and the Security Office at work. 
The hope 4-hour is supported in Frankfurt 
In the letter of the committee of the bank West LB for their staff are not big words. 
By the merger of the units of the 4-hour with the bank DEKA can be formed a central market capital of financial group of Sparkassen ', as the letter, published on Monday 
The bank West LB, breaking the 'bloco of competition "sustainable capacity of profits would come in this business. 
Moreover, such a merger could be a start for following mergers in the field of regional banks. 
So really understand the text, when a board wants to show capacity to act in hard times. 
Because just as before the West LB is under enormous pressure. 
Not only the part of the European Union, but also from federal institute of the monitoring of financial services that recently has clear the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that left little time to find a solution. 
Since some time ago, also from the part of Frankfurt, there is much talk about the union such between the bank DEKA, that customers Sparkasse know by its investment funds, and the West LB. 
Truth to tell, Franz Waas, the head of the bank DEKA, presenting the data after a year at the end of August left knowing that sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located in the street Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB. 
But the Board of Directors of the DEKA, which is now made up of regional banks and the associations of Sparkassen, commissioned to board begin negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities. 
In this it could treat of a business in the capital market or parts of it. 
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as stated in the financial website. 
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of the bank DEKA that with its 3,000 staff is among leading businessmen in the financial Frankfurt. 
In 2003 in a moment it seemed that the bank DEKA could merge with the regional bank in Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba. 
This initiative to create a union of three parties had no results. 
Hardly the plans were made public, the government of Hesse was against the participation of the Helaba in this project. 
The other two banks also not found the same language. 
Instead the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with regional bank of Baden-Württemberg. 
But were always playing again with the idea of fusion of bank DEKA with other regional banks. 
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the committee of the Helaba, remarked that he was against the plans of the coexistence with their bank. 
Independent of that seems to be more clear that the union of the various banks of public law is necessary. 
Then, when will the elections of parliament of Bavaria, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure continue merging will increase, Helaba him will be partners for that. 
In the south the bank could be only a young partner, although until now much arose more of the financial crisis that became the property of Stuttgart and Munich. 
Of the Sparkassen - and Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB. 
In any case is only the LB Nord. 
But such geo-strategic reflections are are only a part. 
Another part is the compatibility of different banking models. 
In June Merl made a fundamental question on a business model that could guarantee the future for the regional banks, that the Deutsche Sparkassen- collectible Giro- Verband until now Commission gave no response. 
In end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the wish of the bank. 
So, in the letter of the committee of the bank said that it would try to find a comprehensive solution for the entire bank 
As you can marry the coexistence between individual parts of the bank with the DEKA, this is going to show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians" 
For Elena is the first time, to Luca already the third or fourth. 
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and therefore it looks different, says. 
Behind them, the side of a barrel of 5 litres of beer brand Kaiser is built a huge tiger bear that shows almost 200 participants of Oktoberfest that low sounds knows place in your throat. 
First Elena gives Luca a pat, after a kiss. 
Bologna came to Verona. 
From there, the parking lot to the side of the station trains Porta Nuova, tonight at 11: 45 left three buses, 'direction Munich, the celebration of beer ", predictable arrival at 6: 30 in the morning. 
Three buses are due mainly to the Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians. 
In one of the corner of parking by its flag are singing from the South American, they had already started to celebrate night. 
With much noise, says Marco Guarda, that is nothing for the Italians. 
Marco, wearing a long coat with a forro of artificial skin and glasses with patillas of colour of silver, belong these buses. 
For five years are the Oktoberfest, bearing in mind that this year alone there are three trips. 
Night on the road there, during the day in the fields, at 10.30. 
Spend the night there means only unnecessary expenditure, says Programme. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the receipt of the welcome with a beer Kaiser that was made in accordance with the law of the purity of the Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German Programme attended a course of language in Frankfurt. 
Night buses are already on the road in the motorway with the direction "Brenner" 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Soon the tranquillity reigns in the bus, passengers are asleep. 
Well, they will still need the forces. 
It is to Brixen and to Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian number plates do another break in the motorway 8 before of Munich. 
Finally, when the group of Marco has the addition to the 6.30 of morning in the parking lot next to the Prado of Teresa, where circa there are 50 other buses across Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the other meeting, Marco is his last speech on how to proceed. 
First: poneros a yellow hats. 
There, on the left side is writing "Oktoberfest", alongside in Gothic letter is the website of the office of travel Programme in the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it." 
Second: "When you open the door of the shop in the campaign, that means we go!," shouts Programme in the early hours. 
"Go!" March and the sites of back in the shop of the campaign. 
"Not you sites, because we are going to block, and all with baseball yellow not you sentéis in the same dock throughout space!" 
A pint of beer, roars Programme, costs 8.25 euros. 
Do not forget the tip 
It mostrad to the people of security that we have good tone! 
Only gets out of his seat, he already is! " 
Third: "This afternoon exactly ten and average you get here!" Do you understand? 
And now everyone has the Oktoberfest. 
One, to lead the way, ties the yellow hats in the trees, traffic signs and even in a poster of the election of a People ’ s Party of Bavaria. 
It wants to see the way back. 
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians" 
There are no precise data on the number of people, about 50,000 people who make the trip to the Alps and tormentosamente come under the tents, 10 percent of all came this weekend of Italy. 
The police in Munich receives help from seven policemen in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers to help the Red Cross from Bavaria that makes a statistic of the nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (nearly 60 being here) and the Austrian in the first place. 
The favourite shop in the campaign of the Italians is so-called Hofbräuzelt. 
The nights without sleep to the creditors of Royal Hypo Estate 
The banking system of Germany is relatively stable, heightened only last week the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück. 
Well, that the political uses the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected for critical trends. 
And that has occurred since the end of the week. 
Royal hypo Estate (HRE), the financial of property in Munich, which is priced in the DAX, is of a consortium of German banks a credit of billion to make resistance to the turbulence in the market. 
On Monday a person who is very familiar with the situation told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euro. 
Part of the capital that the Royal Hypo Estate will use must shed interest. 
The money comes as banks also deprived of the public. 
The cause of that are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa. 
According to a report, the state financing with the money that was given to the long-term projects financed only a brief period that now, because of distrust in the markets, no more is possible. 
In the first half of the year the capital reserve bank's cash has fall in a 95 percent, 2.37 million euro, also the quota of capital held back a little bit of a 1.6 percent to a 1.45 per cent. 
Compared with the same period last year the continuing income of financial investments and net profits of financial operations fell to zero, the income of charging for debtors and some securities values the dissolution of provisions of the credit business have tended to fall more than 70 percent, by 5 million euro. 
Only thanks to high and many income of reimbursement for the cost of compensation of the restructuring of ex-grupo as well Depfa as the payment of interest on the federal code of taxes and business organised for businesses in the consortium, the negative balance might accuse a deficit with some 16 percent more. 
After its privatisation in 1990 the financial state former was initially lost on speculation with industrial loans for the buildings, which may have reason to foundation of Aareal bank. 
As it could not win much money with the funding for state projects, the Defa began to find work on projects in the field of infrastructure and funding for the EU projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversificó. 
Now the Royal Hypo Estate has to make repayments on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the account consolidated gains and losses of group, says very imprecisely. 
It is a fact that have cancelled the dividends. 
As for the year 2007 they were cancelled two thirds. 
After the acquisition by Depfa the Royal Hypo Estate became a major financial state and financial in the field of infrastructure. 
As the bank has no deposits customer, he, compared with other banks, it is more dependent on the refinancing in the interbank market. 
With the collapse of US investment Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans essentially fell because banks were saving its liquidity. 
Each year the Royal Hypo Estate almost needed 50 billion to finance part of portfolios of credit Defa of their short-term measures to the refinancing. 
According to the report by the Royal Hypo Estate, the bank covers with a loan the need for funding the group for a brief time and the company is "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially are not suitable for work" 
Other sources say that this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009. 
Funke Georg, the chairman of the committee of the Royal Hypo Estate, explained that the Royal Hypo Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable future. 
The German central bank and the federal institute of the monitoring of financial services (BaFin) are based on the notion that the competitiveness of the Royal Hypo Estate Group from now on. 
That they have to expect shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But because of the dynamic of the imponderables the crisis there. 
It is even possible that did not need funding in its full volume. 
But we cannot rule out the case. 
Was the voice of that in the last hour of Sunday, the bank still largely was in bankruptcy, so the temporary salvation nor can reassure at least people concerned. 
The price of action fell 75 percent, 3.30 euros. 
The courses of loan, on the other hand, are really well. 
While the priority debts almost no change, courses of borrowing under the position in the registration of the property clearly tend downwards. 
Affected are especially loans of the former subsidiary Hypo drink Württemberg and with the reason the loans whose maturity beyond 2009. 
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition by Depfa that affected the Royal Hypo Estate, the current value of its borrowings that used to be an investment in speculation are becoming dependent on the stability of the international financial system. 
While the central banks, governments and banks are still affected are ready to support the system, while both can be from the repayment of pension. 
Or going to happen, what risks imagine - the financial crisis will be resolved in the next 15 months. 
But watching the news back on the partial estatización, now the security that is now in its limit became a justified hope. 
This is going to be a reason, because creditors will nights without sleep, breaking the head on the decision on its isolation of enthusiasm. 
Yet investors in the short term can the end point and use the transport to new account of the losses to next payments of compensation benefits on the change in the future. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent? -box 
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, 16-year-old girl, had to stand in the Highschool of Tachibana the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges her account Japan. 
"The first day at a school in Japan. 
I was nervous. 
Even before going to college I was afraid. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction Kawasaki and I will train 40 minutes at the Highschool Tachibana. 
One had to find our way, fortunately not I missed. 
It seems that the start of the classes is not so set strict as in my home, in Lower Saxony. 
Of the eight of the morning come the pupils, the nine less 20 starts a small meeting with teachers, the 'home extend'. 
Before she began the class, I had to stand. 
Furthermore I am not a person who speaks with the public, particularly to a class of 40 pupils. 
As they still have the school uniform I started an old skirts of the mother of my family host and a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes of. 
Therefore, lady I started the pulpit and tried to make all in one way: "Sayonara she Wo Sylvana..." - I call Sylvana, come from Germany, and in a week is my birthday. 
At this time I was very happy because for two years had begun to examine this language. 
All 31 girls in the classes have cuchicheado, laughed and signalling and all the time I heard the word "kawaii" 
Already the knew of my Mangas. 
This is part of the vocabulary of survival of Japanese girls and means "mona, abuts" 
After I quickly deslicé in my room. 
The girl next door had a big smile, for it was an honour that the 16-year-old exchange had to sit next to it. 
The rest of the class was fairly calm, but when rang the gong, I was really transmitter. 
Everybody was talking at the same time, reían and raised many questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
After the craft all took their Bentos. 
The mother of my family host also was a Lanchbox for my - is something else that boring bits of German bread. 
Had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and something as meat in mass of tofu. 
In most cases I have no idea what as here in Japan. 
Things are rare and have a new flavor. 
What is certain is that it is all very rich. 
Therefore, perhaps with the exception of marinadas plums in the salt, bufff! 
In Japanese schools the bentos are not simply a lunch. 
Sometimes is that a girl prepares a bento done in very artistic for a boy and given away in hope of being able to know better during a craft. 
On that I read in my Manga-Comics. 
I am very curious to see if I can also see it here. 
"Why exactly Japan?", I asked my friends when I told them that he wanted to go to Tokyo for a year the school. 
Then always responded. 
"Good, because I am fascinated." 
Finally for years I read Mangas. 
To better understand the comics and culture, one day I started to look a little Language. 
I was absolutely sure that one day I will go there. 
Because I have a weakness for tradition and customs. 
Here they have a great value. 
One part of the Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, also is a strong country, disciplined and traditional. 
As is well organised, yet I felt here lost although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen in my life. " 
Also the rats have feelings 
It says that a rat or a cucaracha feeling the danger fleeing, why has also fear? 
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings. 
How can control whether they, behaving in this way, we feel the same? 
In a magazine of Internet so-called "Edge" in many years are published the contributions of famous scientists. 
Spiegel ONLINE filed in a series the answers elected to the question, What will you what is true without being able to prove it? 
I believe that animals are sensations and other states of consciousness without that I, or someone else could prove so far, but we cannot even prove that other people have a conscience. 
But in this case, at least we can expect because all human brains present the same fundamental shape. 
But as soon as we devote to other species and include questions about the feeling and in general the conscience, entering the unknown because the hardware is not. 
When a rat is in danger, the same as the other animals, the dead, fleeing or attacks. 
People behave in this way, some scientists make conclusions on comparable subjective experience. 
Of course I think not. 
Two aspects of the brain structure are difficult to infect our subjective experience to the animal. 
First, almost always them include circuits associated by human consciousness of prefrontal lateral lobe activate the cerebral cortex (due to their participation in the short memory and in executive positions at conduct). 
This large segment is much more developed in the case of people than the other primates and seems totally lacking in other creatures. 
Taking into account the issues relating to our conscience that depends on the prefrontal lobe activate the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to believe that the man is different from the other primates. 
A another matter is in the nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that the conscience depends on it. 
In this case cannot be excluded the animals. 
But even as the conscience of the language, the impact of the conscience of the animals, whatever created, in many cases would differ from the majority of our conscience. 
So it is difficult to explain how an awareness of other animals. 
If, as something interesting and subjective, nor is measure because it has the special hardware, and is considered by our experiences, their research has significant problems. 
Most of my speeches about the content of the experience allows, but at the same time there is another aspect of the awareness that there should be more easy to research scientists. 
Could investigate the processes of conscience of animals without taking into account their content, and that is what happens during the studies of short memory of primates, especially in the example of the display. 
But with this approach that still Christof Koch and Francis Crick what vital more passes to the correlatos neutral of conscience that the causal mechanisms: The two can be such or not. 
Interestingly this approach emphasises the importance of the prefrontal lobe activate the cerebral cortex for the training of the display. 
And what is that for the sensations? 
I think the fact that in the emotional system is a part of the brain that is responsible for this, what is happening with fear. 
What are described as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain is an area of defence system (or their consequences such as the reactions of the body). 
Seen from this point of view the sensations are set to part of the brain cortex that distinguishes primates and above all the man. 
In terms of linguistic nature are rankings of fine feeling because we can distinguish and classify the states with the aid of words and grammar to describe the other couple of ourselves. 
For example Damascus Antonio, on the contrary, the sensations arise from the simple activities of the parts of the brain responsible cortex by personal feelings and stump of brain, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on core brain. 
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, can look at different types and their sensations. 
For reasons teoréticas I cannot go against that, but what I think is not likely. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that sits in two cases: But how can control if rats and men behaving similarly feel the same? 
Seeing the danger a cucaracha fleeing, because he is afraid? 
I am of the opinion of the similarity of behaviour still not test the similarity of experience. 
It is true that the comparison neural aid: rats and men have syllabuses of similar brain, the cucarachas on the contrary they have at least a brain. 
Is it the stump of brain which is responsible for feelings? 
Even when possible test for men: How can you prove it in case of rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, also possibly the cucarachas (who knows?), have feelings. 
But do not know how I can prove it. 
I prefer to investigate emotional behaviour of rats that emotional feelings because their sensations supposedly is fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness relates to special circuits and language). 
In any case here expect progress in the field of neurology as judge of rats and men. 
As not investigo the language and the conscience of rats, as well as feelings, I do not know if they exist.

From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half fell to 23.6%. 
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even reduced by half.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of the probes spatial 
For many years a phenomenon mysteries cause confusion to researchers: the Oscura Matters influences the speed of the space probes during so-called gravity assistance to the manoeuvre. 
Experts fear that the Theory of the Relatividad of Albert Einstein cannot be correct. 
The space probe "Ulysses" took almost 18 years flying in the universe. 
Because of that the pipes of fuel are now helándose threatened a penalty in the cold. 
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravity assistance to the manoeuvre, causing confusion among researchers. 
The gravity assistance is a manoeuvre of the history of the space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of gravity field of a planet, for example. 
This allows space probes to save fuel. 
Cassini-huygens, the probe space EU-USA cyanide this physical trick as well as the probe of the Sun Ulysses. 
But what surprised researchers for many years: The missiles are no 100 percent and is expected as the venerable law of the gravitación. 
More frequent irregularities of speed. 
Suddenly the probes has more or less speed. 
Physicists could not explain this effect so far. 
They called the anomaly during the gravity assistance to the manoeuvre. 
Some experts fear that possibly even the General Theory of the Relatividad of Albert Einstein that describes the appeal of the field by the curvature of the space might not be correct. 
Stephen Adler, the US physicist of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton solemnly believes now and before that Einstein's not confused and tries to explain the anomaly during the gravity assistance with so-called Oscura Matters, in what were astronomers in the universe. 
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Oscura matters which can also be very close to the Earth," he writes. 
Researchers of the universe are aware of the Oscura only Matters for ten years. 
Supposedly she possesses the attraction and its influence can be seen in other planets. 
The Oscura Matters, on the contrary, it is completely invisible that means that it sends and no indication of any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light. 
According to estimates from scientists Oscura Matters makes at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.

An official with the loss of data 
The BBC was informed that an official in the Cabinet who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the law on the official secrets. 
The man, in travel to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two documents highly classified in the train to Waterloo. 
The documents were past to the BBC before being handed over to the police. 
It is perhaps the least serious charge under the law and is not an indication of the intention of committing crimes. 
The BBC correspondent for the Defence Frank Gardner pointed out that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the British administration. 
"Thought that there were an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said. 
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Law, the clause to safeguard the information. 
The Juríco Real Service said that the officer must be accused by the Metropolitana Police, because of the highly sensitive nature of their work in the Secret Services.

The building facing the price of B 
In Britain the societies of construction could face a price of more than 80 billion pounds after rescue / rescue of Bradford and Bingley. 
The government, in effect, provided 14 trillion pounds to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of bank. 
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money from savers, including 59 societies of construction. 
The director of the Association of Societies of Construction (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that the company and its members have to pay 
Eventually, the loan de14 trillion should be after reimbursed mortgages of Bradford and Bingley are redimidas. 
However, the interest that has become in the meantime, there are loads each year to the 700 financial companies which take deposits. 
The Plan for Compensation for Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 societies of construction are included in that number. 
It is humiliating that the institutions that acted prudently... are calls to pay the price of the institutions that have been far less cautious. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
Is that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that the mediation had to pay something the 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan to 450 billion pounds in 2009. 
That means that companies will have to recover 81 billion pounds for the first year of interest. 
Adrian Coles, director of the Business Association of Societies of Construction, told the BBC that this situation is unfair. 
"Humiliating that the institutions that acted with restraint in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price for those that much less prudent." 
According to the BSA, there is no data that shows the failure of any society since 1945. 
"Have the need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to see what options exist to protect the company and its members in response to what could be a significant price," added Mr Cole. 
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March. 
In 2010, there will be a full year of interests required, which can be almost twice more. 
The company building mutual organisations and has shareholders, its members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.

New research in the uptake of lawyers for ransom 
The Attorney-General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006. 
The reason was a report in which the general inspector of the Department of Justice criticised the action by administration officials. 
The report was critical of the officials from the White House, the legislators and the former Produrador General Alberto Gonzales. 
The research was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been cleared for political reasons. 
The Special Prosecutor Dannehy Nora is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in the attempt to block the justice. 
"Serious complaints of possible behaviour criminals have not been fully investigated and resolved," the Attorney-General Glenn Bellas stated in the report. 
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to make their statements. 
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were cleared of charges by the Justice Department in December 2006. 
At the time, the department brought about the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed for. 
But later it became known that the lawyers had not been assessed worse than others, and many observers led to the conclusion that the despidas would be motivated by political reasons. 
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the prosecution of a few Republicans, members of high profile of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats. 
These lawyers investigated and judged the legal cases to the government 
And can be fired at any time, but then cleared up for political reasons. 
The future head of the Department of Justice, the Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the redundancies, resigned from his position. 
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same. 
The report by the Attorney-General is highly critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and stressed as he had a "primary responsibility" for the redundancies, "might" their position of leadership and was "significantly not collaborative" in the process. 
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former aide of Bush, were criticised for not cooperated with the investigation. 
The epic of Meat Loaf of great pride 
The rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honoured in the Q Awards for his anthem epical Yeor Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who won the special award next week at the ceremony which will take place in London, said that the recognition will be "an honour". 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and 50 seconds, was the title of the album with that Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977. 
The group of Coldplay are leading the nominations for the awards this year and doing the classification of the four categories. 
Paul Rees, redactor-jefe of the magazine Q, said: "There are certain songs that transcend time and gender, and Yeor Out Of Hell is certainly one of them." 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires a voice excellent ability the kind that was used by Meat Loaf. 
Instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem. 
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and fell to number 15 in the classification. 
However, Yeor Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained nine years in the rankings and went on to sell more than 40 million copies around the world. 
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - have suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, a sharp laringitis forced him to cancel several concerts. 
It later emerged that he had a quiste in his voice. 
Dark streets of the city, often forgotten and early to the sale 
The city of New York has thousands of flood, boulevards, streets and other paths, some famous, others simply of service. 
However, many people, inclusas the veterans taxi and local residents of long-term, it is difficult to find out the location of the Extra ’ Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street. 
The small street is in the East Village and extends to the north of the Primiera Calle - before that was the Seconda Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue. 
This little street, more or less than 30 feet wide and 120 of long into a dusty alleyway more of an active way. 
There are no signs. 
It is almost impossible to find on a map. 
The street, however, has admirers. 
For example, Montego Bay Avalon, the company that has recently built buildings of luxury in the Primiera Calle 
Who wants to repavimentar Extra ’ Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include the neighbours of old dates that they be delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last vestiges of the past of block before the acceptance of the buildings. 
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in poseerla. 
In the course of a meeting of the Community of Vencidad for the use of the land that took place this month, representatives of the agency Avalon Nepad a proposal to buy the street. 
However, the committee, preferring the street remained in the city, called for a new plan that will be presented next month, as Stetzer Susan, the manager of district of the Community n.3. 
"The city owns today of very few spaces and we would like to follow owns Extra ’ Place," he said. 
"Consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the area, but also want to ensure public access to the street." 
Bay avalon had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small streets and installing a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hopes of renting space. 
The idea that Avalon could buy the street appeared for the first time during the meeting this month 
But Michele of Milly, a spokesman for Montego Bay Avalon, said that despite that the company wanted to use the street, not necessarily wanted poseerla. 
"The primary concern of Montego Bay Avalon is the renewal of the blind abandoned and the possibility of making it in a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for the Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire by the city to sell the street and noted that the agency ’ s mission is the development of the property more that the management of that. 
In comparison with its surroundings of colour, the Bowery, Extra ’ Place has left a mark in history. 
Some believe his name in 1802, when the great holding of ownership of Philip Minthorne was divided between their children and this narrow strip of land was not requested by anyone. 
The back door of the CBGB, the monument of punk rock which closed in 2006, abriba in Extra ’ Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that the deck of the album of Ramones "Stephenson Russia". 
"The beautiful environment," said Danny Fields, the PR man of the Ramones, that took the photograph in November 1976. 
"Was full of junk, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, cords." 
Some residents, including bloggers who write on the aburguesamiento of East Village resisted the idea of selling Extra ’ Place, arguing that public goods, still modest, must remain public. 
Others have praised Extra ’ Place as rare piece, virtually unchanged, a raja of the city that should be managed. 
Jeremiahs Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitulo, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at City in the process of Going Extinct"), has been part of a talk in the history of the city on Extra ’ Place, published by the daily newspaper The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra ’ Place is a blind a little tight and alley, dark also for the day and marked by doors of warehouse of corroded and contra-ventanas iron, with old newspapers of weeks soplados over the canalones." 
With few exceptions, the streets seemed more or less the same on a recent afternoon. 
A rat is curía through the part of the street and near standstill the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now welcomes a clothing shop of luxury. 
Graffitti on walls and a bottle of empty beer closely 22-oz were close a new batch of discarded newspapers. 
Some interns said that rarely brought attention in Extra ’ Place, but suggested that it could give him a cleansed. 
Mr Fields, for its part, noted that some people underestimates the attractive power of the street in its current state. 
"I spent the best years of my life," said, "in dark places, humid and disgusting." 
The debate over bilingualism: immersion in the language Corte 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi predilections the positions of the candidates on the bilingual education. 
Launched T. Izumi, an old associated in studies on the California and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-autor the book Not Ace 'Good as You Think: Bowen the Middle Class School Choice Needs. " 
Draw effectively to Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals in education made by Barack Obama are the example of that. 
The campaign of Mr Obama notes that "the afro-americanos and students Latins significantly have less chance of graded the white students," and this is a very some consideration. 
To combat such differences in the events of learning, the plan education of specifically Obama argues, among other things, "the bilingual education for transition" for the alumnos-Inglés. 
However, the open question for Mr Obama is if the commitment of the bilingual education, which prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in the distance in the final results. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street preparatory, a primary school officially recognised in the eastern region of the county of Los Angeles. 
At this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of them newcomers, are learning the English language. 
However, an incredible 100 percent of the students the fourth year, it has been positively assessed in the study of mathematics of 2008 
And almost equally astonishing 93 per cent has dominated the test of English language and gear. 
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that favorido by Mr Obama. 
The school Sixth Street emphasises the review and practice, the constant evaluation of the powers and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses. 
Also, and this is where Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the sixth Calle, the approach of the school for the training of English students is in the "total immersion". 
Immersion in Corte means the nearly exclusive use of language in the treatment of the contents of the investigation. 
Mrs Mikels, which opposes the bilingual education, said, "we had extraordinary successes with students as this has come from EC-Mexico and that, if -- in the classroom 12 months later not serías capable of picking up what was." 
"Works," said, "we believe that work." 
Take Mr Obama a school as Sixth Street preparatory as a model of replicated by other schools with large populations of hispanos-inglés pupils? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of politicians of his party on the issue of education (Partnerships for National Education have been long defenders of bilingual education) and his support for education dark bilingual the prediction of the response from Mr Obama. 
Although that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr Obama has dismissed the issue that people should stop worrying about the legislation that only written in Corte 
And instead of that, he said, "you have to make sure your child can speak Spanish." 
If Mr Obama wants to improve the system and close loopholes, should carefully consider the models of education which work, more that hold them in contempt or stripping them. 
The price of oil fell falls after the revived economic fears 
The price of oil has been drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern of the American bailout plan for the financial markets may not be able to revive the economy. 
The actions of crude oil fell 7 percent to 99,80 dollars a barrel in the negotiation of the morning in the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The price has fallen more than $20 per barrel since last Monday. 
In the past two weeks, the commodities markets have been buffeted by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of EC-Mexico. 
After reaching a maximum of 145,29 dollars per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 a barrel at the start of this month, before back, once again, because of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets. 
The anxiety gripped investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history. 
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis, far from complete.

As the economic situation deteriorates, is expected in a lower demand for commodities, including oil. 
"The prospects for the global equity, the rate of interest and change will be increasingly uncertain," wrote analysts from the Deutsche Bank in a note to investors. 
"We believe that the basic products will not be able to escape this infection. 
From the perspective of the products, our most pressing concern is the assessment if the American virus will spread worldwide, and specifically China. " 
Analysts of bank have reduced their expectations for the next year, as the consumption of oil because of the crisis on economic growth and a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 per cent for 2009. 
Second quarter of madness: team sets record 
After spending over the last eight seasons, longer than anyone else in the uniform of Jets, playing in defence, Shaun Ellis I thought I had seen it all. 
Then he saw as things develop in the second quarter Sunday, when the Jets transformed a party without note in a game back down. 
"I have never seen anything like this," said Ellis. 
The second quarter after launching of the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness under dismal of the clouds. 
At this time was that the quarterback Brett Favre found to Laveranues Coles making a target of 12 yardas and suggesting the perfect harbinger for a late, in that the evolution of the relationship between the players took a huge leap forward. 
Favre found to Coles for two goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fallen down and another came with 10 seconds left in the half. 
"I left my way," Favre said of all the steps that were going to Coles. 
"He is a hell of a player. 
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think. " 
While Favre and Coles were performed in the dam, the defence of the Cardinals maltrataba to the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis New York Times a andante marksmanship and returned 32 yardas for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith puntó to another happens and what New York Times. 
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to lack for Warner. 
In the last turnover, spotted forced by Bowens, could have been the best. 
The Cardenals had taken possession with 10 available seconds, and after that the Jets reinstituted the ball, Jay Feely gave him a kick from 20 yardas to earn a final 34-0. 
Are the main points that the Jets never did in a quarter. 
To the coach of the team, Eric Mangini, preguntadle to describe the madness of the moment, said: "The second quarter or the third quarter?" 
When told both - the Jets allowed 21 points without reply in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I am very happy over the second quarter that the terzero. 
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time. " 
Gebrselassie equipped to be heads his record global 
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown because many he is considered the largest corridor of history, beating his own world record in the marathon in Berlin this Sunday and deviniendo the first person to run the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in the acomodadiza career in plain in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie has shattered by 27 seconds its previous record of 2: 04: 26, obtained last year in Berlin. 
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the record world number 26 in a career of an impressive length so has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the race against time to the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming way, in hindsight, that air pollution agravaran their problems with asthma. 
Instead, he running in Berlin. 
In nearly perfect conditions - sunny with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Domingo, using in average around will blow 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile. 
Since when corridors of runway as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have been turned long distances, the record of marathon has fallen by over two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05 in 1998. 
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered fits in the pantorrilla two weeks before and that he had lost a week of training. 
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not corroded. 
"I am very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I started again a week ago, and today teñí some doubts, but in the end it all was well. " 
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the afro-oriental rival of Ethiopia - for the style of music careers, in general, avoiding the meeting with many stars of world marathon, based on the pacemaker as if it were a career, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not lessen the greatness of the skills of Gebrselassie as corridor. 
This Sunday, the progress of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race in 1: 02: 04. 
Two corridors of elite of Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their pacemakers fell. 
But shortly before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie dragged her up one last drive to secede from Kwambai, who was second in 2: 05: 36, improving its best personal record for almost five minutes. 
Kamathi came to third in 2: 07: 48. 
In the women ’ s race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2: 19: 19, the seventh fastest time in history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko, of 36 years, was a surprise and won the Marathon in London in 2: 24: 14. 
She also took part in the Beijing Games for what was described as an injury in the back, but recovered to win in Berlin and set his personal best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon that flowed. 
Made a career of intelligent calculation, leaving a quartet of Kenyans and Ethiopians do and then, after recuperándoles of 18 ½ miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place in 2: 21.31, while Kiprop Elena of Kenya was third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a city apart, pride and the evidence of the lives of colour 
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the Orlando, a few kilometres from the brilliant, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and the complications of the experience African-American is are obvious. 
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by black incorporated in the country and all of the children of Zora Neale Hurston, already is not as simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three camps croquet, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison." 
Now it is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Dee Ruby have come to the annual Zora! Free-for-all involving Eatonville for pay tribute to the Hurston, the most famous writer of Renaissance of Harlem. 
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - making it a tourist stage through its inclusion in the direction of travel of Florida for Project of the evidence Federal of the season the depression - remains a place apart. 
The city is independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs Hurston wrote that black rural in the Florida often resistiva to share their real ideas with the white man, that "know as little about us and who do not know what is. ' 
Even now, in the year that a presidential black candidate, Senator Barack Obama, drew attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in the face of the stranger. 
"We are very cautious about the way in which our history," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident and member of the oldest church in the city. 
"Must be right." 
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and fight. 
It is at the same time a historic model of affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 400 people living under a level of double poverty of the national average. 
Is a literary center, but also an example repaired the rural culture of black South - to loose times, other praised - that was born of slavery in America. 
It is not surprising, if the resident here are the proud and reserved. 
To Y caring about the image of Eatonville actually began by Zora, as anyone here will Mrs draws Hurston. 
It introduced his hometown the world through their profound books in dialect as "Mules and Tiananmen" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the direction of the Florida transformed the city, just outside the map 17, a road that runs through the centre of the Florida often forgotten inward the history of the black and the human tragedy. 
Taking side of cement in life as in the literature, Mrs Hurston led to their readers to the shop owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and after home areas private. 
"Outside of the road at left hand," he wrote, "the modern school public marón with its finished, its well kept jardinos and backyards, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can read and write." 
It also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anyone else is going with transitional rooms." 
Therefore, in just a few hundreds of words, Mrs Hurston puts on Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
Obviously, this Fodor not what I was doing. 
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait. 
"Zora described him as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs Hurston immortalised by quoting to men who were singing songs without colour on their beauty. 
He added: "Some people not you liked that." 
Mrs Hurston is even mentioned here as a vivacious excéntrica that returned often after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida. 
Augusto Franklin, 77 years, recalls that when Mrs Hurston came at city it without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that still prides of dress with dignity. 
The majority of the residents were fascinated, said Mr Franklin, while many snidely reían. 
"People always much: to see Zora," continues Mr. Franklin. 
But, she adds, balanceándose in his wheelchair in a back yard with a view on the Sabelia Loch, where Mrs Hurston probably was baptised, "it never too remained time." 
When Mrs Hurston died in 1960, was poor and its books were no longer in estampación. 
As most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of colour in the Barnard College in the 20s, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had been living. 
In Eatonville, there was no large ceremonial crowns, or large public readings. 
"I do not believe that your contribution to the world or its heritage were seen," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in rebus Rainbows," a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003. 
A turning point came in the 1980s. 
Officials in Orange wanted to put a road of five lanes through the town, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the streets of two main lanes of the community. 
The expansion of the area of Orlando already had pushed the Interstate 4 through the western edge of town. 
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville been was recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
The forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 50, the struggle for racial mix led the hatred on the community. 
"During this season, a group of white boys, were on the city by throwing oranges and each against the people who were sitting at the side," said Mr Franklin. 
"Also killed a girl, once. 
He launched against a sandía of car. " 
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs Hurston wrote in the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticising the forced integration by the Supreme Court, which, in Brown v. Board of Education "rogue instead of honour my race." 
R Los residents are saying today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some aspects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young. 
"Black children were used to be abrazados - I am reminded of this - pediatrician embrace the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community ’, a nonprofit organization. 
This lasted, he added, so that teachers and students do not member came from the same place. 
"I was not going to go back to your teacher because white éra - there is a cultural divide there," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Civil rights, however, helped to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who spent above the prejudices, just as it did, with buoyant, confidence and lines as: "How can any to deny themselves the pleasure of my company! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker was until the unmarked grave of Mrs Hurston and started fighting to resurrect his reputation. 
Five years later, a much-vaunted biography of Mrs Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroduciéndola in American royalty. 
The project of the road came at the very time that the most famous daughter of Eatonville was going again under the spotlight. 
And this time, the old neighbours of Mrs Hurston seen it as a savior. 
In 1988, the community began to plan a free-for-all for Mrs Hurston to show that the county could ruin with it. 
Thousands of admirers came to the event opening two years later, and each January, many return to the celebration. 
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposal of road. 
"The idea resurrected the road at five, would have been in what you might call speed of curvature, a genuine civic pride," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd what said simply: "Zora saved to Eatonville." 
The victory on the draft of the road has helped to change the image of the city. 
People outside town as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to revisit the past. 
Eatonville entered into the Register Swedish National in 1998. 
A new library (under the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repavimentado and fine Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: to only six miles from the centre of Orlando, can sometimes feel victimised as in a street of past under a hail of summer, in a small town like the one that was founded by only 27 black families in 1880. 
(90% of the people is black today.) 
Outsiders who come in search of the history of Eatonville, its significance, often still are treated with caution. 
To A permission beforehand needed to make the most of the interviews, and some things - like the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted with a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a courageous and stubborn teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still feared that their community island gives can be misinterpreted. 
And yet, as the Hurston festival has been extended, has also been a higher level of hometown pride. 
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs Hurston saw his race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, silly and mixed. 
It is a sincere civic pride that can be heard in the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, which is planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, which said it could need a bit of help. 
And even those who are young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twin 11 years of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"The majority of people, in case that dare go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared with any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to the church on a recent Sunday. 
"But if you do start and take a moment to look at the history, is a very nice city." 
Here, in New York, all currently about finances 
On the surface, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan are far of kiosks and the giant television screens in Times Square, not would realise of being in the eye of the hurricane. 
They could never imagine that behind the façade of glass of the offices to nest of bee that are above their heads, the bankers and the managers of hedge funds who monopolize New York deal every day with the worst "bad day of office" from the downturn of 1929. 
Boys for the delivery to continue undoubtedly their trolleys of metal for tea through sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for meetings breakfast. 
Men Latins still drags between apartment buildings cargodos, like human mules, with 50 shirts of excéntrica estampación colgandas to a stranglehold on their shoulders. Workers of office still waiting in a queue for food for the morning, and still is impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 afternoons in the working days. 
Employees expect todavia queuing for his bagel to the trolleys of sellers, and todavia is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in the dias of the week. 
It seemed as if there were not a crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there are, I have decided to open a new account of savings. 
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation coincided with the calm of the end of the evening in my subsidiary local of JP Morgan, let, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting. 
And not ahead of the shop employee, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of bank customer service where customers of ordering their talonarios of cheques, tourists seeking instructions to go to stores of Macy and new customers want to open their accounts. 
The majority of these people I, I was more informed late by Starr, my "personal banker of confidence," and was in the queue for the same reason that I am. 
Unlike me, still, had already withdrawn their savings of the smaller banks in places from where they had commuted, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Isle of Staten. 
Had taken their money out of the so-called associations of savings (a little like a society of construction), credit unions and banks of her native whose brancas only operate inside the state of belonging, and say that treat customers as to his family. 
During the last year, 15 of these banks quietly have failed. 
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion, went into bankruptcy, and, as New Yorkers heading towards their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with deposits of savings of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer of rescue. 
The workers of offices and shops that are covered by me, fearing another collapse, they were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street. 
Ordinary people of New York have become in recent weeks as experts of finances. 
A woman in my Chinese local supermarket, speaking by telephone, referring to Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and its executive director of distressed, Dick Fuld, said the matter with familiarity as if it quejaran of inactivity of a colleague. 
And Lyn, 50th and something conserje in uniform of my block of flats, has changed the normal course of talks on Brad and Angelina or my shopping the shopkeeper. 
He told me, after my visit to the bank, which "now all my savings in money market funds. 
The commuting is made, I am not taking some risk. " 
Graves Muslim, at the moment in which Austria is close to the right-wing 
Heinz-christian Strache, the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Belgian Dewinter, the governing party of far-right Vlaams Belang, taking part in a demonstration to present to the organisation "Cities against the Islamisation" in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008. 
Take traffic signals that represent the mosques with a red line through. 
The police are blaming some extremist far-right for having desecrated a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties of the extreme right made huge profits during the general election in the country. 
More than 90 graves severely were damaged in the graveyard of Traun, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe that was a crime. 
Criminals doused Jews symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but researchers think that may have happened for an attempt to hide the real reasons of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear whether the incident was in some way related to the elections. 
A spokesman for the Islamic local Community said that they were "deeply chocados" by the news of the desecration, who came to the religious Muslims when the month Ramadan was ending. 
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing to a round of soul-searching after the shift to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two far-right parties that almost acapararon 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a encentrada campaign in the anti-inmigración and some of its slogan were considered xenophobic by critics. 
Heinz-christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party that gained more than 18 percent of the vote, his campaign against headscarves and burkas, and expressed its opposition to the food as relating to Islam. 
In their last meeting in Vienna, spoke of a "European sisterhood" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
Both parties ententan ban the building of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the policy of Islamisation in progress in Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the right-wing political bloc stronger country, indicate that the change was mainly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.

"I understand the master outside of stage to extract its position" Günther Bauer Fotógrafo 
And high heels, or flying or costumes of debut. 
The essence of the masters of Fleming, stripped of the concentration in interpreting for the relaxed aspect of man or woman. 
The artist. 
For others, the person. 
Inseparable except in privacy, at the wrong moment, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen or the expresividad of some hands, despreocupadas because not going out to stage. 
The German Günther Bauer alternating in "Flamenco-people" the teatralidad of some on stage with singers, dancers and guitarristas with that side less known of these teachers. 
With this proposal, the photographer indicated the particular iconography of Flemish from various. 
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flemish Fotografía, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of Fleming, more every day," explains the creator, who makes it clear that "Flamenco-people" "can be people anyone but, having seen the photos, the observer can see that they are not the typical images of artists in the stage. 
These people revealed for "in the street" are artists of passing on stage passion, sadness, joy... cautivando the public. 
To catch the personality of these artists must not take pictures of the scene. 
Have your personality and character within. 
What I wanted was to create an intimate atmosphere to engage with the chamber the personality of the great Flemish. " 
With the taste of the festival "Cante land mines," Bauer began in 1.997 a long journey to portray the cantaores, guitarristas or bailaores with a chamber of plaque. 
Are pictures that, due to the selection of the camera and material recalls the classic photograph. 
The application of different estilísticos media breaks with the traditional basis of the image, thereby modernity, which reflects how the Bauer the Flemish: "A music with very traditional roots, which develops and surprised every day". 
It is not the action of the dance, sing or curfew in itself, but the personality of the artist, its character, that captive with their art to the public. 
The search for a meeting with mainly with the duende that is visible in a form of feel, and they are and have been the constant in this work who presents these days in the gallery The Fotómata.

The project has become a sort of Fleming, soon to be published in a book that will detail the portraits exposed in the sample. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer took him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Retratos of sportsmen veterans" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know and be able to enter a moment in his life, long or short. 
I believe that within the photograph portrait is the most difficult gender. 
You find yourself or enfrentas with people, characters, that sometimes did not know, or just leave a few minutes to take the photo. 
Despite these circumstances, as photographer, always try to make my ideas ".

"Blood of May ', the epic of Garci 
By drawing on the National Episodios of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci do you recreate the famous lifting of Spanish against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in its filmografía approximately 15 million budget. 
In this way, the film-maker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and the social analysis" has always admired in the work of the renowned novelist, has today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Díaz and Paula Echevarría at the head of a broad range of interpreters. 
Blood of May, with a higher metraje to the two and a half hours, is there to this Friday in cinema halls, to become the future in a miniserie for Telemadrid of more than four hours. 
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci ensures that we have done this represented "a dream of childhood", that should be thanking Hope Aguirre, who since the Madrid charged three years ago got a tape made by the 200th anniversary of 2 from May, which always accepted and when the story was based on the National Episodios. 
The 15 million budget that has brought in the Madrid are to Garci a "unique opportunity" of ambientar with the decorated and dress fit the image of a "Spain aimlessly that it was wrong of head to aim for, given that, the fight for independence took the people backward with the reign of Ferdinand VII," said. 
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding as Alatriste or the ghosts of Goya - more than double the Blood of May, so he has not been able to keep some plastered scenes in a script signed alongside Horace Valcárcel, with whom she worked almost throughout his career. 
Therefore, the director of Volver to start, has impacted on the which is his usual form, the stage with the players, the usually before test launch of the single and those who do not casting, by beggar "humiliating" and that "part of the job of director lies in the theatre and cinema to see what happens in the industry in which works". 
Many of the interpreters with that line in Blood of May found in his house, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, of Carlos Paco or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
The Oscar on four occasions - of which won one, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year in the Academy of Hollywood, the blood of May, Seven tables of French "and finally selected, The blind girasoles, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema," which is supposed to know, "he assured. 
With this film Garci not expected prizes. 
"In the early days you think that trabajas for posterity, then you notice that only trabajas for prosperity, and now you conformas with make a film more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career. 
Elizabeth Bayón retains the essence of the dancers sevillana Tórtola Valencia 
A bailaora sevillana is going to pay homage to a also sevillana dancer. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and operating mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and when she was three years moved to London with his family. 
It was a dancer of free dance and specialist in Eastern dances. 
A fascinating life, pioneer of the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
Was Buddhist and vegetarian and called for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free female movement. 
The life of this woman that marked a dancística and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, loved how to Elizabeth Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this man and I felt incredible". 
According to the bailaora, "we do not have their lives but to collect her spirit. 
The titles of their dances I have suggested the Flemish. 
As well, "the dance of the butterfly" I suggested a guajira, or "dance" a tangos. 
Their dance was sensual and my have told me that my dance also is within this aesthetic, "says. 
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda that again cantará to Elizabeth in one in their shows, as it did in the "The door open"; and with the teacher Matilde Chorale, who once wanted to work with anyone outside his intern. 
"Matilde ago of Tórtola of greater, the character of the maturity. 
I am happy because he accepted act in my work and I am very honoured by this ".

The work also account of the life of this woman in very remote locations, especially for the era, and India, the United States, or Russia, apart from across Europe, which usually living in London. 
"I wanted to remember it because I think it is for women who have enormous influence in a particular period and now no one knows much less in value their work," says Bayón. 
The show will start today at 5 in the theatre Lope of Vega. 
The publication of "Journal of a poet newly married" also closed the Trienio 
The presentation of the first edition enlightened "Journal of a Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's 790 000 (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez gave marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the planned activities by the Department of Culture of the Andalucian to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organised to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and death of both.

America is less like without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of them. " 
The phrase is the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia of malice", and the idea of the distress of American cinema, and across America, to the shock that Newman has been. 
Sights that cost him an Oscar. 
And that was withdrawn from 2007. 
And who knew that he was very ill. 
Yet it has been a huge blow to all. 
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence". 
No one was afraid of doing the ridiculous or exaggerate. 
Had killed a father of cinema and homeland in a particularly unfortunate moment, with fear the terrorists and the markets, with the American self-esteem by soils, seeking desperately reasons for dignity. 
When hard is the time and under the men and few beings who admire you, do not need to be Cernuda Luis for love Paul Newman. 
Embodied for all almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
Was formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost causes and won, from the foundation for combating drugs held in honour of his primogénito died of an overdose until their brand of hoarding and organic food. 
A gift to a country that has had to fight hard to overcome a food culture. 
The admiration barría Hollywood without giving nationalities or passports. 
The last James Bond, Daniel Craig, who has not died a man but an era. 
English, the oscarizado director Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman was the pinnacle of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman its greatest inspiration. 
"Has left us very high at all," concluded George Clooney, perhaps one of the few that dares to try to live as experienced Paul Newman: maintaining high standards of probity and have a private life serious and far removed from the chambers. 
This is not always easy or even possible in the media jungle of today. 
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example. 
It divorció once but then was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, that was true when he too many opportunities. 
"But what to eat hamburger outside of home, if within my steak?", used to play himself. 
In the sky assisted the pride of that in the land their daughters coincide with their anoraks, something not as common in America. 
"Of all the major papers that he interpreted, none was so proud of devout husband, father lover, caring grandfather and philanthropist devoted, they say. 
The imperfect career of a Madrid Olympic 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to be held in Madrid a few games and, after the failed 2012, it can be the 2016. 
But I wonder, are we? 
If we follow the example of the race yesterday, I say no! 
The perfect race the olden days and I think has been the worst career with much in which I have been. 
A height of absurdities that, of course, if you take into account as assessment and I looked, it would be a very ice clear. 
But now split and from the beginning. 
The proportion begin with the collection of backbone, you just have to go early. 
I do not consider it, but if you are going to give it everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race). 
Not quite. 
Here you better go to collect the backbone (first inanity, only go for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, had only fits all 'S' for the jersey (second inanity, because I need a size XL) 
In what world we live? 
Or is that by the crisis have decided only buy small T-shirts with less spiders and cheaper? 
Well, things like these are minor compared with those of the race. 
Apart from that have to go very soon to collect the chip, the queue at is 15 minutes and, moreover, have the rucksack. 
More than 35 minutes lasted until, incomprehensible to a career where it is expected to more than 11,000 people. 
Then, unexpectedly, began the race and we still had not left the rucksack, although once achieved, the collection was worse. 
Also, the rain amenizó the hopes of more than 40 minutes, coupled with of popular rebellion and assault to the booth. 
I believe that some 500 people probably tomorrow pulmonía, and some as I, even appearing with the right time in the rankings, due to the chip that gave me that, I imagine, I am not marked the departure correctly. 
Of course, if I were to ask for the perfect career, this does not fly in my thoughts. 
So I think that we will continue to an Olympic city well prepared. 
Microsoft receptionist search (virtual) 
In the conference Emergentes Technologies MIT Microsoft has shown progress of a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, like asking a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the campus of the company) to what we heard in the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people in the room, who they are - even remember what lead - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations. 
Also adding to the groups of conversation. 
In the video shows the receptionist detects a third person but understands that does not belong to the group that is talking with her, and that is not an employee of the company. 
I question if it is there to visit someone and said that he will soon. 
All without blue pantallazo. 
Impressive. 
But that, of course, is the future. 
Now the company has better things to focus, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has been talked about for a change of strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be more casual and will not have as many related programmes. 
Steve Steve has discovered that if computers come with the instead of full of commercial basurilla, would five times faster - man, Steve, this would be for less. 
A discovery bearing in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of course. 
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing value, and also the software. 
When Google Chrome went out into the network, was one of those who joined the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many pointed rightly that a browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential ozone to the Hardware and the result will be. 
Plays the same role that his wife or their husband when you must say something to his mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
Never go away but we need to think about the "death" of operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative. 
What Steve said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
People less and less attention paid to the operating system, and the Web browser. 
The computer is only begins to implement the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and spend more time in the environment of windows. 
Why are half of the applications that are in the system? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 must be less, much less that Vista. 
Less oil, less busy, less complicated. 
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its services online, and that are an alternative to Google. 
What desperately need, in fact, and I bring a small example. 
The photograph of this post was in one of the rooms for employees of Microsoft, in Redmond earlier this month. 
In the machine of drinks a poster asks you use your tool of search - "kept batting search. Our future". 
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to look for in the network. 
Last week, incidentally, also confirmed a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
There will be no early in 2009 but at the end, throwing to 2010. 
In Microsoft probably will look at the launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone is, after all, every day. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already in the street, going to pass the bill. 
I Fabuleux Marcel 
Paul Picasso was getting on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo Caprio di sported a "Diamante of blood" of Edward Zwick, same as Al Pacino in 'The Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola and form part of the uniform of the parish musculada gay.

Repeat offenders drivers by alcohol will install the alcolock ' 
Internal wants the driver with three administrative sanctions by alcohol, installed in a system that prevents rip the drunken vehicle, or if not blow.

The alcolock what already would prevent is a system connected to the vehicle that measured the alcohol in espirado air and rip the car if the driver does not abtes windy; or when it detects a concentration of alcohol is permitted. 
The cost is more than 1,000 euros and falls to the sanctioned. 
In this sense, a study in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices cut up to 65% during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: address this behaviour before they escalate into criminal offences. 
And, since the legal reform can be done by proper, and yet the necessary reform criminal requires a reform in an organic law.

If someone thinks that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as the work or through personal relations, this' manual "refuting such a belief. 
Moreover, offers other procedures as being in touch with nature and recipes 100% natural that contribute to the relaxation. 
If the adrenalin stage by your veins to bring balance to the body and the stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the sofa, shut down the mind and focusing on the reading. 
Talking in their 
Some children speak for the night. 
I am not referring to these very little money-grubbers telling us something has happened the previous day, but children are still asleep. 
The first thing to you take a scare, but in reality, it does not matter. 
It is a benign alteration of the dream that is called somniloquios. 
Quite often, especially in children and adolescents. 
Sure that most of you have been told that he spoke for the night. 
This phenomenon can occur very sporadic manner (once in a lifetime for example involved a episode of high fever), or of more regularly (all the time, once a week, once in meseS...), the following day the child does not remember nothing. 
There is no single cause which determine its appearance. 
They are often linked to other alterations of dream as usually the nightmares, night terrors, the night enuresis (becoming pis asleep) or the sonambulismo, but it need not be this way. 
As we mentioned earlier can also be linked to tables of very high fever, to situations of stress or sobreexcitación. 
But it is a phenomenon not studied. 
The intensity with which also features is very variable. 
It may be that speaks in a tone of calm voice, spare words, a murmur or otherwise (cries, weeping, long speeches …). 
In those cases where the demonstration is strong should see the child and consultation with a specialist, to see if there is any question that is creating great anxiety and gives out of this way. 
We have said that is a benign change, therefore has no treatment, except that he is associated with another alteration of dream that could treat (if, for example, is associated with apnea of dream or a picture of stress). 
What can be done is to take into account a range of measures very simple preventative such as: 
Not much excite the child before going to sleep. 
Therefore seek reassured games and avoid programmes or television series to be of fear or a little violent. 
With very nervous children and to be very difficult for them to relax, you can use techniques of relaxation to help them acquire some internal calm. 
This will be that the child may have a more leisurely dream. 
Once that's somniloquias try keep calm. 
'Remember that are harmless to the child and the next day not remember anything that has happened. 
Councils useful 
Not despertéis. 
It is useless, because he is not aware of, and I romperéis the dream. 
Although he is talking, it is asleep and is thus depend. 
'Remember if it shows very anguished over several episodes should consult or find out what generates anxiety in the child. 
If he means what he says (which is not typical), not caigáis in to the temptation of a grilling to coax information. 
Not simply nothing, because the nap is not aware as to organise their thinking. 
Also you oiréis what he says, but you know what is dreaming to say that, with this very careful in how interpretáis the information and with the conclusions that sacáis. 
I shall never say you the child that you can interrogate the evening to learn their secrets. 
Even in jest. 
This generates a lot of anxiety. 
In short, Don't, there is nothing wrong, is an episode that only lasts a few minutes. 
It illhaeusern finally! 
The football club, Illhaeusern, found the road victory in its field after a long period of shortages. 
Without having done a good match, the team created many occasions of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match. 
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the attackers had difficulty. 
After a first attempt of Kauffmann captain who rozaba the squadron shot by far, Illhaeusern quasi-fascist was going to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick by far, with Hirn above, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold proffer to prevent the defence of Dannemarie. 
In front, not leave the centrocampista and just leave Riahi in position of attack. 
The second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoreboard to the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well placed to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt Diebold (53 '). 
But the scorer Illhousiens not can savour its happiness and will be forced to return in the cupboards a dozen minutes later and left the members of his team in numerical disadvantage. 
But Dannemarie will not take the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens that fell slightly to "restrict" their defence, except in the final seconds of play during which, after an important farfulla, the ball very happened near the cross-sectional area.

The first debate on Friday between both candidates in the White House was another to know who has triumphed between John McCain and Barack Obama. 
No surprise, the headquarters of Republican and Democratic campaign said its own victory in this duel televised that has been followed by a third of American families. 
The analyst political David Gergen considers that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, was not "quite" brilliant "to enable it to halt its low in the polls five weeks of the presidential elections. 
The institute Gallup, whose survey of public opinion published the Sábato past gives five points advantage for Obama (49% against 44 percent for McCain), decides that it is the Democrats who went well. 
Among the undecided voters, which are those that count, Obama was winning with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them are giving the victory to McCain, according to a poll CBS. 
Obama could confirm its advantage on Thursday with the good delivery expected its member of his, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin. 
"Would be a mistake to be underestimated. 
Has good instincts, "warned however Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenario McCain revealed his undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing the "naive" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that" accused several times. 
"I do not think that Senator Obama has the experience and to be president", also assured. 
These words have been repeatedly since yesterday in televised Republican publicidades. 
Obama stressed that he represented the future. 
Without desconcertarse, was concise and accurate. 
Underlined its ability to make good decisions, and restoring the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain not yet understood, while Obama, has already made," he said, this weekend, a television democrat advertising that accused the Republican by not having found the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans. " 
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing on you, denounced Obama, yesterday, ahead of 20 000 people who had gathered for a meeting in Carolina North under a hail bold. 
Did not make the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, which is seen by Americans as the most capable person to save the economy is on the brink. 
"Next week could be a decisive episode", felt, yesterday, the influential and Democrat Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel Vasconcelos, a former mimbro of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
According to the Democratic candidate, the financiario current disaster "is the end result of eight years of bad economic policy implementation by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain." 
Reaffirming that would nonetheless to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the shocks on Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also pointed out that the implementation of a comprehensive energy independence thanks to the promotion of renewable energy was their first priority, with the creation of a system of health and safety.

"In Minsk," ah election in Minsk? " 
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday afternoon in the main square of the capital Belarussian to reject with anticipation the results of the legislative. 
Some hundreds of Belarusian met on Sunday evening after the closure of the polling centres in the central square in Minsk to protest against the flawed nature of the legislation. 
While no outcome still had been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of the president Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, must resign". 
Some recognize his: "Why, who will do what they want with my vote," says a young. 
They do not believe that the regime was good for the foreign observers to renew the contact with the European Union is prepared to carry out democratic change. 
The sanctions, including l interdiction of visas for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are seen as clean for observers. 
They were not according to the opposition. 
"Have been at the side of the electoral commission and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," Iouri regretted Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Forces, a heterogeneous reunification of twelve parties. 
"Is a cosmetic change, says Alexandre Milinkevich, a former candidate for the opposition to the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the movement for European, because what is important is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive branch. 
If some members of the opposition in the parliament, it is because they have been nominated but not elected. 
"But to enter the parliament can mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and proposals of law." 
The opposition must enter the political game because "we need to start dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which has many debts from Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we may be a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the election process does not acknowledge the validity of the vote. 
The turnout figures seem too high, and that the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) favored manipulation. 
"Do you have election? Asked the leader Social Democrat Alexandre Kozouline, one of two recent political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum five opposition members of parliament, that serve better to power. " 
The silence of the evening appears once again in the square in October. 
In television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission celebrating its success. 
The interview - Blood is sure 
Héma-québec yesterday her 10 ° anniversary of its founding, and its chairman, Décary Francine, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safer and more effective suppliers of blood in the world. 
And above all, it the confidence of the public that had been vacilada by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As you know, the national reserves of blood administered by the Office of blood transfusion of the Red Cross Canadian have been contaminated by the Virus of Inmunodeficiencia Genetics (HIV) and the virus for hepatitis C during the 1980's. 
To address this problem and the discontent of the public, the government of Canada announced in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Horace Krever, who sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to this tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster not more effectively. 
While the judge Krever now de in presenting their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee which aimed to plan a new management system of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau fulfilled this mission. 
In the wake of reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec for providing Quebec and Society Canadian blood to supply all the other provinces and territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began their activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls Décary. 
The situation was grim. 
After many efforts to improve the safety of the blood products and much work over the years that followed, have regained the confidence of the public, "before says of proudly say that at the beginning of 2008, approximately 94% of the population quebequesa had in confidence in Héma-Québec. 
The Décary medical doctor noted however that "the confidence is extremely fragile." 
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec had of caution. 
In that time, asistíamos in Europe for the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Décary account. 
And we did not know if this disease could be transmitted by blood. 
Then as one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, whereby if we do not know and when a serious illness can come from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterised by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to the death, implementing measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, because we deny the blood of the people who had remained more than a month in the UK since the 1980s. 
But, a few years ago, was not shown in any doubt that the disease was transmitted by blood. 
This episode we showed that the precautionary principle that never had the sense. " 
In 1999 came on the market a technical much more sensitive of detection of HIV: evidence of acid nucleído that allow directly detected in the blood of the donors the presence of the virus and not the antibodies against the virus, which governed the evidence used to date. 
The evidence of acid nucleído allowed shorten the period between the time that the person had been infected and the time that the virus can be detected in the blood by our technical, explains the specialist. 
We could reduce this period in a duration less than a week. 
So we diminish substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing and that we cannot detectarles. 
These improvements were significantly lower the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today one person every 12 million runs the risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV. 
"That will be distributed 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As well as Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400 and 500 000 blood products, more from 24 years before comes along, a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product. 
I believe that today can in day receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain the health concerns, "says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is maintaining the safety of our products. 
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system. 
Last year on the island of Reunion's Chikungunya virus that example of West Nile virus, it is an insect in the blood. 
We must constantly be vigilant, "the doctor before Décary of stress that in addition to secure supplies, Héma-Québec also must provide sufficient supplies. 
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing. 
Because the treatments - more aggressive carcinogenic, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets. 
The ageing population also has consequences on the network of donors that brings together only 3% of Quebequeses admissible in blood donation. " 
All people with good health, and that suits the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of the people that their blood are not accepted, because the incidence of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if travelled in a country where malaria, will be excluded for a period of a year. 
"With this 3%, managed to keep a scorecard that covers the needs of hospitals. 
The hardships are very rare. 
But that the members of this network of donors as they get older and no more can give blood. 
But it is difficult to convince the people donate blood, but keep them and encouraging them to be regular donor. 
Since the current life is very frantic, rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate blood, "is concerned about Décary Francine. 
With a budget of 297 million annual dollars, Héma-Québec economy supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, grafting with, valvas cardiac, eye balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for severe burns. 
These tissues analysed, processed and before frozen of stored in Hema-Québec, which also operates the only public bank umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was viewed as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
"Have had a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth of umbilical cord blood and is expected to draw more than a thousand of these a year. 
Needs to move to grafting at the beginning of next year, "precise Décary Doctora which describes this programme of blood of cord as very popular. 
"Many mums are disappointed not to be able to benefit from this," since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals of Quebec.

Charest deals North 
The prime minister does not preclude launch elections before the end of year 
As soon as the general counsel of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest yesterday was in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be choose during the partial election today. 
Reject the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force in the process, at the end of the general council's Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, were projected images. 
Desfilaban, in three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. 
Big media and during the election period. 
The first minister thinks that the elections will be held this autumn, although showed that his time was very full. 
The "according to Ireland" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister is seeking to Quebec, of a "new economic space", which sees an agreement on the workforce with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the narrative of the prime minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to 49 ° parallel - he had never been a presentation. 
The prime minister did not explain why the North was "a jewel the immense potential," but not a word, amounts of investment, or precise priority in future projects. 
That could certainly be more developed are: particularly the hydro-electricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, taken drugs by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of the public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to the description of Mr Charest. 
This "territory two times as France", "is home, in Quebec. 
Not only is home our, but in us, "insisted, as to show that called a myth national founder. 
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: the flood to gold in Abitibi, engineering quebequesa, Guantanamo James. 
"Belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to consider the vast map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebecois, comprises part of Labrador that Quebec always claimed, specified the prime minister during the press conference. 
"Is a traditional position that all governments have confirmed. 
There is a line of border in which not go for a long time, and when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate that position of the government, "he said. 
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of Korea," declared the passage in the north-west, due to open each year due to the casting of the ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the Raw United and the Inuites? 
The first minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit, particularly the young. 
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the party Quebecois of Ungava), have already begun consultations about thirty of communities. 
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Mrs and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and natural Resources) has an important role began some work. 
The prime minister does not preclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but at a meeting in which "will provide a common vision." 
The development of North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North "will be reached, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a in continuity with the liberal ministers before it. 
"And liberals that preceded us, we thought of another way to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was one of the recurring themes of weekend, which began Friday with a large cocktail for the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party. 
One of the resolutions proposed rename the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout. 
"Godbout, which created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay James our party could shape the future," said John Charest. 
At the press conference, invoked another reference, that conservative, the programme "Roads true to the North" of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
On the subject of a hydro-electric dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that his service is planned by 2012. 
"Well, this is between us, but I plan to be there," entrusted to its militants, provoking applause. 
Indeed, the first minister, who said in April that would not come about elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, not ruled out the possibility of implementing a vote this autumn, what the law allows it. 
He stresses that his time is full, particularly because of a mission of the board of the federation in China and a summit Quebec-Nueva York York. 
The general advice for weekend abasteció the liberal head a platform that included nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" who had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec calls in particular for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
Also wants Quebec behalf to members of the Council of the broadcasting and the Canadian telecommunications and that they have a right of veto over decisions made in Quebec. 
The side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad outlines of the plan Korea with scepticism. 
The party boss of Quebecois, Pauline Marois, did highlight the development of northern Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001. 
In her opinion, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, withdrew it. 
Had he done so, "we made progress today in" Mrs lass Marois by its candidate in Jean-Talon (vote today made), Jill Mercure. 
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Plan of the government. 
"But what you want, is that it is not just a spectacle," said the leader Sebastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, which holiday today. 
Letters - a country defiled 
Is Mr Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (oh, irony!) in the cabinet Harper, that last summer say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada. 
So dishonouring this woman who led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration that speaks volumes about the prime minister, Stephen Harper. 
We are in charge of a government that is the only, among all Western countries, which has not repatriated to its national who is imprisoned in the concentration camp of Guantánamo. 
It is a government that does not take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager when the facts are recriminados occurred. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on his promise and chooses to live in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only thing that chonta with false justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers, particularly, argue the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to win the benefit of a fair process in Canada. 
Is this government that closes its eyes on torture: not care that a young adult psychologically be destroyed, doubtless forever after so many years of violence. 
Yet we do not realise it, but witnessing this moment as an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continuous repeat and that makes no sense. 
The time has come, in which no moral exists more: we can mistreat, tortured, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen and wants the head of government until now minority (what will happen after of 14 October?). 
Many voters believe that will be the salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government resigned to what he was doing the reputation and dignity of our country. 
Mr Toews the embarrassment caused by this renunciation and nothing more. 
Opinion: The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold site 
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the mining Canadian Barrick Gold site. 
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold site says that the largest aurífera in the world has a process for defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small house editorial in order to bring about a "public open debate". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, is not the truth that judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law. 
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver. 
Why, according Barrick Gold site, the best way of running a public debate would harm anyone dares to sustain a contrary position to yours? 
The outcome of the case is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare his defence and, with very unequal arms, an army of lawyers held by the pockets almost hole of the mining. 
The tactic, in different struggles, is often is ruining to defendants in order to impose a friendly that amordazará the opposition addition to frighten anyone dare to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick truly Gold site had wanted a public debate, is of public opinion that would have had to present its vision of the events. 
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where works Barrick Gold site, the debates in Canada are normally do for the exchange of ideas and not with sticks. 
It was then that the mining to open their books, files and set up a real debate, from the newspapers, the media, publications and financing independent teams search that could have clarified the issue. 
But Barrick Gold site seems not to trust the public and rejects the petitions and letters of support to the perpetrators of Noir between Canada. 
Does possibly Mr Garver could explain how can ask for a debate "public" scorning the views of this? 
According to the vice-chairman, it appears that the word only appointed lawyers very paid and not for the Canadian; that is a very limited the concept. 
In a democracy, the detractors also have the right to speak. 
They do not understand - or what not to understand - Barrick Gold site, is that the public that the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada does especially because it rejects the brutal way of the mining. 
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and to judge, but basis changes civilised of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a persecución-mordaza (chasing the "public debate," Barrick Gold site just been placed a call to the authors of Noir between Canada intimándolos to not use that word). 
Besides the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the process of Barrick Gold site is a direct assault on the freedom of university search and truth, essential couple all democratic societies. 
Denied the right of credible sources and make a debate on the facts and the interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to consider and discuss subjects who dislike to rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, many persecution, who can? 
If Barrick truly Gold site like a public and transparent discussion, could follow the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir between Canada. 
It has a right of reply. 
The university world, to which we belong, known for a long time to administer the debates and the disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The persecution of Barrick Gold site clearly shows that, contrary to claims, is in no mood to do a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments are devices that limit this type of abusive prosecutions. 
Operation to rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the rescue plan for economic most important since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars that seeks to stop the financial crisis that is affecting Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Houses of Congress. 
Particularly expected: a better control by the elected its implementation, new mechanisms that are intended to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, the new provisions to contain the number of seized houses the lack of payment, as well as right on wages paid to the leaders of the often-quoted companies. 
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations che they lasted two days. 
"Made great progress on an agreement will be effective in the markets," declared the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to covered the economy and the American ordinary before the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the democrat. 
"Is the key point: if we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be huge," declared the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations have ended up quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that could cause a new failure in the mood of investors. 
The last time that had been set was the opening of markets this morning. 
The two candidates in the American presidential election, which was later joined the negotiations, showed more favourable to the agreement, however to squeeze their discontent of being forced to come to this popularly. 
The senator, Democrat Barack Obama conferred on him certain provisions to reach the agreement, which would allow homeowners to keep their home and on the salary of the leaders of the survivors companies by the state. 
"When asked to taxpayers take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is not welcome. 
But these measures are necessary, "commented on the American television. 
His Republican opponent, John McCain, Interrogado in another chain to know if he would vote on the proposed plan, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope it." 
"The important points that I read [show] is something that we we digest and with which we can bring. 
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. " 
The plan of 700 billion to buy with the money taxpayers the dubious debts, the assets to risks and unsaleable of the financial American institutions. 
Comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of the mortgage credit risk before spreading to other more common forms of credit (PCAA) and provoking a freezing of liquidity and an exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
It is a group of elected Republicans that had changed the first draft of the agreement, last week. 
We believe that we have got out of the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain assets "toxic" of the companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
With the aim of smooth out the rough edges for everybody in the Congress, also adding a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this programme, could impose new rates that would help him recover money. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion which may be added 100 other billion if the president seems necessary. 
The payment of other 350 billion would have to be confirmed by other vote of Congress. 
In exchange for aid, Washington will get shares in the often-quoted companies that earn dividends in case of profits and could return to sell when the storm will last. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of embargoes which related to the housing obtained with home loans under this plan, as well as set limits on the pay and on compensation in cash paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis. 
The architects of the plan would see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today and to the Senate next Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, still is not sure that his plan will be approved. 
Some people continued yesterday to protest against this project, from both Republicans and Democrats. 
The Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the committee of the finances of the chamber, said her constituents that "clearly, Washington does not want to understand". 
"Have a financial problem very serious. 
There are solutions. 
But not to take advantage of taxpayers. " 
The representative democrat Brad Sherman, which is a promoter of a small group in Congress, has the problems of another, but to reach the same conclusion. 
"400 teachers of economy, including three Nobel Prize winner, wrote to us saying to us, we call on the Congress not hurry and carefully examine the path to take," said yesterday. 
At this moment, in Europe, we had the test of the global nature of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis by 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the bank French BNP Paribas give that refusing to buy its rival in bankruptcy since lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of the home loans in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty European banks are larger and more of the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not money lost, said yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos. 
Instead, we have a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is something that savers and families now appreciate that times are uncertain. " 
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take all the loans outstanding in the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 billion euros (75,5 billion dollars) of home loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander took yesterday announced that it would buy the branches and the bank accounts of British bank. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, the British government would have to nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
His blue eyes accounted for so long its triumph. 
The American player with a smile charming had been released from narcissistic hand? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was also will have removed from the register of power they have the real sacred monsters. 
But what a major corridor of substance. 
Paul Newman, died on Friday, at 83 years, because of a lung cancer in its ranch of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fanfare years. 
It is wonderful that Brando, whom much seemed and that was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in their game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of the dramatic conventions. 
The blood mixed often make wonderful children. 
Born in Ohio in 1925, of Jewish German father and mother in Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots will lead one of the glorious sides of the American dream. 
Without ego bloated last quality mark. 
Because it has a whole country in Love of self made man, of fighting of the war in the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early years of the 50 studied the dramatic art at Yale, then frecuentó the Actor 's Studio in New York, before winning in the theatre, television and soon in the cinema. 
This man militó for civil rights was also the pilot car that classify in second position within 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled for a thinking symbol, although a member of a couple shapes up in 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret star, unobtrusive and committed, allergic to the scandals of show business not know very well. 
It is a decent man, in the widest sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman brought chaos to the cinema goers this weekend, while entrechoquen their large roles in the black screen of memories. 
More than a half-century of seventh American art in perpetual change marching through it. 
Many memories are memory as the cow-boy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects your sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Gata on the roof of zinc adapted of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to home (1990), discussed his sensitive Mr Bridge, fractured by a marriage she did not meet all its promises. 
Others like Paul Newman has the history of cinema. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, rogue, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up ’ there Likes – I am (markings by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, after repeated his death, which launched to Newman in 1956. 
This nice mangante in the suntuosa film The Sting (The Cheap), Oscar to the best film in 1973. 
Player of bitter and avenging "in the wonderful film The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), repeated the character in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which gave him in 1987 his only Oscar between nine nominations. 
This view that changes over the years, it was him. 
Yet it. 
The times change during his career. 
The young people they mainly thanks to Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of ice hockey little orthodox. 
Its called again seen in 1994 in The Proxy Hudsucker of the brothers Coen. 
With a final role of godfather of the mafia Irish in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the picture was complete. 
Contrary to several legends of cinema that quite left the race, Newman was much was in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its oros, its fanfare and its concessions. 
The film-maker French Bertrand Taverniers what he believed, with good humour, "as a challenge that lives in" the underplaying "and that it deems their benefits too supported. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman at that papers came during a long time. 
But less hiccups often the role of young galán that theory: neurotic, alcoholics, cabrones or desperate, whose features mirrored the rebellions. 
As film-maker, Newman revealed sides its true sensitivity modestly not. 
His film Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (in the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott because of overdoses, devoted his film Harry and Son in 1984, workforce of modesty and sadness. 
"Between the many tributes which yesterday triggered for Newman, his great friend and former colleague of weapons Robert Redford (had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened by that" my life and my country were better thanks to its existence " 
Generosity and love of existence are important features of the player died. 
On the other side of his career of legend, there is a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, the independent cinema, a refusenik against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We have long seen his face reign on the vinagreta sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foodstuffs, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although began as a joke. 
The benefits of these sales were given to his Foundation for the child in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than just its myth, will be committed to the end. 
They left their five daughters a letter that contained these phrases: "always and until the end, your father incredibly was grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege of there be. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist very lucid and so generous. 
A citizen model. 
What is it that were in the factory of bills Zuschlag & Co.? 
Very soon, on 8 October, will begin the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and their accomplices. 
It accuses the political and their accomplices of fraud of significant damage, so business, and in addition crime of other crimes, including the falsification of documents. 
According to the Public Prosecutor used for their own ends the proceeds in public tenders justifying on many occasions the implementation of the tasks with false invoices. 
The public funds and local councils - in its entirety about 65 million HUF - stop in part in the treasury of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal and in the purse of individuals. 
The method, which was published by researchers also, was to justify the collection of the funds raised in public contracts with false bills behind which I had not real implementation, the various associations never met its obligations. 
According to the indictment, the majority of the bills were false. 
To get the talonarios in the District of Józsefváros and stamps circulars were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the issue of who in the name of what was needed to make the falsified bill was decided between other on that tour of the Higher Region of Balaton posthaste János Zuschlag sent to István Lados. 
This finally confessed to should pick hostales and restaurants. 
Asked bill for their duties and served as a model for the bills he received between other competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Deportivos Affairs at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as in the city of Capital. 
These bills were signed in the main by István Lados and his accomplice Őri András, who according to our information rather scribbled the necessary reports to obtain public subsidies. 
During one of their "study tours" Lados chose a beer. 
According to two bills issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and their accomplices, this culinary center provided food for a group of people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager of the centre - many people have no place at the same time. 
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual mistakes. 
As a hostal the town of Badacsonytomaj was only three rooms and more than 10 people could not this spacious in a night, but the bill did cent and 30 people. 
But the manufacturers of bill of great fantasy also greatly exaggerated noting the culinary Pigal Kft. because in the true of the same - according to the information given to the Public Prosecutor - had not documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and of Hoppá. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, told at hvg.hu than when he was quoted by the public prosecutor and showed him the bills, already knew that it was false documents. 
"In the name of our company and the NIF Monster appeared in the wrong place." 
He added: in addition to the formal problems either line that according to the bill housed hundred people, because they have only 11 rooms in which there are so many people. 
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant is long past time that does not work. 
Manufacturers enthusiasts of bills are not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the bill payment in cash were identified as service a trip in Hungary, which also coincided with the practice of issuing of bills for the agency. 
Moreover, as it became known for the research included in the document the VAT also, despite that travel outside the European Union released were from taxes. 
Among other things the also VAT was incorrect in the four issued documents by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jövőért, since the services of this company are not loaded with 25 but only 15 percent of VAT, the employees of the hotel only extended bills to machine but the bill was manual. 
And the "agents" committed other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which the bill as the road transport and which it emerged during the investigations of the office - not the company founded as consultant of investment. 
Also for formal differences - inappropriate format of the bill, stamp false - it emerged that are false invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for century. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont. 
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Campamento of Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused have issued these bills. 
Counterfeiters not paid attention to when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület there ate (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, the head of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied have issued such a document. 
Deliberately were issued invoices 
Another group of manufacturers of false bills are made up for those who were aware that they had issuing fake bills. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued bill of some four million HUF on behalf of the Foundation Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért. 
The manager of Collab Kft. - According to the indictment, he persuaded one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing fake bills. 
So working with Zuschlag and their accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under process, which in 2003 submitted bills for around five million HUF to the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the association Atlasz Egyesület and partnership Vörösfenyő Egyesület, without real economic activity behind. 
There was no movement of capital, having cancelled the bills ready but forgot to put on their documents to this entity. 
In the next group of manufacturers of false bills include those who have some link to the accused. 
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the demandadero of manager Ukrainian of the Delta Trio SL with fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade of alternative fuels and vehicles. 
This company issued numerous bills for around 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of IT resources. 
According to data from the research these bills were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, that since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation process. 
The manager of the company was a Romanian who Ivan Kubatov should have also released documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005. 
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation, which was issued on behalf of the company bills for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány but the amount he himself. 
The Jos Fa-Bani Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian against bricklayers to specific request of Ivan Kubatov. 
However, none of the companies actually worked because, according to the accused - that didn't work. 
But took advantage of these companies, at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Szente Zsolt, who produced the documents of the company, issued bills on behalf of societies for organisations linked with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, of Jos Fa-Bani, of Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave in total 15 bills to entities for a value of 14,2 million of HUF. 
The prosecutor said that Kubatov receiving the VAT and 10% of the bills. 
This man even took the society in comandita Szi-Beri for issuing fake bills used in the contest Biztos Pont. 
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January of 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (EBA), entity of public utility of the Socialist Party. 
The contest received 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money to the goals of the contest. 
For that not to be found, presented the MRI five fictitious invoices from the Works Team Kft. 
These were the bills found during the raid of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had in the headquarters of the Ministry of Education. 
Part of the defendants probably relatarán in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor - the course of the counterfeit bills. 
What is most interesting may be the confession of own main accused János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle all. 
Because their confessions so far have not been very detailed and although repeatedly promised to talk about, that it has not done so. 
The question is: what interest is it?, perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists came to an agreement with him to Zusi takes on all the responsibilities. 
Who, on the other hand, these days until he was offended, for to alleviate their prison conditions called house arrest, but was repeatedly refused. 
While many authors of economic crimes of much higher value, which never paid back the money, freely walk or at least can expect in your own home the judgment, he has no chance for that. 
Psychology of the sobrepuestas: Why we spend more money? 
The participants of the auctions are prone to spend more money and overstate the product. 
The neurologists and economists from the University of New York discovered the neurological basis - economic of this known and seemingly irrational. 
According to the study published in the journal Science, the people not to lose in powers as auctions of eBay, why prefers to pay too high a price. 
The scientists tried to set up the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auction. 
One of the groups of volunteers working lottery, the other was involved in an auction and was examined by the system of magnetic functional resonance (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of participants in the experiment. 
In both games could earn money the participants, but for the auctions, where it is vital element more bet that the game was intensified the functioning of the complex called into stratum below the cerebral cortex. 
This area of the brain, as well as many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "car prize" of the nervous system. 
As well as scientists, increasing the stakes can be explained as a prevention order not to provoke intense reaction of the body. 
To back their theory, economists of scientific group also made a study of financial follow-up. 
In this experiment three groups who bet against a person in different circumstances. 
The control group were simply told the real value of the product in question, and its members who bet. 
Another group also have been promised that, if won, would receive $15 more prize. 
In exchange, the third group exactly received 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the group even were losing money. 
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one highlighting the triumph and the other the failure. 
However, tested the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the group playing "against the failure" were willing to even bet more than the members of the group of control and the group "winner." 
"These results cannot be deducted from any existing economic theory. 
Because those until now showing how the phenomenon of auctions only with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks. 
Only the methods visual neurological helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, which are now coming to a third explanation "- set Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When must go to the doctor? 
In the world around 500 million people suffering from hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary's disease chronic liver is considered one of the main causes of death. 
Estimated 100,000 the number of infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many sufferers do not know they are infected. 
The name of hepatitis is the common name of various diseases liver caused by viruses. 
The symptoms are quite similar; are characteristic the infection of the liver and the jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused are very different. 
The virus hepatitis in dependence of agent spread with two main ways: hepatitis A and E for food (for example with water or food infected), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus in the blood and with personal whims (sperm, humour of the vagina, froth). 
It is advisable to travellers are protected by vaccine against the virus A and B, C, there are no vaccines. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A are two or three weeks after eating the food infected, manifested by means of a general, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea. 
After that appear in the skin and the target of the jaundice, the excremento been clear it, the urine of brown and cure can even last for two, three weeks. 
Every year a million people die in the world in cancer and cirrhosis liver caused by hepatitis B, the most severe forms of the disease. 
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in 10 infected receives pharmacological treatment. 
Hepatitis C also can have very serious consequences: without treatment can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer. 
The majority of those infected do not know that he is ill because this pathological agent destroys in gradually liver cell and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later. 
It is therefore important early recognition, the doctor systematic monitoring. 
It is much more frequent this disease into three groups: the people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who have tattoos. 
Currently there are about 200 million people in the world that suffer from hepatitis C chronic. 
As to this disease can be found with a routine monitoring of laboratory also worth it to consult with the doctor of the family to experience some symptom unknown. 
The disease can be cured if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus's body, we can suppress the spread and prevent cancer. 
The 30 September is the World Day of the Hepatitis, which was organised for the first time in 2004 by organisations representing the sick. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver caused by the virus and the importance of his premature recognition. 
You less painful to who believe in God? 
Depending on the outcome of a recent study, religious faith is very tempting effect that also aliviaba the death of the martyrs of Catholicism. 
Scientists from the University of Oxford were an interesting experiment: analysed that religious belief in what way affects the human pain - informed British Sunday Telegraph. 
In the context of this unique experiment conducted electrical shock to 12 believers Catholics and the same amount of atheists, but all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the faithful Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain. 
Thanks to the technique of MRI of the human brain, it could verify that believers Catholics were able to activate the part of your brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This experiment is the first of the series of research at the side of the academic also involved scientists, philosophers and theologians of the various departments of the University. 
The analysis was done the next; a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock. 
The researchers asked participants experiment that set their sights on two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, of Sassoferrato of the 21st 17 and the Lady of the ermine of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century. 
The researchers had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would lead to a true religious mood among the faithful, chose the because of Leonardo because was not so different from the other, and they thought it was reassuring. 
Patients spent half an hour in a scan of MRI, received in this period 20 electrical shocks in four successive parties while they see the paint of religious issue or the other. 
Catholics said they look to the Virgin Mary were in "security" as "protected", "reassured and his heart was the peace". 
Looking at the picture of religious issue were 12% less pain when back the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Farias Miguel also participated in the experiment, believes that with any image so shocking can be achieved a similar effect with the also atheists, only to find the good picture. 
"Should find a portrait of a person that feel very positively, as a mother or father" - said the psychologist. 
The bishop Anglican Wright Tom was the result of the investigation. 
"The practice of the faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - added Wright. 
After these formidable performance is just one question: what if for the regulation of pain if they show the faithful the Madonna of Leonardo or other painter his size? 
The vision of a Virgin Mary of high quality still spitting better results? 
You are what you say of yourself 
In its tenth birthday the Google can say: you can find both in the pocket of the people, as in the sky above his head; it knows where they spent their holidays, to what doctors visit and what interests them. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough. 
Furthermore the sceptics who do a parallel with the vision orweliana not see the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt recently told the newspaper Financial Times that the main aim of Google is the largest possible amount of personal data on its users, and this is necessary to meet the original objectives of the founders of Google: "meet in a system all the information in the world!". 
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that partially solved the world is still in the initial phase of efforts to deal with all the information. 
To the question that what is going to happen inside five years Schmidt and replied: I would like the Google could answer questions like "What do you do tomorrow?" Or "What would be the best I would?" - But the software will not be able to answer questions such apparently simple while there are not enough information from users. 
Not all the surfers are aware that during his navigation in the Network are stored with precision the key words clicked, the addresses of IP and pages where they spent the end of the search. 
Thank you for example to Personalized Search that began two years ago, users can store their own record of navigation, can return to consult before seeking, which opened and thanks to this record will searches more personalised in this same logic is the Recommendations, in which the system will provide products and services on the basis of the preferences previously defined and stored. 
What will happen if using my data against my, collected information on my activities? - Ask those who are seeing the information monopoly of Google. 
In most cases rather the potential for the company is what may be fearful and not the apology, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or rebellion against the power. 
It is a fact already confirmed that not only guarded, but in justifiable cases also yield to third all expressions clicked, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users. 
The most discussed of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google turned over to the Brazilian government's information page Web browser, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles. 
Instead, Internet users who are concerned about the rights of the people, in the month of May aliviaron when the airline with the EFF, organisation for the defence of electronic rights, successfully proved in court that was right in its dispute with the FBI, according to the ruling, he will be able to force Google, none of the points of the constitution to provide any information requested in secret by the FBI. 
(At the same time the federal government was able to get on the pretext of increasing law for the protection of children adopted years ago, nearly fifty thousand directions Web browser and a thousand phrases clicked, but without the lists of search for individual users, nor the full lists of Web pages and key words of the past two months.) 
This is quite contradictory the opinion on the Google: what about those who fear for their personal data because they think that harms their privacy, their private life to begin to use the services of Google, and they are protesting against her as against multinational companies of conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the culture American geek and their enthusiastic supporters, surfers and users of other countries, see them as the future generation, "Oracle of avant-garde", not to the rival Microsoft, classified by their Windows as conqueror World, both strive for the same goal. 
This can happen because the Google instead of Microsoft, does not ask users no identification code, or money for their applications, the code is open and the package of free programme, constantly currently and seems more youthful, more cooperative that the practice of giant official of the software. 
But it could also be because the geek see precisely the link existing problems between the rights of the people and the Internet that it was for one of the more words keys in recent years: the Web 2.0. 
The Web 2.0 is collaboration, trace behind of us and seize the channels available, and while the measures of these various individually, the essence remains the same: show us to ourselves. 
A normal young can have profile in many collective pages, ranging from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link up with other services, such as the Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their habits of music, then they can include in a monitoring system as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, may also have a blog, in which automatically appear the most recent galleries of photos that is stored in the Flickr or in the Picasa. 
We know many instances of that that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the following morning the common friends, learns who spent the night before his cheating boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because this writes his candid opinion on his blog on the direction of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of the private life is completely revalorizó. 
The life "on-line" a person is what it shows about itself - this is a definition which is behind the conduct of the youth of today. 
And he wants to hide something, or at least seeks to dodge the monopoly of Google, what can be done (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses the system of search with Google, but leaves no fingerprints). 
There are many people who do not want to register in the collective pages to prevent the can find, but they can replace the applications "on-line" Google, since the software of texts to the applications of image and reading of good news with alternative versions which did not connect with giant servers or preparing the most perfect possible profile on us. 
The public almost hopes that openly on the day that Google shows its true colors. 
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than the IBM (140 billion dollars), the Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the areas of AdWords / AdSense threaten the income of the advertising companies, in both the services they more and cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft, but also many other developers software companies. 
Critics observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions: for example senior management rejected outright the protest of employees then doubling the price of the nursery of the company, regarded as too expensive unlimited number of feeding of employees, but this is nothing compared with the fact that in the year 2006 the Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked information that violated the moral and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the rules of the company says that does not announce any new service in advance, but only when they are ready to operate, what is certain is that the anticipated problems of the months and years ahead will be looking to the world: while some believe that the project of MRI and archive of books and magazines of Google acquire such dimensions that soon company will be cited by the United States Supreme Court, others fear of its system Health, because we can create our own full health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems. 
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic data, can provide a good raw material for the writers of works of science fiction, the Scroogled, novel of popular of Cory Doctorow, described in orweliana form that future, in which a man only of data from Google can be alarmingly describe well. 
Two children helped remove traces the author of the double murder of the city of Ózd. 
The police questioned two minors on the double murder of Ózd who, according to justify suspicion, helped remove traces of crime - said Tuesday the spokesman for the General Office of Public Order of the province of Borsod.

According to information from the TIM, the young person much prepared before to perpetrate the crime, because he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the scene of the crime. 
The police investigated with an expert to the weapon and the circumstances of their use.

The Stock Exchange of Warsaw offered $200 million - some five billion kronor Czech - by 100 percent of the actions of the Stock Exchange of Prague. 
Sobolewski ludwik, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Warsaw confirmed the offer that made the Poles, although the Czechs previously excluded from the City of Warsaw of potential new owners of the Stock Exchange of Prague. 
The reason is that the Stock Exchange Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
99% of the action is in the hands of Polish state that within months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the same. 
The financial daily Czech E15 reported that the supply of the Polish was the highest among those offered by interested by the Stock Exchange of Prague.

On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
The main European newspapers in its comments Tuesday dedicated to the deep financial crisis talk of a "second 11 September". 
The global financial disaster is due to the US president - believes The Republic of Rome - the chairman has not even been able to gather support from his own party to the draft law hastily done, whose aim is to find a solution to this desperate situation... 
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", of the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is more accurate to talk of a "second 11 September". 
As a part of the public-spirited press, Washington is the scapegoat. 
According to El Mundo the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one which led to the global economy to the brink of disaster. 
There is also a growing danger of collapse of monetary American system and this course, will have an impact in the entire world. 
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, following the vote of congress is the danger that Washington does not offer political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy is hanging in the air - particularly when carried out one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism. 
We cannot ignore this threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states today can still out belt of lifeline to financial institutions creaking, thus saving the bankruptcy with taxpayers ’ money. 
But if as the sway more crumbling bank still, then it will not be enough nor the new funds, nor the new improvisations. 
We need long term that member states of the European Union set aside its nationalist selfishness and centralised control over the fragmented financial markets. 
The financial institutions in crisis so received Monday more than 100 billion euros, recalls the Der Standard Viennese, claiming that are increasingly real concerns that, as did the Americans, also European taxpayers will have to pay money to resolve the crisis. 
The EU has not yet been seriously dealing with the crisis that is as a cúname by the Old Continent. 
The saviours trampling will not have to immediately provide hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if defined: what is justified using taxpayers' money to avoid a greater evil? 
The Smart car imitates the flight of abejorro 
What would be the best method for developing technologies to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of sensors obstacles in nature? 
For example the abejorros. 
In a surprising project presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the abejorros gave the starting point for the engineers Nissan to design the next generation of the system for preventing collisions. 
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, devised the system of robotics direction of cars kind BR23C copycat nature, which gave the characteristics of the abejorros, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can cope with all the collisions. 
During the flight each abejorro creates its own space particular oval that in reality is very close to our protective capsule safety - explained in the Kazuhhiro explanatory Doi, technical director of PR and development and investigations. 
Play an important role the compound of the abejorros that are able to see in all directions a higher angle to 300 degrees. 
To copy the role of the eyes compounds, engineers used the system of measuring the length by lasers. 
This identifies the obstacles ahead of BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, estimated its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of vehicle that immediately becomes a move to avoid the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds is identified the obstacle, then the robot vehicle by mimicking the movements of abejorros, amending the direction revolves as necessary. 
Unlike any existing system currently, this manoeuvre is instinctive. 
"If it were not, the robot vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - Toshiyuki explains Andoh, chief of the Laboratory for Mobility and the project of robot vehicles. 
Should react and instinctively, since this technology to the internal ozone most vulnerable of the protective capsule safety, in a layer of which now are considered inevitable all kinds of collisions. 
The whole process must reflect what makes a abejorro by-passes other abejorros. 
This process must be done in an open and close their eyes. 
However, unlike abejorros, the movement cannot turn up, down or diagonal, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of change of the wheels 
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities for the abejorros by-passes other abejorros, here only used as a possibility for the robot of the rotating movement and speeding up the frenaje. 
The BR23C uses batteries of lítio-polímero that more are light and is increasing its density of energy, which means that they last longer life than of lítio-ión. 
According Andoh, what is important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction not capacity of processing of data, or the storage. 
This apparatus in every second only processed some signs of entry and react in the case. 
There is no need to store the data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from the previous manoeuvres, used only a few dozen kilobytes of memory. 
They are not needed memories of gigabytes, MB. 
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately the obstacles, which estimates of the Nissan, in ten years can join the models manufactured in number. 
Another possibility for its implementation is incorporating the unity the navigation system by satellite GPS for the driver to its destination, sidestepping the obstacles in their way. 
Already has name this costly child 
It has prepared the written version of the law of the package of financial $700 billion bailout of that will be implemented in stages with the purpose of buying the bad loans from the banks. 
In the first phase will be spent half the money. 
According to hours of the east coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight Saturday, the leaders of Congress reached an agreement on the package of financial rescue of $700 billion in total, after several days of debate - told the Reuters. 
We have achieved an important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic chairman of the American Congress, saying that such lack only formalise the agreement in a document. 
The commitment on the package was supported by both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the Finance Minister, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are required more. According to Pelosi, this is not to save Wall Street, but of giving back to the board of the economy. 
The written version of the package before published the size of the Asian markets, Sunday before 8 p.m., according to hours of Washington (before the two in the morning of Monday, according to hours of Central Europe), without triggering a spectacular leap in bags. 
On the draft law called emergency law to economic stabilisation of 2008, on Monday, first vote the American Congress and then the Senate. 
President George W. Bush on the night of Saturday consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
Are we happy with the progress achieved during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - declared Fratto Tony, the spokesman for the White House. 
The programme is different from the original draft of the Bush administration of spending all the $700 billion to buy securities of loan fund of poor quality. 
Now it can only spend half of the $700 billion, using 250 billion immediately after the Congress votes, probably on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit, bad rating and the fate of other $100 billion is because of the decision by the president. 
This programme will be controlled by a special body, which also involved the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the $700 billion can then be spent on a new decision of Congress. 
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a tactic combined: can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities of credit and other credits of "poisonous" also. 
The purchase would be in auctions or directly - reported competent people of ministry. 
The law allowed companies to participate in a programme of sure where the portfolio of finances ensures the worrying elements, why pay companies the amount to the likely damage. 
Henry Paulson stated: the law guarantees of financial means, which can reach even 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, the purchase of bad assets, your insurance or prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions. 
Do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law on sign - added. 
Instead, the heads of the banks that are in distress and expect the state aid will be able to have the official limitation of their compensation, that the American jargon simply called golden parachutes. 
Only in some cases, certain payments will be restricted, and the limitations of the form of aid from the ministry of finance. 
The limitation means that if the ministry purchase in the framework of an auction, an extra tax for the golden parachutes, unless that passes on the failed bank. 
The directly buy bad loans the government aggressively take action to ensure that the compensation of bosses are not exaggerated. 
And this is not going to change the contracts of parachute of gold, the restrictions will apply only to new contracts to encourage participation in the program. 
This is the first case in American history that will force a legal restriction to the income of the CEOs - said that the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the committee of Congress, responsible for financial services. 
The state also will have the right to buy shares of the banks in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because even to profit with the transaction as the economy and with it the bank. 
According to the bill in the next five years the president to present to Congress a suggestion of giving back to the net losses in the financial sector. 
Of course at both sides were who expressed reservations about the project. 
That is not what we American citizens, are not protecting the taxpayer dollars - declared the Republican congressman from California, Issa Darrell. 
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: measures urged him the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Magazine's press area of speaks German 
The group of right is intact, only that of the group became more aware constituents - says the Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of CSU in Bavaria. 
Haider and his supporters are ready to govern in Austria in order to prevent a red-green coalition. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of left Franz Walter, in an article titled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours their parents" looks at the reasons for the dramatic defeat of CSU. 
According to the famous political scientist, the erosion of the CSU is much had begun before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber would have assumed office. 
The Christian Socialists for decades were developed to Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning their back. 
The change was also a problem for the entire Christian democracy, Angela Merkel. 
The failure was not exactly surprising to the CSU, but Sunday was completed, a process that already provided for almost ten years ago: disappeared the undisputed hegemony of a state. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained a 47,7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s. 
This was repeated three years ago, in the elections in the Bundestag 2005, is still during the oft-mentioned era of Stoiber. 
The reason for this is through modernising the CSU in the devorador province of their parents. 
Sociologists as 40 years ago are already predicting that, but the pace was much wrong. However, the secularism, the results of the education and the settlement of the Germans North in developed regions of Bavaria saw their negative consequences for the fidelity of voters CSU. 
With the modernization is also increasing and it also has political consequences. 
The group of right is intact, only that of the group became more aware constituents, most critics and more stubborn. 
It is amazing that in recent weeks the conventional groups of citizens were the more left of CSU; self-employed, smaller, the high school and students. 
This recudió to less than 40 percent support for the CSU. 
Die Presse - (diepresse.com) 
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who? In his article entitled" The chairmen of the parties are very reserved in issues of coalition "- deals of the confused state of the internal policy after the Austrian elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP, prohibits the SPÖ trespass in its internal affairs.

Already the elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate in the public television, the leaders of the parties barely left see something of their horses. 
Faymann Werner, the president SPÖ, confirmed that wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that it is possible cooperation between the two parties - this already exists in some provinces and social associations. 
Fayman left unresolved the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the party, in the Junior. 
He said that in any case voiced opposition the era of Schüssel-Molterer. 
It is not possible to continue this policy trend. 
Mr Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers. 
He said that probably will not be successful cooperation if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the party. 
Is still open in the party if will choose the opposition or enter in the coalition, these issues should be discussed without any doubt, within ÖVP. 
The chairman of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider was open in all directions.

Járóka: that we must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today has been launched in Paris the European summit for Equal Opportunities, its host is France that this year is also president of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, a Member of the European People's Party on the Fidesz, in his message to the full, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew the attention of segregation in the education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit the gypsy children and also it is the biggest obstacle to the foundation prevale of their interests. 
This high-level conference was unveiled - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister of employment and social affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for jobs, social issues and of equal opportunities. 
Attended the meeting representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations to protect social rights. 
Járóka - according to the bureau's press group of Members of Fidesz in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to the discrimination in employment, gypsies are outside of the labour market in first place with its low level of education. 
"Most of the young Roma have not finished high school and because of the poor quality of primary education, only a tiny fraction can obtain university diploma". 
Járóka furthermore stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role in the foundation prevale of other human rights also. 
The investment in the teaching of Roma children at an early age could strengthen the economy of the United States of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, is widely concientizar these issues between both the Gypsies and not gypsies. 
Because while later start school a gypsy student, more likely to become an active member of the labour market; through taxes on income and consumption they will also contribute to the national budget. 
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, is to assure the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of the education segregated and low-level" - highlighted Lívia Járóka. 
According to the MEP, the objective and active unit of the European Union to speed up the process of school desegregation, that is of fundamental importance correct implementation of the directives existing and planned anti-discriminatory. 
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to offer the Roma children the possibility that ensures the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights" - called Járóka. 
The goal of the European summit for Equal Opportunities annually crime from the meeting last year in the star of the "Year of Equal Opportunities," is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities and of the United States. 
CSU: grace for a transitional period 
At the end of October, a decision will be made on the fate of failed duo Huber-Beckstein 
Despite the serious electoral defeat, have not yet been severed heads in the Biblical Bavarian CSU, for the moment has been put off the debate on personal issues. 
Erwin Huber, chairman of the party and Günther Beckstein, first provincial minister are still in their jobs, but do not know how long the grace. 
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic election defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the special party congress to be held the last week of October. 
The much-criticised duo hinted: not so much to their jobs. 
With this to reassure furious members of his group and its organisation, who a day after the "tsunami Bavarian" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority. 
Five years ago - but under the direction of Edmund Stoiber was at the top of his career - the socialcristiana union reached a 60,7 per cent, but now, a year after the crowded coup against Stoiber, managed only a 43.4 percent. 
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria's 18 per cent of GDP. 
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives remain dominant in the future certainly must coalition with someone. 
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal agriculture minister, one of the potential successors of Huber, also has a seat in the small group of intelligence that begins negotiations with the FDP liberal and with the Free Electores of Right on a possible coalition government in Munich. 
The strange thing about the destination is that in the list of the Free Electores enters in parliament that Pauli Gabriele, whose proceedings against Stoiber was used to the sound of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then severely deleted the scene the ambitious local politics. 
The leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies for stabilizing Beckstein. 
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now was moving the strings in the fund, the ex-jefe of government provincial and former chairman of CSU described on 28 September as the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday Huber did criticise the CDU, in his opinion had much deserved more support party's brother. 
Other political CSU people interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and the very Angela Merkel also. 
After the elections in September 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be Chancellor if they are not capable of bringing together the CSU which played a crucial role in the success of the national elections in 2005. 
According to Merkel to could hide their disappointment at the failure, the losses from the CSU will impact negatively on the major Berlin coalition. 
Which of course is relative: not will be easier to reach the CSU wounded and the crisis continues. 
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached their worst result since 1946 in Bavaria. 
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0 
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opponent in the Belarusian parliament. 
According to the Russian observers, that is with the welfare and stability that guarantees in the country Aleksandr Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this has more to do with the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes. 
The OSCE sent 450 observers from 43 countries, not recognised the election result. 
While the term of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated per cent and ten Members, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, that for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment to the Constitution this time "would allow" the entry of some members of the opposition in the parliament. 
The ODSZ thus removed the boycott that originally wanted to do. 
In the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was the Belarus, which increasingly depends economically from Russia - which took credit for the import of natural gas increasingly side of Russia and that contributed to the sale to Russia's Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that runs through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not permit entry to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians because of a political regime considered undemocratic. 
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, to assess the election campaign, placed emphasis is more on the positive phenomena and not on the mistakes - such as the ban to participate in a third of opposition candidates. 
However the report Monday of the OSCE even criticised the campaign - in which the candidate of the opposition could not appear in the press - and especially the opposition could not be present in the counting of the votes. 
With all this in the opinion of the opposition is an improvement in the political climate: were released political prisoners and Minsk is prepared to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with Belarus theoretically is a federal state - a month ago that he believes the two regions as independent. 
- We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important is that it has opened the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union - declared our newspaper Alyaksandr Milinkevich. 
According to the opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 is desirable maintain this situation, "that the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even an opposition in parliament without weight." 
The opposition is not planning to organise demonstrations in protest at the results, trying to get across to voters his message about the need for economic reforms. 
- This clear cause us problems because we must bring the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities cut to its distribution, but even so I see more and more are supporting the change between adults also - said Milinkevich, referring to that of the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, not consider even retirees, which are the most subsidized by the regime. 
Because of the debt of the country and the growth in the trade deficit, is only a matter of time until the collapse of the social security that "resembles the silence of the cemeteries" - said Milinkevich. 
Russian observers in contrast with the political opposition called for democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people don't believe in words, but in deeds", so that the lack of opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: "From now on more before desayuna of work" 
Never happened in the history of the Palace Chigi that made automatic doors for controlling the entry and exit of staff. 
But from today begins with this measure against anyone and we are going to the pub for a coffee in hours of work. 
This development has been submitted today by the minister of the government here, my Brunetta and by the general secretary of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The doors automáticas- Brunetta told - are a tool for work better, with greater productivity, more and more services" to the minister. 
"Now opens a new season of accountability and transparency. 
This Reformismo is, "underlines once again Brunetta. 
With Palacio Chigi completes the installation in all the buildings of the presidency. 
For Masi "the choice of the automatic doors is also important from a symbolic standpoint." 
It has not found resistance of employees, the secretary general "has been a change shared by the workers and the cooperation of part of the same". 
In short, no more breakfast in hours of work; no more coffee and medialunas. 
Word of Brunetta, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchino at 7 o'clock in the morning is a holy hand". 
During a convention in High school of Public Administration 
Rome, the minister declared that "in three months, the rate of diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, 60 thousand people more at work in a year." 
And he adds that it is necessary to pay effective government 
Italian, "which dynamic wage - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double on the private sector and well above the taso of inflation". 
By now, millions of public employees have joined together to oppose the standards of the decree Brunetta by adhering to the request for the Codacons. 
"While Minister of Public Administration shows the numbers, the absence of causes of disease - writes the association of consumadores - the people of the vague workers' is increasing. 
There are millions effectively in Italy for civil rights and business administration have joined together to declare war on the ilegitimas rules by decree ". 
In particular, in the Tar been respond to the exclusion of economic treatments aggregates for disease due because of service; the extension of the time fajas in which the visits of medical monitoring of patients, and other points in the new provisions dear to the minister. 
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "crucial Prevention" 
Every day, in Italy, happens at work 2500 accidents, die 3 people and 27 permanently are invalid. 
For 2007, the Inail data actually confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200. 
Figures that show the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and almost leads to double the number of deaths in relation to the murder. 
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media information on altars, today the Anmil held in all provinces of Italy the 58 ° national day for the victims of accidents, institutionalised in the second Sunday in October. 
"Worrying information disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days as confirm crucial is the issue of prevention in the work," says the chairman of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, the message sent to the president of the Anmil, national mutilated and disabled Association for the work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state squeeze out its "great appreciation for the ongoing collaborative efforts in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of the injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and awareness of the public". 
"Has been a" enough ', I shared, to tragedies that, because of its size, and raise the clamour of the media and the involvement of the public, the daily reality is proposing dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamic. " 
Napolitano is that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information. 
Particular meaning taken numerous initiatives promoted in school field for a more direct awareness of part of the young people entering the world of work. 
It is a duty to keep the attention of the phenomenon, not slow the alarm on the social scale, implement and improve the legislative rules. 
For its part the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini has stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths are a social emergency absolute, that offends the conscience of each of us and imposes all institutions a determined effort to urgently to end". 
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight andamiento positive, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," has pinpointed the chairman of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"I don't want that, in fact, this" tendency to "translate into less attention, because that is precisely when the alertness that exploits the tragedy. 
"We believe that in general is still done too little for the phenomenon of the accident and the remedy may be put into practice through many actions. 
Are necessary, in our view - has Mercandelli emphasised - more checks and inspections, but also a strong speech on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school ". 
"Serves a further effort - has added - as the media and public awareness. 
But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers on a phenomenon that represents a social emergency ". 
Mercandelli has denounced "the gradual deterioration of the level of supervision subsidiary scheduled for the victims of work" and the "aid drifting towards the system is being conducted in recent years". 
"The aim is to restore the worker the guarantee insurance - has added - because the fate of accidental does not have to rely on the largess prepared by the legislator every time". 
Readers Mp3 under accuses, put at risk the hearing 
Listen to music at high volume for a long time using music portable devices as readers Mp3 can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
As far as the European Commission, which in a communiqué issued in Bruxel quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee of health emerging risk and recently identified (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today. 
"Of this scientific opinion - the note - arises that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listening to music with wireless music weekly portable for more than an hour a day taking the apparatus to high volume risk a missed for the permanent hearing". 
"I am concerned about the fact that a high number of young people often musical portable devices and mobile phones to noise high can unconsciously ruin their ears in hopeless way," says Meglena Kuneva. 
"Of the scientific evidence - remains the responsibility Ue - emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What counts is the awareness of consumadores and pay this information. 
Re we must examine, alongside the existing control systems in the light of these scientific opinion, to be widely effective and step with the new technology. " 
Bruxel had asked Al Scientific Independent Committee of the problem, seeing the great use of musical portable devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that creates. 
"Scientists - concludes the executive Ue - show that is of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with member states and interested parties that measures may take to better protect children and adolescents of exposure to noise from musical portable devices and related equipment". 
Currently, there is a standard European security that limited to 100 because the level of noise of musical portable devices, but concern is growing as the auditory damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to limit of much damage by using solutions as reducing levels and of time of exposure to noise. 
In his view, The Scientific Committee Ue popular that users of musical portable devices they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibeles) music by only 5 hours per week exceed the limit on the maximum noise consented in the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions by periods more sustained, risking a missed for the permanent hearing after a period of five years. 
Means that affects 5-10% of users of such equipment and the number may be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue. 
Rome, Alemanno is the way to the Commission for the future of the capital 
Today is just beginning in March is closed, in June will be the accounts. 
Is this the timetable set by the Municipalidad and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome," which has been established this morning in its new seat behind the Termas of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Marzano Antonio and the other 49 components of the Commission would the main points for Rome. 
Once closed the doors in March, the junta and the communal advice commonly analysis and projects, in way of presenting in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bollo" of the Municipalidad and of its intendente Alemanno Gianni. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political, social and cultural - tends to Alemanno stress - You will provide proposals for the development of Rome in the politically decided, the junta and the municipal council, after they endorsed. 
There is no spare position of roles, but the desire to have a place where a great project for Rome. 
In March the jobs disappear, because this experience should be an end precise time. 
In June, announced the intendente - we will present the strategic plan using the work of the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome ". 
To those who accuse the Commission of unnecessary, given that their opinions are not binding, Alemanno responds: "Everything depends on the work that will be in terms of the Commission and the quality of their proposals. 
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as I am sure in Rome, his contribution will be essential. 
Almost always the policy was shelling in the day-to-day management and in emergencies back in return is warranted. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look beyond and long-term, in a prospective over deep, working with the development of Rome and its future ". 
The intendente of Rome tends to also point out that "this Commission is neither a useless or a truism: is absolutely free, not coastal one euro to the Roman citizens and will involve and argue the best minds that squeeze out the capital". 
For Alemanno, "must be a strategic design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we absolutely need, thinking with spirit of unity to its future". 
A future which, the intendente of Rome "not be limited only to the current confines communal but to look beyond" not only in the view of the future metropolitan city and legal status of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must achieve as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Does Obama? The first president's American. 
He wrote a note American political interests by independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-Americano chairman. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with their decisions reduced the economy and tube relations (as also today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam. " 
The attacks against Obama while on the election date. 
He has written a lady of Miami on a website: "This person is full of ambition. 
Obama has a great side of stone, believes that won the post most of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators! ". 
In reality they are attacks not saying; are attacks clearly of racial nature and not answer the question of voters: will it be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say Obama won and with a good advantage. 
Also in this case there is anyone who speaks from the heart, but not the brain. 
A daily the Mississippi, in the bowels of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote well know who will vote the American patriot. 
A side of the American mentality taken shelter until the last. 
"Whatever they want, we will consider us then to which the cross, either Obama or McCain." 
There are people that weak: if it were to win Obama, we shall of America. 
Things never before those of now, that it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate. 
However despite all these reasons, the winner weapon for democratic is George Bush. 
Asked to 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq. 
Changing America. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent home to kicked in the back. 
In Iraq are 4 500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags. 
Also, Iraq for most has been the weak point of Bush. 
Who will assume the post of George W will have a huge responsibility that achieve. 
Used, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers is time of blackouts. Many are to blame the Internet, "murderous" of the printed paper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been concerned by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mind control for the future. 
If today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future. 
However, the journalists have not openly declared less concern about credibility. 
They are not isolated as once. 
The problem for American journalists is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
In addition to cuts made in the room where the editors working for the newspaper, is a major problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to journalists interviewed, if they are not to the traditional journalism and understands the majority of the public will be substantially reduced. 
A clear but complex pessimism currently dominates the American journalist. 
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that the journalism at national level this following a wrong turn. 
In the local area the group executive is 65%. 
Printed against. 
It is not difficult for journalists to see where will the web. 
The largest publishing houses are opened a gap on the Internet, so many view as the "killer" of the letter printed. 
The "economic pressure" that journalists are warning has risen 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope "that do something good" by the journalism. 
The breaking more great today in the American journalism is between who heads the newspapers - the directors - and journalists working for them. 
The 56% of executives at national level is sure that its journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage low to 23%. 
For some this has to do with the "safety". 
The executives who think of job losses in 3 years are 47% nationally. 
For journalistic staff is 30%. 
What of the "safe" level staff (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of the journalists working with a contract. 
In a nation as the US, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and becomes a matter of "take it or leave it,". 
The directors get almost always good wages, while the writers earn up to 10 billion dollars a month, but the retirement and social insurance. 
For the holidays, the reasoning is complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a number of years. 
But American journalists, admission, are "ill" followed during the year. 
It is all a matter of climate. 
Unipol: TRIBUNAL OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA SE QUEDA EN GROTTAFERRATA 
The chairman of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the authority of the housing Danilo Coppola that had asked to move of their city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola this investigated by bankruptcy in the field of research on the against pact to the escalation Unipol-Bnl. 
In the process of arrest to office, last week, has been home release, transforming it into mandatory residence to Grottaferrata. 
Their lawyer, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the property can go the route of the city of the province into a room in the capital. 
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given voting) would allow him to influence its society and access to the evidence that accuse him. 
The elites in danger 
The phenomenon is already had expressed some days back in the camera's representatives against the plan of salvation of $700 million set in motion by the White House: a significant number of Americans age, and this, most interested to punish Wall Street to save the economy. 
Gives us a confirms the New York Times yesterday informing us that the developing crisis is unraveling the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington and the world of finance, strong, particularly in the states of Central and South. 
The soul, in fact, that has become increasingly with the vote of those who spoke at the beginning. 
This barely mentioned is just one example of the changes, the large mutations, that economic earthquake in announcing: not only in the United States but in all of the West and not only here. 
In the United States and Europe for some time, the crisis seems to function as accelerator phenomena of incubation that with the new climate solidifican and come to light. 
The first of these is the re updating, the extraordinary revival, the double category estado-soberanía in relation to a kind of re nationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, there is a crisis of institutions bancarias- finance itself which, if, strong relations financiarías with the outside world, but especially are much committed more balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state. 
That immediately create a political problem for governing: how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those individuals and those families that are voters. 
The crisis economically is world but is politically and national. 
The political internationalism substantially seems out of play or do not have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union that divided as always between the various interests and the different strategies state does not decide policy in common. 
It is the government of each state that all are awaited a speech, plans of rescue and recovery of new rules and especially the subsidy of funds: from the moment that the court is only the state that has the economic resources and mass of resources financiaros to remedy the situation. 
And also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organisation will never have the same degree. 
This new emphasis that the crisis on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, the greatest importance whenever new development in the economy tends to give a very coligado factor to this element: the territoriality. 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced entering the network technology always more sophisticated, the intangible, while we were convinced that the global finance was already set to dominate the world, we found that our future will change that do the maths increasingly with things incorporeal as water, crops and oil. 
All things, fíjate, can certainly be transported from one place to another land but are linked in any way in a confined space, a territory. 
So who is as sovereign, certainly many more letters regarding who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, oil and without water. 
I get to the second new that but presages a fracture. 
Who says Territory, state government, inevitably says Policy and Leadership. 
In this sense the economic crisis appears to produce two phenomena convergent. 
On the one hand the awareness of the need for a leadership, the request of who will take on the situation. 
On the other hand a wavelength discredit of the existing leadership, sort economic inadequate which with many grey areas. 
And together something more profound and in a disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the whole class leader of the countries of the West in a growing number. 
Always seems more progress, in various places in the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites in boom, the same way of feeling and its culture in the understanding of end, to have the time and to be more surprising to the views of the majority. 
The demand for leadership, in short, subterráneamente feeds a developed but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and of traditional political structures, which are included in a "revolt ’ election or sudden changes of collective whims of recent times, from the conservative end in Austria-Baviera the collapse of social-democrático consensus in Britain, the rebellion by men of American conference against Bush (and layers with the victory of the Right in Italy that it has something to do). 
The impression is that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also its rites, its newspapers, their intellectual accredited, its format would say no, always make it harder to understand and then, what today that is taking shape are profound strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, and potentially tugs in overgrown. 
In view of all this talk of a "rebellion of mass ’ today is exaggerated. 
But the eyes certainly open is not. 
The super glue to walk the walls 
The laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls as the man. 
It is the target of several centres of American research and now a team of four institutes was quite close. 
With a badge of only 2.5 centimeters square the scientists have been able to take on a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall. 
The ESTUDIO - The magazine American Science has reported the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of researchers is changing the existing that use a particular structure, so-called carbon. 
“ The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti ’ explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists have inspired the leg of the gecos, farmhouses of denouncing a landslide that can ensure the animal a grip perfect. 
The test facts on different materials such as glass, teflón and role of lija, have shown that the new badge is ten times more powerful leg of this reptile and at the same time "easily takes off the walls' explains Dai Liming, investigator of the ability of Engineering from the University of Dayton. 
Walk for LAS PAREDES? - "This material could be useful as a badge transitional 'added Dai Liming. 
Layers to walk through the walls exactly as the man spider ’? Strata, but researchers think to use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic equipment, because the carbon are drivers of heat and electricity. 
Other applications might have to do with the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment nothing of superhéroes. 
Another INVESTIGACION - also the University of Berkeley, California, is being devoted to the quest for a mailbox. 
In an article in the journal American Chemicals – Society, students Californians have presented a sticker of micro as naked to car clean of dust during the movement on a surface to always have a perfect grip. 
Drugs: never with exuberance of fruit 
The exuberance of pomelo, the orange and apple juice. 
These drinks, implemented especially in summer because are soft and rich in vitamins, if visiting taken with some drugs is altered its absorption amplifying or declining as the case, the efficiency with serious health consequences. 
To repeat the risk of sucking of fruit are packaged that fresh associated to the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor at the University of Ontario Western in London, that since the 236esimo national meeting of the American Chemicals – Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of exuberance of pomelo, orange and apple to reduce the absorbimiento of some drugs, cancelling the beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The exuberance of pomelo was already been under accuses because it was holding responsible to increase toxic levels some medicinal arrítmicos anti, antibiotics, tranquillizers, antihistamínicos and neurological. 
Farmacos A RIESGOS - The same Italian agency of drug had given the news in a newsletter reports two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that one sprang of this mixture and attention to thing is drunk in the case is taking a drug for example to Diasepam or the Metadone. 
Not SOLO TO POMELO - According experts also the exuberance of orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit the drugs. 
A long list of the principles assets inhibited by the pomelo and other sucking. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milano: "These findings in general has been exposed to the various agencies of international and national drug that possibly provide change information notes. 
That is why there is always read the fine brochures of medicines that are adhered to and if there is something that we are not clear, not impressed, clearly ask the doctor or pharmacist ’ stressed the expert from the agency Ansa. 
The novel of economy to Paul Krugman 
The prize nobel of economy has been allocated to the American Paul Krugman for their studies, their models of trade and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo which teaches at Princeton University and is a note leader writer at the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the great critics of the decisions of the Bush administration as to the economy and foreign policy. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, in those days che quebraba Enron, Krugman was scheduled in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second serious event more crucial than the first, in termines of consequence for the United States. 
A forecast that desencadeno much controversy and that for several years wine reprochada to the economy, but that has now been proved accurate. 
‘ I am surprised and troubled by the memory of scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom have quickly disappeared from the public eye ’ said Krugman to the final of the 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the central European banking, Krugman is a "economist of great value, but also a worker with a" very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft ’ 
It is the day the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity which looks to always attract more users, from the home to the office to the professionals of the public administration, as free alternative to known Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost a year of part of the volunteers developers, of whom their backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is the public with several developments: the screen of welcome and the interface less rude magazine, there are other more consistent, as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the final version standard ISO. 
Attention also updating multi-level operation with the suite Office 2007, Open Office is in degree of open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting some functions specific of some modules as that which will reduce the size of the presentation of PowerPoint, useful for example, to send electronic fun, or the possibility of importing the file PDF in the modulo of grafica drafting, retaining the original aspect of the page. 
Always on this front can create documents "PDF hybrids", that accumulate the grafica typical of format of Adobe with the elements of a spreadsheet or a winemaker of text. 
The partnership is a factor that has received different improvements in the application: the spreadsheet can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of modificas, in the draft texts, each partner has been given a colour in the making for a better recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are also working to bring some functions of OpenOffice the Web (on the cloud, above the clouds), and in the coming weeks should give the final result. 
The version in Italian can be downloaded in the direction at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html and it would add to the English that was in the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as is usually the suite is also available for the operating system Linux. 
To asked can be sent the cd of installation home or work. 
And if the issue of free can be a teaser for the dissemination on houses, is in area business that Open Office the suite proof, the big bet, already can count on several projects in public administration and schools. 
And there are even the realities that offer a service training, consultations and ideal assistance for small and medium-sized firms, in which could open medium-term prospects of business. 
Open Office is composed of five modules main: Writer, for the video writing the had; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces spreadsheet; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the known micro-companies is the programme that is prepared to work within the dates basis; and finally Draw the grafico modulo. 
Target for 2008 is to reach 5 million download, and considering that today we came to nearly 3 million 600 thousand, with the departure of the new version is likely to exceed the target figure.

The rental market for university does not know the crisis. 
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the union of the tenants, renting a room can cost a student EUR 900 in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoles, 600 to Rome. 
"The phenomenon has already taken very serious characteristics to exclude the right to examine a large proportion of young people by the high costs that the family would argue - explains the responsibility of the office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities strong demand completely has distorted the market to the point of starting a process of overall rise until for residents". 
In part that in most cases the offers of rents contain a series of violations: contracts free kind, not recorded, without limit of fees, rents linked. 
For Sunia are necessary extraordinary interventions that, in a review of the taxation, to regulate prices. 
Looking in detail the survey, in Milan, on a bed in area Brianza, approximately serve 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (area Bande Nere) to an average of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in area Victoria). 
In Florence, bed costs on average $350 / 400 euros, a room around 700. 
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, 250 / 280 euros per bed in a double room and 370 to 500 by an individual. 
In Rome in central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you about asking EUR 600 for an individual bedroom and 450 for a bed in a double room. 
Only values slightly more low (550 euros per individual room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
Is economy only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina zone, Centocelle and nearby. 
In Naples on a bed you serve 300 / 450 euros, for a room spent from 400 to 600 euros, with prices running high in the Policlínico areas, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari by a bed you serve 250 / 350 euro, at least 350 by an individual. 
In cities more girls prices are running low on termines absolute, but has a greater say in the economy of the city. 
In the cities and in Perugia-Assisi, where the phenomenon of the rents to students and outside it is more often, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25 / 30% of royalties to foreign students to the Italians. 
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the city cancelled the historical 
Film history rooms closed in the Multiplex. 
"A town cinema halls in blind city, is as a face no eyes". 
The image of the director Tornatore Giuseppe Zahra with effectively what is happening in the large urban Italians centres and also in the cities of the province. 
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, that with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and subsequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in central areas of the city, is an inevitable and event with all the characteristics of a genuine cultural crime. 
Almost disappear are always historic sites, full of memory, "it is as if were a friend, a well-known with which it shared a plot of ground and much emotion ’, Observa the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the great prize of jury to Cannes, which had the poetry of a cinema of province and nostalgia for how to live the cinema that lost perhaps forever. 
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, clear: in the past five years have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay for the most part are sobretodos the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions most suffered by closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, then Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its demise is the avenimiento of multiplex, are own these three Italian regions that have been registering the largest number of new cinemas meticones: 195 screens on Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
‘ The Italian financial year has been irrationally developed ’ Paolo observes Protti, chairman of Anec, "it would be useful to building new structures but would be needed to ensure the continuation of those existing, because when a room of town closed, not all frecuentadores are prepared to be transferred to the meticones. 
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt is about $10 million. 
It is shameful for ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist. 
To keep the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million per year. ' 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that concerned about the closures, decided repaired with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema monkey room is in the historic centre in the periphery. 
Among the rules there are mediated of tax facilitation for the managers and benefits to the public in termines: viewers will be able to enter the area of traffic limited and will have special charges for parking. 
"It's an initiative that I like ” Giuseppe observes Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting on other measures. 
It is true, that contrasts the extra power from the meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the sound quality and image because the public today is more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is an issue for me was always important: the closure of the film Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema," thoughts from 10 years ago. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when step ahead at Rialto or the Quirinale of path already Nazionali closed, where I have lived through so many emotions shared, not to see the ennegrecidos posters by the dust, I turn to the other side ’. 
Bond between policy and ndrangheta, has been arrested and the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of community for stakeholders to the cosca Piromalli." 
Are heavy the acusas that the magistrates of the anti-Mafia of Calabria they intendente and the deputy intendente of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosary Schiavone, and the intendente of Rosarno Martelli Carlo, arrested this morning by Mafia association. 
Also Gioacchino arrested Piromalli, the mediator old man between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, opposite number of boss, condemned by association criminal mafia and to compensate 10 million. 
"Regardless of any legal and moral standard, and common sense," write the attorneys, the two local authorities had expressed the will to pay the lawyer Piromalli. 
"Would have been allowed to the Mafia family - write the judges - officially enter the inner district of facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration". 
The chairman of the regional junta calabrés Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organised life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the Mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable. 
But there are so many local politicians to resist the pressure of the ndrangheta, heroes who stays clean ". 
The arrested this morning are added to those last July after that the police had announced the court of heads of the Mafia family Piromalli. 
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, as in 1991 and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been solevados of contract to administer the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendente, of Udc the moment of dissolution, after the balotaje to May 2006, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition.

Call in the deputy interior minister that at that time was Programme Minniti, by accusing it of having organised by a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explained that Piromalli until had come to call the draft of the A3. 
Of the ambiéntales interceptions to Dal Torrione, write the judges, emerging "the availability to the demands of an employer, a representative of a very close group the clan Piromalli, uniformando the elections of public administration on the interests of the mafia families". 
When the energy from waves, falling to the stage the large 
It is a source wiped out that holds more than 70% of the surface of the planet and are now discovering, the world's big companies of energy. 
Waves, currents, tides are new renewable sources on which are large and Chevron. 
The possibility of raising energy of movements in the sea are looking for a hundred years and in the 1970s with the first oil crisis, research into high gear. 
When the price of oil under, in 1980, the idea of taking the marine energy was removed, but now that the cases of environment and the new increase oil give impetus to the sector. 
The World Council Energy (WEC) of London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of waves of the sea. 
That is double the now produced by nuclear plant. 
And would the tides and currents. 
Giants to the attack. 
The first company to bet on the marine energy has been Enersis, that the 2005 has sealed an agreement to build a breast in northern Portugal. 
When the intention was announced it was a revolutionary step. 
Two years of distance to bet on the marine energy are always more and between these companies that have always voted for the electricity. 
"Chevron is looking at the technology on the ocean energy - has declared the spokesman of a company associated with has the oil American idol the newspaper economic Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us". 
The cooperation in question is on a permit from the committee for the American energy, for a project to exploit the energy in Alaska. 
It is a very important signal, since in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has put in place a plan for new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Facility Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy that comes from the sea, the total spent so far, although not detailed show an interest in. 
Technology to develop. 
The experts speak of a technology at the beginning, because the energy than there are doubts that has a huge environmental impact. 
By now the shocks as those Portuguese or the Scottish are small and seem not create big problems. 
To produce energy to large-scale, to use a technology with a greater environmental impact. 
And the options are several: Facility Power, for example, uses a system of boas united between them. 
The force of the waves, which makes the boas to becomes hydraulic pressure with percussion and cylinders at the home of the same. 
The pressure is turning a diamond-studded which in turn feeds a generator. 
Electricity is sent to the coast through undersea cables. 
By now have four breast of this kind of development, the only until the federal approval, part of the energy, could be taken to to a military installation. 
Verdant Power, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking, using underwater turbines in the East River from New York. 
The movement of water when tides, turning the paletas of turbines, creating a turntable movement that feeds the generator. 
Verdant has said that has a long list of clients to await the necessary authorisations for use energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest in the Institute for the development of the electrical energy, merita at this moment the potential of the tides. 
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more preventable that the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
It is especially on the power of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together to others which are getting closer to the coast, have invested 7 million dollars in 2008 and planned a investment 35 million in 2009.
