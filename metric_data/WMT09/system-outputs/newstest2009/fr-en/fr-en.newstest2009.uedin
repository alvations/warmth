In terms of trade, the stock of Prague bascula in the negative 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the stock of Prague réctifia its losses. 
The dealings with the actions ČEZ reached almost half the usual daily exchanges. 
On Tuesday, at the beginning of trade, the stock of Prague renoua with the fall of the eve, when it lost nearly six percent. 
This time, the reduction is due to the fall of the Wall Street. 
The reaction of the market with the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives, who refused to adopt the stabilization of the US financial sector, is visible at home. 
Fall actions in Asia 
Asian stock exchanges lived on Tuesday a dramatic decline, even if the indices succeeded, during the day, to remove some of the losses. 
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong's stock lost four percent during the exchange, but later, he effaça part of losses and cut down to around 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng index China Enterprises Chinese action following the movement of the Hong Kong stock lost 3.8 percent, markets are closed to Shanghai. 
The actions of the Sydney stock lost more than five percent, but ultimately it manages to reduce the losses to 4.3%. 
According to its Index, the stock of Taiwan lost 3.6 percent. 
"The hesitation about action to rescue the US financial markets affect the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the Monetary Institute of Hong Kong. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
The interest rates in Hong Kong the same level as in the US. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to supporting the financial system. 
Otherwise, we risk that other countries are suffering the effects. 
The bloodbath of US actions 
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system, to which it would have had to spend up to $700 billion (nearly 12 bilions of Kč). 
Legislators renièrent and supports the call for the project of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the economy as a whole. 
The US stocks lived, on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indicators of actions were the largest drop in the last 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall of such magnitude for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost during the vote, but when it became apparent that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
Congress céda: The US government can inject $700 billion in banks 
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader agreement form of financial support for the US financial system. 
It will be put to the vote early next week. 
American legislators effectuèrent a turning point in the negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid amounting to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion kronor), given the US financial system. 
The success is not so sure. 
Indeed, to publish the final version of the bill and put it to the vote, the Congressmans must finish a number of details of the agreement. 
The support of the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
On Sunday, said at the Reuters news agency Barney Frank, the chairman of the committee on banking and financial regulation of the House. 
According to the sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should now be put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
However, given the complexity of the mechanism by which aid to the markets can be effective, will follow a "disappointment". 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have achieved a great progress. 
We have solved our views on the form that should be the package of measures to stabilise the market, "assigned to the Agency Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to it, the final vote could be made as early as Sunday. 
In the night of Saturday, representatives of legislators rencontrèrent US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in order to give the final form of the government. 
It should buy, with the companies sell real estate assets financial companies, resulting in huge losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are on the verge of agreeing on a plan which will work and must be, too, effective on the market. 
We must continue this recovery plan of markets, but I believe that we are, "said Paulson. 
A signal to the Asian trade 
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on the markets of actions which fall. 
According to the évadiez Democrat Senator Harry Reid, legislators are so that Congress could reach a final agreement by Sunday. 
They want to calm investors and before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could influence the exchange Monday. 
However, for the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when both Houses of Congress comes out to vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to be blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem. 
Legislators are hoping that it will be adopted in the coming days. 
However, the law will have too many changes. 
The total amount of aid of the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first $350 billion, as the President George Bush, must be available as soon as possible. 
But, if Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the opportunity to block the granting of the remaining amount in two stages: Firstly, an additional $100 billion, then, finally, 350 billion dollars. 
Mr Bush salua progress in the negotiations. 
Although the President can put its veto to this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it in a minority. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the programme, which was to obtain money to buy bad mortgage securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
"All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed to a vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "Republican Senator Judd Gregg identified. 
The US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
The golden parachutes limitation 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributing against losses, the agreement of tax relief, the conduct of the plan on the axis of time. 
The new law also provides to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of companies participating in the programme and it sets up a committee, which will hold the monitoring of funds. 
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement which will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also includes aid for property owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new advance in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the instalments debtors and allowing them to keep their homes. 
Marek: A psychological 
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult. 
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets to problems. 
This will be crucial to decide on the distribution of losses in the financial sector and the government, "said Marek, this week, the server iHNed.cz. 
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not so important that it. 
"It is much more important than the congressmans to agree, from this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote as soon as possible. 
This psychological importance of the agreement, with the adoption of the plan, the most important thing at the moment, "Marek stressed. 
A fight taken to the extreme: MP3 players against the mobile. 
There you conseillera, how can choose 
While almost all portable MP3 files can read, any MP3 player knows telephone. 
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Nonetheless, there are plenty of reasons to get an independent reader. 
The choice depends entirely on the way to use and the demands of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy a house for the gramophone high-end expensive to implement the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, to such products are on record musical chloride, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen. 
However, if your shelves records vinyles crowded, with the art rock, jazz or blues music, some hope at least likely to such a gramophone. 
It is the music for the movement, namely music high-pressure, to say a simplified music in the MP3. 
Here, too, there are groups on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it would be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would find it hard to sustain the headphones bought for twenty kronor in the market. 
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is large. 
The battery life is also decisive 
Some readers of high-end music are capable of much more than a simple reading of music, but it is unknown functions, of course, the majority of mobile. 
There is also no universal current apparatus that the telephone. 
Has the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and films, to make them, he has a camera of varied quality and can, for example, to serve. 
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and communicateurs, you have in your pocket a small computer. 
Given that no cold storage knows burn meat and that no television pictures will, we are almost a miracle. 
However, the universal nature of mobile is not without problems. 
The number of jobs that you use is high in the meantime between two rechargements will be reduced. 
And the reading of the music is one of the most important energy goinfres. 
There are few mobile who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is much lower. 
In this respect, the readers of music (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient. 
In the case of cheap mobile, they do not play music for a few hours. 
Moreover, if it is to call from time to time, procurez-vous, to be sure, a second recharge for the work - this is the case for the more expensive. 
There should be no problem for MP3 players, which are able, following a reloading, a continuing operation of at least 9 p.m., including the less productive. 
Another problem arises when the registration of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, a limited proportion of aircraft has a universal connecteur USB, as not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
It is, of course, make music directly on the map memory, but little card readers can go without reduction, given the small scale of memory used in the mobile. 
As far as readers, you do need, except (iPod), no software. 
It is enough to meet, through the connecteur USB, the apparatus of music from the computer. 
Most of the mobile and readers will create a library media themselves classed under the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or even after the judgment of the user. 
Some things do not show that an index has a structure of tree, in the manner of the Explorer of Windows, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the smart phones work with system). 
Readers are easier to manipulate, the mobile have more know-how 
In the choice of a specific apparatus, intéressez-vous mainly to the life of the accumulateur, memory, quality and type out of its and, of course, to the ease of the contract. 
If the music is for you, the background noise and if today you will listen for a limited period, for example by taking the trams, you need only read the mobile any MP3. 
Virtually all mobile are today able. 
You are not obliged to do too much attention to the music formats mobile or the reader is able to read. 
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music which will come up to you will precisely this format. 
It is one of the most widespread formats and to hand him, the vast majority of aircraft can also read music from WMA format. 
The PCA (format used by the company and its Apple iPods), is less often. 
High-end mobile phones can also, for example, the purchase of online music. 
It is enough to visit, since the mobile phone, web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier) counterparts and buy the song or album in question. 
This service alone should be a compelling reason to buy a mobile music. 
The supply of operators is unfortunately wretched and it is limited, in most cases, the radio tubes quickly facts. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
However, it is generally believed that this way to buy music (either by GSM, Internet, even by the wireless Internet) dominates the music industry in the future. 
Most people are always mobile them on itself. 
Has whenever you want to listen to something, you only have to get out of your pocket, mobile, while you forgot your MP3 player at home. 
However, it is also important if you always on the headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated bodies that have virtually all mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players. 
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their prices. 
The least expensive is normally less than three thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand kroner, it can be a very nice walkman. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary headphones. 
The price of the best telephones and better equipped, with an entry for headphones, no more than 15 000. 
Readers, by contrast, have the advantage of having a command easy. 
No matter who is really to ensure the most rudimentary readers command - who do not necessarily correspond to cheaper (see our choice). 
A minimum of functions, and the resemblance to the command post with a pot, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet branché by chance, followed by a bill of transmission of data. 
What device choose 
Even the least expensive mobile (and the Vodafone 527) have generally a slot for memory cards exchangeable (the type M2, microSD, and so on). 
Even taking into account the additional purchases of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kronor. 
But made attention. 
The basic models support in principle that the cards with a maximum capacity of 2 UK. 
Only the more expensive fare even with maps memory of 8 UK. 
If you have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a creative, a Sony, Samsung, a Emgeton, or even a iriver. 
According to the capacity (Max. 2 UK), you do not need to spend more than 1 100 kronor. 
If you are part of the auditors more demanding, opt instead of specialised mobiles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung). 
These appliances are filled independent control test for MP3, and it is the ease of the contract is closer to that of an independent MP3 player. 
Sony Ericsson, the mobile number walkman have the same menu user of MP3 players sold separately, is one that has gone furthest in this area. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 UK) and a life of the accumulateur (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is guaranteed by an MP3 player produced by a mentioned above. 
A first virtual operator will gain the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps it 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators proposing practically the same services that their partners in western Europe. 
Despite this, there is surely something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will not fail for a long time. 
We have already mentioned repeatedly on Mobil.cz the fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The Czech ČTÚ Telecommunications (The Office), which has said that the price of a text message was higher than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed. 
So, following the latest step by the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation could happen - the text-messaging from abroad will be for some customers Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really get into the fight. 
It may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and penetration which far exceeds 100%. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez. 
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Office telecommunications (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly declared that the Czech Republic there is more room for another operator, crowd with operators. 
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has apparently not much chance (incidentally, now, it is difficult to find the frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market, which has led to a substantial reduction in prices, which must, therefore, respond to the traditional operators. 
However, even before the entry of trouble-fêtes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, the voice similar to those that we have had today we hear in Britain. 
However, it is clear that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success. 
We are not obliged to go looking too far to find examples. 
In February we had informed the launch, in Poland, the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In six months, the operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country. 
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group pentaBDE, which owns the U: Fon in Tchèquie. 
The advantage of virtual operators having the opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group. 
For that their operation to be effective, they need much less customers a classic operator. 
They are, in fact, without the costs of construction, operation and mobile network is relatively high. 
That is how in the world, the virtual operators are emerging as operators at low cost, they propose calls and text messages, which is often matched by a limited supply of services. 
For example, Tesco Mobile proposes, in Britain, SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland, focusing on an unusual target group can also be a good shot of advertising. 
Indeed, the operator is specifically for men. 
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator who and which they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk at home. 
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman of Vodafone, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which is based on the virtual operators. 
The more that it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say 
However, it seems almost sure whether there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. 
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success, but in the Czech Republic negotiations are not very promotrices. 
The launch of Mobilking will actually take place in other countries in our region, "said in a telephone holds for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the financial group pentaBDE. 
It has thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to a potential competitor can occur. 
The group GTS Novera, which would thus take a step back to become a real competitor Telefonika in the field of customers, does not hide, long enough, his intention to launch a virtual mobile operator. 
"We have much to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already led the negotiations on this possibility several times with the entire Czech mobile operators. 
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, "said the spokesman Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is therefore perhaps promising. 
According to the unofficial information, it seems that perhaps we could see the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by a total silence. 
"At this moment, we do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific. 
For the moment, no matter with a serious and complex project in this area has contacted, "has mentioned Vlastimil Sršeň press department Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz. 
Other operators will also refer to the nature of the Czech market. 
The spokesman of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have not seen for the moment of project viable and bilaterally advantageous, which could serve as a basis." 
And strong-competition: "It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator T-Mobile network in the by the end of the year. 
To operate in a short space of time, we should have a specific agreement now. " 
Vodafone heads rather its attention on the performance of requests for its own 3G licence. 
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of costs and infrastructure. 
That is what we, means the most contributions from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field, the discovery of a partner to put in place a common network for mobile Internet. " 
The authorities responsible: In line with the operators 
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and a reduction of their benefit. 
So what good to facilitate the advent of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, operators can be as fair as larrons. The victims accompanying the creation of the U: Fon witness also. 
The greater pressure on the apparent ČTÚ, the creation of the U: Fon, has been that exerted by T-Mobile society. 
In testimony of the information available to the public learned from ČTÚ websites. 
Yet today, the U: Fon is ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová said on this subject: "Competition in the mobile market was, moreover, recently intensified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of a player would cause further, and especially its services, tough requirements. " 
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulatory agencies is disconcerting. 
It is not just about the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, does not, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
It is exclusively to the Office for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, it took, faced with this problem, its position typical. 
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question on the location of the necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement has not been reached at the moment, because the supply of potential involved do not a priori enough interest in the traditional operators, "said in reply to our question Kristián Department Chalupa ÚOHS's external relations. 
A declaration and does not would surprise from representatives of operators. 
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between different also take care to ensure that no one is taking advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is confusing. 
As Kristián Chalupa adds: 'Abroad, where the virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry on the market has contributed to falling prices for mobile telephone services. " 
However, pressure in the direction of a functioning market honest and lower prices does not seem to be part of the interests of the ÚOHS. 
What is shocking is the chimes almost touching three mobile operators, due to their reactions. 
The question, if it is really a chance, arises naturally. 
Similarly, the price of petrol strictly equal to all the service is surement by chance and a hard struggle of competition. 
"The office has not responded to this subject, signs of a anticompétitif behavior, it has no reason to intervene in one way or another. 
None of the operators is dominant position, therefore no more relevant responsibility for its behaviour on the market. 
The tools to the opening of the mobile market virtual operators are probably even in telecommunications regulator, "said in his statement Chaloupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets ČTÚ that telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in the market. 
However, some experts the right offer an alternative view: For the creation of a virtual operator is possible, we must achieve, each time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
That is how it is necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of its activities. 
However, even without admit this argument, it should be at least three ÚOHS worrying for the mobile operators are clearly in a similar way. 
However, the complaints many interested (including Novera GTS society, already mentioned) show that they have, in the negotiations with all the operators of similar constraints. 
To shoulder the responsibility on the ČTÚ is a familiar enough in communications, whereby the ÚOHS is washing its hands of the matter. 
We have already seen this kind of attitude in many similar cases. 
It did not manage to get into the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, adopted recently, an extension of the powers of ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement of the situation. 
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS are very well aware of this, but their interests are apparently. 
When no one watches, it can walk 
That said, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, mobile networks in the Czech Republic, remains unnoticed. 
It is companies publishing their own list prices for mobile telephone services, but these are public, in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of the multi-level marketing deals firms. 
Particularisés mobile telephone services are proposed by, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others. 
The price lists of these firms are generally to elected representatives. 
The wave of a magic wand, consists in the fact that the company made before the operator is a classic customer company, which commands a great deal of SIM cards. 
As a customer, she gets the price (and other) special. 
The problem is that the conditions of all the Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale. 
"If it is true that you mention, it could be a violation of contractual conditions that we look and which could lead to a ruling of cooperation with the company in question," replied to my question on this issue Martina Kemrová. 
However, it is very unlikely that a response to such an activity has failed up to the leaders of the mobile operators. 
Particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned it may be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, is against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these firms are just their profits, and, at the same time, as opposed to virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav Čepický indicates the potential problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by only a small percentage of customers. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phones is not recorded on their behalf, so they cannot be fully, in the way of ordinary customers mobile operators. " 
However, it is precisely that would seem strange to ČTÚ. 
Moreover, there is another question the ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators to turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It should be added that the ÚOHS have fairly broad powers to disclose such activity, and if he does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, denying the contractual conditions. 
When we will not be the most expensive 
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has made a significant reduction in the price of services. 
However, almost in all the countries where appeared of virtual operators, the traditional operators are efforçaient, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by recent were virtually the same - a market too little or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
However, it is precisely here that have occurred in the developed countries, the regulators, who had not the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers. 
As well as formal measures that by an informal pressure, they were finally achieve the creation of a virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators to deal with this issue to a hot potato which are disposed of in the passing of a target. 
Following the experience that we have, we cannot shake off the impression that the confusion in their skills in these cases more than beneficial. 
But we must not give up so easily. 
If the true background information and a virtual operator will soon be home, the Czech mobile market may resumes in movement. 
If one of operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) other interested. 
And we continue to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Well the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech citizenship, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek formally presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?). 
The anthem has again been recorded by the band of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a female or male solo song, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version. 
The song is guaranteed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Krček Hašek Otakar Jeremiáš and are the authors of the anthem arrangements. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
The Czech national song Bělohlávek as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As he had already left before the Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), it has chosen to the interpretation of versions solo singers with voices young and representative, which are marked and appreciated. 
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care to ensure that the two singers, along with the choir, have a good proverb, so that we understand the words they better simultaneous way," he said. 
The Czech national anthem will, next year, his 175è anniversary. 
The song Kde domov můj retentit for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the theatre states) in Fidlovačka (kermesse of savetiers), Czech original piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music Škroup František. 
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriate. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first breath became an integral part of the national anthem. 
It demeura one of the seven national symbols, even after the creation of the Czech Republic. 
How sounds the "new" anthem 
The transport (MHD) pragois introduce, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system 
On 1 October 2008 will be enshrined in the history of the Agency (podnik Pražský Dopravní pragoise Transport) as the date on which will rise in the metro, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of writing a ticket on paper, will be in their pockets an electronic coupon. 
Now, it is accessible for nearly a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card. 
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (which will apply from 1 January 2009), and both the register on their smart card information points and the offices of the Agency (podnik Dopravní transport), located in the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
As of yesterday, there is also the option to buy the Internet voucher on the web pages of Dopravní podnik: Www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred people profitèrent of service during the morning. 
Those who will begin to use the online shop can forget definitively the counters in the subway stations, where they were awaiting trodden hitherto in long lines in order to obtain tickets on paper. 
Indeed, they will buy their coupon by Internet and we will see on their card Opencard in a municipal libraries Městská knihovna (13). 
"In these points of contact, there are available to passengers a one-stop shop with trained staff, which will help those concerned with the purchase by the Internet and, furthermore, will the coupon that they have bought on their card," said the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný.

What are these distributors? 
They are red, bring to the ticket composter machinery and passengers have perhaps already noted in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be 80," who added Opatrný. 
An automaton will monitor the coupon to the place of the driver 
The vending machines which will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is enough to introduce the Opencard smart card and the coupon bought earlier will make itself on the map. 
The electronic voucher are valid from tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.

"In trains integrated into Pražská integrovaná doprava (Transport included in Prague), the inspectors are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the validity of avoiding temporary and zoning," said the control of tickets Filip Drápal Ropid organisation, which defines the working hours of transport pragois. 
Buses are equipped with périurbains card readers integrated into the till the driver. 
At the boarding it is necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but it must also put the Opencard mentioned on the side of the box. 
That is how the driver voucher the validity of control. 
"If the passenger would need to verify the validity of voucher registered, nothing is as simple as asking this information to the driver," compléta Drápal. 
Passengers who do not take the bus périurbains and does not recall the date when it expires the validity of their coupon, can join in new machines, originally used to record the voucher on the map. 
It is, on the screen of the apparatus, that will make the information on the validity of the document. 
The Sudeten demanding a referendum in the USA 
The Sudeten Germans were Šumava in 1945 to be included in the US. 
This stems from a letter filed in the collections of the Library Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The scientific Southern Bohemian). 
If we cannot be part of The Germany or Austria, we want at least live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of so-called Sudeten Germans were addressed to the President of the United States with such a desire. 
This is between a letter preserved in a private settles, which is now lodged in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
Germans of Český Krumlov pray in the letter, the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (region of forest in Southern Bohemia), annexed by Hitler in Munich Agreement - should be returned to Czechoslovakia. 
"We understand the situation and want to be absolutely sure that the words and statements that American troops are on the German territory not oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says in the letter, signed "Persons, which the fate of the Šumava dear to my heart." 
Given that supporting Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - with the Czech national character - that of brutality, attitude without respects, lack of understanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter calling the American President to take in its hands protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever. 
"We cannot believe that you would give the territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and destroyed the minorities and which has not contributed to the Allies' victory without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," wrote in the letter. 
The reason supposed to which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge "Czech oppressors." 
If the US president doubted the Šumava Germans, it would have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if they wanted to be part of the US, or live under the patronage of the United States. 
Although the text contained in the letter may, in the light of current knowledge of the history of the post-war period, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
While the Czech Germans should at least consider that the question of their expulsion of the Republic will arise, very few of them are avouaient such a possibility. 
Some expected that the US and Britain would get for the Sudeten some sort of autonomy. 
Others believed that they would simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The Austrian famous journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice confirms this. 
During the war, it was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in shipping in the Baltic countries. 
Lorsqu at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the hands of the region's catch Holstein, dozens of Germans were the Czech consult for they learn Czech. 
"They believed that once back home, Czech their would be beneficial," said Chalupa. 
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war was, according to him, that, following the Beneš decrees, it would be expelled from the Republic. 
You do not consider behind both capping budgets! 
An emotional campaign drivers will 
The action road safety the most expensive in the history of the Czech Republic. 
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign that to launch, on Wednesday, the Department of Transport. 
The post of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers of dangerous driving behaviour. 
This campaign will cost EUR 150 million on television, radio, movies, on the Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should discourage drivers of fast driving and drink-driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before starting. 
It is particularly affect the conscience of young drivers, your, pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the spots? 
The personal stories that will attack the emotions. 
Witness also the slogan "bloody" of the campaign. 
You do not consider behind both capping budgets! 
The phrase "You do not consider" ICANN-approved named is included on the registration plate. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "You paieras". 
What must embody that we can pay for a moment of insufficient attention. 
The spots will "haunt" viewers until 2010. 
The Ministry was inspired similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can see commonly images with drastic images of the victims of accidents. 
We believe that this will lead to a decline in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads in the Czech Republic. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of the sugar and blow against drivers 
"What works with drivers, this is the system of sugar and the whip. 
For them, sugar is represented by, for example, to save time, when they grillent a red light. 
The force is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks should be recalled to drivers, "said Martin Kořán, the psychologist transport the hospital Na Homolce. 
That is how we need information campaigns in the press and negative ads, believes the psychologist. 
The signs are pointing out the danger to drivers, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static panel which warns against a danger is established, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will see more," signala Kořán. 
Olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the Israeli provisional government, said for the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including, therefore, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
He made that statement in an interview with the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth Monday. 
"We must reach agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (involved), if not all," said Olmert on a daily basis. 
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israel), because otherwise, peace will not happen," ajouta-t-il. 
It is possible that the deal would East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem, and particularly do not wish to tractors and bulldozers to crush the feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to relinquish parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a solution for the Temple Mount, the holy places and 'historical located within the Old City. 
"Anyone who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
This will not work, "souligna-t-il afterwards. 
The Golan Heights pension 
Olmert also said in favour of the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which is, according to him, a precondition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
However, it would also some efforts by Damascus. 
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan Heights," signala-t-il. 
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up for the Golan Heights. 
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they are giving to terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), the Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "précisa Prime Minister. 
Questions that arise after the accident: The cabin crews in the because they are illegal? 
The law is ignoring them; walk in a long distance is prohibited. 
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of society Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question whether the cabin crews and passengers can during the journey move inside the bus. 
"If you wanted to uphold the law strictly formal and the activities of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The incident in question, during which has died a hôtesse aged 22 years, has apparently been caused by the driver of a lorry which has the path of the bus. 
The girl was at this moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the seat of the most dangerous, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
However, the coach can have an accident, or slow down a steep, also at a time when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What is important is if the coach is under its technical statement seats fitted standing or not. 
If this equipment for places standing is not registered, passengers must remain seated. 
The Student Agency long-distance bus seats are not standing; what has been confirmed by the director of the Aktuálně.cz Jančura Radim company. 
"It is a question that we have dealt with the Ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they have cancelled and we have achieved that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey on condition that they have their own seat, "he unveiled its position. 
The law ignores the steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward, no legal requirement in this role. 
On the other hand, no legal prescription do not the carrier services. 
The law on road transport is only a recipient of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties, "adds more ambiguity spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of the movement of road vehicles, think, on the contrary, that the law is sufficiently the problem. 
"Everything depends on the fact that the coach in its approval was allowed to propose seats. 
Lies with it, "he says. 
The coaches are divided in cities, where there are places standing and a maximum speed limit, inter-urban with the permitted speed up markets and higher and coaches long distances without place standing with the maximum speed the higher and seats fitted with seatbelts. 
As in the plane, said an expert 
Hořín Hašek, an expert on BESIP (security) in road traffic safety in transport, does not see the movement of cabin crews on board as a major problem. 
"At a movement, there is no danger. The situation is comparable to that of service in the aircraft. 
Here, it is not sure when will be turbulence and the air hôtesse can beat your head. " 
"But, in cases where the bus would have resulted in a sharp, the laws of physics would obviously be valid. 
In the same way that in a city bus or a tram. 
The carrier should manage the safety of cabin crews by internal requirements, "he says, and also believe that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not settled. 
Jančura is prepared to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier coach to offer the services of cabin crews. 
In recruitment two hundred. 
Even after the accident, the director do not consider their profession as a profession. 
"But once I have the impression that this is a job at risk, I supprimerai. 
Passengers can get their coffee and newspaper to boarding. 
This would reduce the cost, "he says. 
The concern is the reason that gives the absence of cabin crews in its vehicles, the director of the Asiana Alexi Litvine, which provides, in comparison with S.A., a very small number of lines. 
"We have no cabin crew. We are since the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident, "he said, there is a years, Týden.cz. 
A great tragedy is 
A young hôtesse Plzeň region, who worked for the company for two years, has died in the accident on the line of Naples. 
A Slovenian lorry has probably quité the hard shoulder without using clignotant and it has blocked the road to the coach. 
The driver to try to avoid it by means of a sudden move, but it was almost in its own right. 
Jančura rejects the two seats reserved for the rest of the cabin crews have been sold. 
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to give these places, they are blocked." 
The company account complaint against the driver of the lorry. 
For compensation to the families of the young girl, the agency will not be the judgment of the court, but as far as the financial compensation, it is also on the guilty. 
An amendment of the law? 
Not in view 
A change in the law, which is being drawn up, for more than a year ago by a group of 30 experts from the Department of Transport, could make the movement of cabin crews on the bus. 
"Well, it has not led to any conclusion on this point. 
In fact, it is not interested too the bus, but rather the points system, to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones at the wheel, "said the expert Hořín. 
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of cabin crews as something which would fundamentally undermine the safety of passengers," replied the spokesman Hanzelka, specifying that the control of the safety of buses is under the power of the police and the office for safety at work. 
The hopes of Düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
The big words do not lacking in the letter by the Committee WestLB, director of the house. 
In a union of the bodies of the Financial Institute in Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of financial markets, the Financial Group Sparkasse" could be, according to the letter published Monday. 
WestLB, it would be a "bloc of competence" doubled to a sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive kick-off to other concentrations in the sector of the Länder banks. 
That is what it looks like when a committee Board is to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, injured, is always a strong pressure. 
This is not only the Commission, but also the Federal Authority Surveillance of financial services, it only recently made it clear to the government of the province of Rhenanie Nord-Westfalie of that time is running out in the search for a solution. 
It is, however, a question for some time already, also from Frankfurt - a relationship of some form between the Bank Deka, which is the clients of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Of course, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas said at the presentation of the figures for six months in late August that he had no sense in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, the Helaba or WestLB. 
However the Board of the Deka, which each half is borne by the Länder banks and insurance groups of savings, instructed the Steering Committee of WestLB talks with the common commercial activities in order to. 
It could be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it. 
However, the talks have only begun, said in the financial centre. 
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the largest employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, comes into play when it is a question of consolidation in the sector of the coffers of savings. 
In 2003 we thought for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of Land Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab. 
Nothing is evident from this display ternaire. 
Hardly the plans had they been made public that the government of the province of Hesse said Hellaba's participation in them. 
Subsequently, the two other houses does not rejoignèrent either. 
The Bank of Land Rhineland Palatinate has been linked to the way to the bank of Land Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there were always new negotiations on the reunification of the Deka-Bank with the Länder banks. 
In last place, Günther Merl, chairman of the steering committee of the Hellaba, however, was voted against any commercial strategy of merger with his bank. 
Regardless of this, the feeling is spread that the combination of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election in Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has risen, a union of with the bank BayernLB of Land Bade-Wuttenberg could be achieved at first. 
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure which forced to new mergers would increase the potential escape it. 
In the south, it is now a junior partner, although it has so far better resisted the crisis that the banks of Munich, Stuttgart. 
The Savings and Loan grouping Hesse-Thuringe transfers, with 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, have drawn a barrier at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB. 
The NordLB remain rigour. 
Such thoughts géo-stratégiques does, however, that one of the facets. 
Another aspect is the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl said that the key issue, namely thanks to the future of the business model of the Länder banks should be guaranteed, had not previously determined by the German grouping of savings banks and transfers. 
In the end, a carve-up of WestLB could take place, carving that here is not wanted. 
This is what it says in the letter of the executive committee in place: In any case, would be described as' a comprehensive solution to the establishment. 
In what way it will be tarred with the same brush with the union of bodies with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the festival of beer is also known as the weekend of Italy. 
For Elena, this is the first time for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanied it as a girlfriend, and therefore there is nothing like this, he says. 
Behind them, almost over five litres of beer of the Kaiser, is a bearded well built which shows around 200 visitors to the celebration of beer what sounds profound his incandescent can produce. 
Elena attack by Luca, then the embrace. 
For example, they came up in Verona. 
From there, the road station near the station Puorta Nueva, four buses are starting tonight at 11.45 p.m., destinazione Monaco festa della birra, arrived at 6h30. 
Three buses are reserved primarily for the Italian, in one of the bus travel of brésilens exclusively. 
In a corner of the park, the Latin American closeness already alongside their flag, they have already celebrated last night. 
And noisy, explains Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italian. 
The bus belong to Marco, which is a long coat doubled of fake fur and large pairs of glasses silver eels. 
For five years, they are going to the celebration of beer, already three virées this year alone. 
They go to night, remain the day on the festival, and return to 10.30. 
Night would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the pot Kaiser welcome with a beer, brewed in accordance with the law of Bavarian purity, health insurance and a responsible for the group speaking German - Marco has done a language to Frankfurt. 
Buses are already in the night on the Brennero Autostrada direction '. 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Soon, all is calm in the bus passengers sleep. 
It is better as well, they will still need forces. 
The breaks will be made to Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian vehicle number-plates plates are once again a pause before Munich, on the motorway 8. 
In the morning, the Group of Marco is finally coming to six hours thirty as scheduled on the garage near the place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses throughout Europe are already here. 
Elena, Luca and other assembling, Marco takes a final speech, explains the plan of attack. 
Premièrement: To override the small yellow hat. 
It is written in the beer Day ', in half, and on the web of the travel agent conoscersiviaggiando.it Marco' ". 
Deuxièmement: "When the doors of the beer tent open, there is, shouts Marco in the morning. 
Would run! 'And reserved places at the bottom of the attempts. 
Is not before, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same side, it must share in the Chamber! ' 
The chope, shouts Marco, costing EUR 8.25. 
And do not forget the word! 
The security agents would show that we behave well! 
As you leave your seats, they are parties! ' 
Troisièmement: Is this evening, be back here has ten and a half hours pile! 'Understood? 
And it is, it is party to the celebration of beer. 
On the road, someone able to the trees yellow hats on track, the signs and even in an election poster of a Bavarian People's Party. 
It is to be prepared for the return. 
It is the second weekend of the festival of beer, known as the 'weekend of Italy. 
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50 000 who are underway across the Alps and collapse in the beer stand, 10% of visitors would express came to Italy this weekend. 
The police munichoise is reinforced by seven policemen of the South Tyrol Transit Forum, by search-and-rescue teams for Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which achieves a statistic in countries where the Italians are in the first place before the British (60 speeches) and the Austrian (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions. 
That is particularly appreciated the Italian, it is the attempts of the brewery Hofbräu. 
Nights of sleep for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Finance Minister it was only a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician used the word 'and relatively' glissait that the German banking sector would not be spared by the movements of crisis. 
It is in fact that took place this weekend. 
The Bavarian housing finance Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX, gets a consortium of German banks an appropriation of one billion to protect the turbulence in the markets. 
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans are granted aid of up to EUR 35 billion. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction of what it would thus right. 
The money comes from private banks that of public banks. 
In the background, it is the société-fille Depfa sustaining losses. 
The financial state was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible for the distrust of the markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the supply of liquidity in the bank had been reduced from 95% to 2.37 million euros, the rate of equity capital was also slightly declined 1.6 to 1,45 percent. 
The net and ongoing profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period last year, reached the point, the benefits from the allocation of debt securities and determined and the termination of reserves in the credit transactions had fallen by more than 70% to 5 million euros. 
And it is only thanks to the significant benefits the reimbursement of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as the interest payments, according to the book tax procedures and commercial purchases Konzern for companies that the deficit of the gains of around 16% has been moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financial state had initially badly speculated on building industrial appropriations, who had been filialisés Aareal Bank with the. 
Because what the classic state funding was not sufficiently profitable, the Depfa was then committed more intensively in the infrastructure projects and in the funding of projects in common between state and private investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diverse internationally. 
On the value of the société-fille, the Hypo Real Estate cancellation needs to be on the calculation of the gains and losses of an essential equipment which remains unclear. 
The fact is that the dividends have been reduced. 
Already in 2007, they had been truncated the two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate, since the takeover of the Depfa, a state investor infrastructure and highly important. 
It is more robust than other institutions of the refinancing dependent on the market inter-bancaire because it has no business customers. 
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks, the allocation of funds between banks has once again expressed constant significantly, the banks have accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for around EUR 50 billion - all the appropriations for the Depfa a refinancing short-term way. 
According to a statement of the Hypo Real Estate, the funding of the group is covered with the credit in the medium term and the protection of the influence of financial markets largely out of business. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009. 
The chairman of the executive committee HRE Georg Funke explained in Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to the financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Bank and the establishment of the Surveillance of Federal Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the ability of the Hypo Real on the market is now guaranteed. 
The shareholders and creditors of the bank did more than hoped. 
However, in view of the dynamics and impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
This is not unthinkable that we do not have to resort to the financing to its full extent. 
But the opposite not cannot be ruled out. 
After the fact that the Bank is, according to the latest statistics, even to the gates of insolvency Sunday at the end of the day, this for the least temporarily will not reassure people either. 
The share price has fallen by 75% to 3,30 euros. 
The recent obligations, however, are particularly well. 
While the debts to have barely budged, the second level lies loans. 
The worst affected are especially investment funds from the old société-fille Württemberg Hypo and those of course have a life beyond 2009. 
The obligation of the bank Hypo Real Estate appeared before an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution that has brought the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the Depfa Bank. 
As long as the issuing bodies, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears on time. 
Or will it that no one would hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 months. 
But in the face of a partial nationalisation renouvellés noises, the likelihood that draws near the sureté has now become a mere hope. 
This should give nights of sleep before all creditors in the long term on the decision of whether they should secede from their commitments. 
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line to be a postponement of losses for the coming years on the forthcoming capital gains tax on stock profits from automatically. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the boite to Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years ago, must be present for the first day of the Highschool Tachibana, girls begin to giggle laugh: German is so "kawaii"! 
Est-ce-que it means? 
Sylvana is already this word thanks to Mangas - in his new Log exchanges, it speaks of Japan. 
"The first day of course in Japan. 
That I was excitée est-ce-que. 
Already the path to go to school, I was afraid. 
I live in the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I have of the road alone, fortunately I have not lost. 
The beginning of course does not seem to be as strict as home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils are one after the other from eight hours, until nine hours twenty, a round table starts with Professor, the "home room". 
But before the course begins, it was to me to present. 
I am not the kind of love to talk to people, particularly in a class of 40 pupils. 
As I did not even the standard of school, I have been a long-standing jupe host my mother and a shirt, socks blue ascendant and black leather shoes. 
In this place, I am at the desk, and have tried all vote correctly: '...' Sylvana Sayonara Wo she is - I am Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At that time, I was very pleased to have begun to learn the language there of two years. 
Of the 31 girls have all done whispering, pouffé laugh and signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii". 
I already knew thanks to my mangas. 
It is essential to the survival of vocabulary Japanese ados and means "beautiful, good". 
Then I am quickly slipped in my place. 
The girl beside me has done a great scornful smile, it was that it was an honour that the euro should sit alongside it. 
The rest of the time has been relatively calm, but when the gong was music, I have been beset by the rules. 
Everyone spoke at the time, and I laugh pouffait raises many questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the pause, they have all out their Bento. 
My host mother I was also made this kind of Lunchbox - it is quite another thing that the German sugary snacks miserable. 
I had rice roots, small sausages, a salad of algae and cucumber, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Good, except perhaps the plums salt confites, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only of Japanese school lunches. 
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared itself, and that is prepared very carefully - in the hope of being able to do a bit better knowledge of the boy during the period. 
I have read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could see here. 
"Why Japan in particular?" Asked my friends, when I was told that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo. 
I have always responded: 
"Because it fascinates me," 
In the end, read the mangas, that is what I prefer for years already. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture that is, for a time, I also started to learn the Japanese. 
For me, it was clear that I had to be travel a day. 
Because I have a low for the traditions, customs and traditions. 
And here, it gives them a great deal of importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technology and the latest trends, on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And, as is so well organised, I never felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. " 
Rats also have the sensations 
A rat or a cold turkey fled to the danger, est-ce-que means that it is also fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations. 
But how can we ensure that it is the same thing when it behaves in the same way that we? 
In the online magazine 'Edge ", the contributions are published for several years by renowned scientists. 
Spiegel Online present in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without proof?" 
I believe that animals have the sensations and other states of conscience without me or anyone else has until now been able to prove just as we cannot prove that the other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains are the same configuration. 
When we turn to other species and that we are dealing with the issues of felt or in general to the conscience, we are moving in the difficult terrain because the hardware is not. 
When a rat is in danger, it is the same as many other animals: It is the death, fled or attack. 
Human beings behave in the same way, that is why some scientists deduce a subjective comparable. 
However, I do not believe it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain makes the transposition of our subjective experience the animals difficult. 
One of the aspects associated circuits is almost always on human consciousness include the prefrontal cortex latéral (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in senior management and implementation). 
This vast region is much more developed in humans and other primates and seems to be entirely absent among other people. 
All the less so for these aspects-ci our awareness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the aware of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differentiates even other primates. 
Another significant feature may reside in the linguistic nature of man: A large part of its existence is linked to the language, it often means that its conscience depends on it. 
In this case, we could exclude animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, it certainly influence the, so that the animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, is probably a différencierait in most of our Member of conscience. 
That is why it is so difficult to determine what can be the awareness among other animals. 
If this, internal and subjective, does not measure and, as a result of this hardware, analyse based on our own experience, his comment raises serious problems. 
Most of my developments make reference to the content of experienced aware, but there is another side to the awareness that should be more easily accessible scientifically. 
We could look at the process of conscience of animals, irrespective of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it concentrates more on the nerve correlations of awareness on the mechanisms causals: The two can be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the achievement of the display. 
But what résulte-t-il then for the emotions? 
I concluded that an emotional system such as the fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity. 
What we define as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the defence system located in the brain (or its effects, such as the reactions of the body) owns the memory alive. 
Well observed, emotions are closely related to those areas of the cortex that characterise the primates and especially the rights. 
In subtle degrees of felt, associated with our nature volubile, abound, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiation and categorising states for the blame others. 
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believe that the sensations from activities primitive are born in those areas of the cortex bodily sensations and the waistline, like Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the waistline brain damage. 
As this network is not much changed during the human development, it could in fact part of horizontal sensations. 
A purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict him, but I believe that prove. 
Pankseep argues that what is as fear among the People and in rats is probably also identified as such in both cases: How can still check if rats and the People feel the same thing when they behave alike? 
A cold turkey fled to the danger, but if it feels fear? 
In my view, such behaviour is not enough to prove the experienced similar. 
Of course, the comparison nervous help: Rats and the People have similar brain troncs, the cafards by against does not have a brain. 
But the waistline est-ce-que strokes is at the root of the sensations? 
And even if we could prove it to mankind: How the show in rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I do not know how the show. 
And because their sensations probably differ from all of us (as the consciousness is based on special channels and on the language), I prefer to explore the emotional attitude that the sensations emotional rats. 
In any case, progress on the plan poignent nervous insofar as we weigh up the same thing in rats and man. 
As I do not explores the language and the conscience in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
We could see this as the in the short term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly bumping into things against a wall. 
I am a pragmatic émotionel. 
Michel Platini, the UEFA president: A grace period to Poland and Ukraine 
Mr Iwan Wasjunik Deputy Prime Minister has explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.

The direction of the League of Polish football PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The Committee met on the request of the Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.

The price of tickets and hotels falls 
In the first half of the year 2008, the flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a study, flights would be even reduced to 50%. 
The night flights and hotel would again become advantageous - this is the result of a study of financial services provider of travel and American Express. 
The company has analysed the data reservations of the first half of 2008 and has established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp reduction in profits in the second quarter. 
After that, the hotel market prices have increased over the years, the hotel nights have already cut in many places. 
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of 48 European cities examined yet 6.9% on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined. 
From April to June, the prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year. 
The trend has been clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers were paid 30 to 37% less than a year ago. 
The causes of this résideraient for American Express in the weak dollar rate which has led to a reduction of American tourists travel. " 
The financial markets such as Frankfurt and London would be even more affected by the decline in the price of hotels that industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish city, the price of hotels are with an increase of 26,3%, the highest in Europe. 
Also in terms of prices, the trend is on the increase in the first quarter. 
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene, the economy class passengers pay an average of 7.1% more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very consumers of fuel, even have risen to 29.2 percent. 
From April to June, the economic class ticket prices have fallen by an average of 12.5% compared with the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, the price fluctuations have been much less pronounced. 
In Germany, prices have been falling even more important than in other European countries. 
From January to March, prices have increased by 11.9 percent in the second quarter, they have fallen to 23.6%. 
The German domestic flights have been divided by two in this study. 
The reasons for this fall in prices would be an economic growth slowing, explains the firm. 
The request cèderait ground in a market segment of travel by plane. 
On the other hand, there is a growing pressure of competition in the Treaty "open skies' liberalising air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
Sign of the tense situation is the abolition by airlines non-rentables journeys, as well as the high number of airlines have tabled stock during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe. 
Beating HSV Gladbach 1: 0 
With a view and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a eleven functional. 
Of Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Hard landing for international player Marko Marin. 
The player rentra Gladbach do that late in the game and his shot up against the framework of the goal post. 
His message was made, it was out of his lips persuasive way. 
He knew that he was right. 
"We need this second aim," siffla Hermann Rieger in the corridor of changing rooms of the ring of Hamburg. 
There was little in the changing room, half-time was over and most stale were in their place. 
Rieger has been for almost three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, it enjoys a great reputation as many former players. 
And that is why its request has been received the strategic places. 
The entraineur assistant Cornelius JOL has acquiesé and lifted the boost to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the entraineur head of Hamburg Martin JOL. 
The orders seem to have been similar: And that it comes with this second goal. 
The practice has failed. 
"It was not very nice to see today," better late Marcel Jansen did. 
Bastian Reinhard would "wanted to be more relaxed." 
This 1: 0 (1: 0 at half-time), the team of Hamburg due to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (at the eleventh minute); and the fact that the very low Gladbach players could not do any harm to the weakest players in Hamburg. 
"It was a dirty victory", summed up Marin JOL. 
The SV of Hamburg on Monday will be celebrating its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, fans are hailed themselves, the blue sky above the fray and the provisional league tables on the giant screen that showed their club as first class. 
CA will be a anniversary without genuine celebration. 
"We know take back," said Marcell Jansen. 
It is clear that the interim result of reflects the unpredictable nature of the first League that the domination of its HSV. 
The team with its arrived late committed - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the guardian of purpose Petric like Jansen débauché of FC Bayern - are admittedly slowly, but it is not yet. 
"We need more charm and more dribbles", demanded JOL.

The dark influence on the flight of space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon allows researchers in the confusion: The dark influence on the speed of space probes for so-called manoeuvres gravitationnel support. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the space probe 'Ulysses' flies in space. 
The fact of fuel conductions soon frozen, death cryogène the threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is causing confusion among researchers - the anomaly gravitationnel support. 
The support gravitationnel is a ploy of space probes, for which they receive an additional impetus in the field gravitationnel a celestial body, the Earth, for example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The Cassini-Huygens probe of research américo-européenne used this device, just as the Ulysses solar probe. 
This surprised researchers also for years: Things are not always volants 100 percent of the way it looks in the respective laws of gravity. 
More, irregularities occur at the level of the speed. 
The probes of become faster or slower. 
Until now, physicists could not explain this. 
As the anomaly of the gravitationnel support. 
Some experts feared that the theory of general relativity Albert Einstein, who described the force of attraction of the terms of the curvature of the space, may not be entirely correct. 
The US physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes that Einstein as a hard time and trying to explain the anomaly gravitationnel support with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers will have identified in the universe. 
"The black matters could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also in the vicinity of the earth," he writes. 
The researchers in the area are on the existence of the black only for about ten years. 
It was apparently a soft power, whose effect is being practised on other bodies célestes. 
It is completely invisible, i.e. that it sends nor does not reflect electromagnetic radiation, especially any light visible. 
According to the calculations of scientists, the first black represent a fifth of the mass of the universe.

Abuse of a beau-père "which led to the suicide" 
A court has been told that years of abuse inflicted by its beau-père led a woman to commit suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57ans, Stithians, in Cornwall, has been jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent channels of facts. 
The high court of Truro has referred it linked regularly its belle-fille, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I am responsible for his death." 
The court was told that Miss Randle, aged 34 years, is home implied in the Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007. 
Child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had committed and bandée before the force of sexual acts, while his mother worked at the pub.

Its belle-fille Plymouth out. 
But the court was told that Miss Randle, often volunteer of National Trust, was haunted the abuses that had been imposed twice a week. 
The prosecutor, Ramsey Quaife said in court that friends had been told that Miss Randle, who was a good surfeuse and cyclist, seemed since 2006 "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life." 
In April 2007, the true father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth. 
We believe that it is implied by suffoquant with a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle affronta the father of his daughter who was also, drafted a letter of confession that not as well: "I consider and bandais regularly." 
"I have not abused her sexually. 
"I feel responsible for his death. ' 
Judge Christopher Elwen Trerise said: "You are bizarre as abnormally attached, your victim must surely be terrorized, especially at the age of seven years. 
"This saga which ended with the suicide of the victim. 
And what is even more astonishing is the fact that if it had made this gesture, its history would certainly never ended in court. 
It was: "I stress in particular, such as the describe his father and his mother, the effects of your crime had made during the years on Stéphanie. 
"Without them, it is now a young wife happy, promising, and success." 
Condemnation for loss of official data. 
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten the top secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official secrets Act, has managed to the BBC. 
The rights of the Ministry of Defence was moving when it oublia two highly classified documents on a train from Waterloo. 
The documents are in the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police. 
This is the most serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent. 
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that the episode had many people of Whitehall. 
"They have thought it would have been between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said. 
The employee who cannot be named, is accused of violating Section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause which deals with the protection of information. 
The Crown Prosecution Service officer has suggested that the government should be placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the sensitive nature of his work in the Committee associated with the Secret Services

It has been informed of the decision, on Monday morning and was then shipped to home to a secret location. 
The building societies in the bill B & B. 
The British companies building may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley. 
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of savers 2.6 million of Bradford & Bingleys. 
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building societies. 
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said that it is "annoying" that the companies and their members will have to foot the bill … 
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys will be released. 
But the interests that are at the same time increase, will subsequently charged, each year, the 700 financial companies who collect deposits. 
The Financial Services compensation herd has confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 building societies are included in this list. 
It is annoying that the institutions that have had a prudent behavior … must now pay some of the bills institutions which were much more cautious. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It claims that every society must pay a deposit proportional to the amount that it has, and that the intermediary companies must pay around 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will in 2009, to £450millions. 
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, director-general of the trade committee building societies, told the BBC that this decision it seemed unfair. 
It is "annoying" that the institutions that have had a prudent behavior at the beginning of the housing market, must now pay for the institutions much less cautious. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, the date of the first record. 
"We must examine all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks, to assess the options to adopt to prevent the building societies and their members pay a hefty bill," said Mr Cole. 
The interests of 2009 cover seven months, at the end of September this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, it will pay the interests of the whole year, which could also double. 
Given that the building societies are organizations without shareholder, their member end up paying the bill by higher costs and lower interest rates for savings accounts.

The correspondents have pointed out that the terms of his release are contradictory, because if we allow him to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it should remain free on his return in Bangladesh. 
His lawyers have announced that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court. 
"The Supreme Court has rejected the request of Sheikh Hasina saying that it does not require approval because it had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.

New investigation in the case of American prosecutors. 
The US Attorney-General has appointed a special accusing to check the question of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006. 
It is born of the reporting of the case by the inspector general of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some cabinet officers. 
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and the former Prosecutor General, Alberto Gonzales. 
The survey is based on the theory of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is to political causes. 
The accuser, Nora Dannehy enquêtera now whether the officers interviewed during the inquiry, lied to investigators, obstruant and justice. 
"Of serious accusations of conduct potentially criminal, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General, Glenn Fine, in his report. 
The appointment of a special's ability to compel witnesses to table, was one of its main recommendations. 
The dispute began by radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors made by the US Department of Justice.

About 30 feet of large for 120 of long, it looks like a dusty gone rather than an active highway. 
. There are no signs indicate the streets. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard Atlas. 
However, this street of admirers. 
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury flats on First Street. 
It would repaver extra Place, and create a more smoothly to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers including longstanding neighbors, said to be happy with this shortcuts simply because it is one of the few and oldest of the streets of houses. 
But the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which administers the city streets, has no interest in the bear. 
This month, at a meeting of the owners of neighbourhood committees, the representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal allowing the manufacturer to buy a house. 
But the committee prefers the streets remains in the hands of the city, and has asked to submit a new proposal next month, said Susan Stetzer, the manager of the Committee No 3. 
"There are few areas belonging to the city, and we hope that the city retains extra Place," she said. 
"They could propose to rehabilitate and manage, which incidentally Avalon could make, but we want to maintain public." 
Avalon Bay announced months ago that she wanted repaver the small streets and installing seats, some are also used by a coffee that the manufacturer concédera space. 
The proposal of the potential acquisition was made public in the meeting this month. 
Michele of Milly, the door floor of Avalon Bay, said that although society wants to exploit the streets, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner. 
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker this been abandoned, and make it public," she said, pointing out that this was the city to suggest the sale ". 
Seth Donlin, a floor of the Preservation of real estate, has confirmed that the city wanted to sell the streets, stressing that the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather than the management. 
Compared to its neighbour more colourful, Bowery, extra Place has left a historic footprint. 
Some believe that extra Place bears the name since 1802, when the legacy of the great firm of many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving to hand this small, who stood for abandoned. 
The subsequent entry of CBGB, the punk rock monument closed in 2006, has re open to extra Place; the streets is certainly more famous, thanks to the photograph on the cover of the album of Ramones "'to Russia' 
"It was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of ferrailles, haillons, barriques, posters, leaves and strings. " 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs who had already spoken of evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, were opposed to the idea of selling extra Place, saying that this humble small ownership should be public. 
Others have proclaimed extra Place as a real rareté- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be rotten in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, which led to a blog called Jeremiah' Vanishing New York (sous-titré "The Book of contention: A bitterly nostalgic on A City in the process of extinction") explains the history of the City and extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and defined by the doors of a warehouse in iron and inexistent persiennes, full of newspapers last week that are soaring along the gouttières." 
A few exceptions, the streets has always the same pace. 
A rat short agilement at the bottom of the alleyway, almost a door which were once the CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a clothing store chics. 
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 onces vacuum, based on the side of newspapers that have just been cast. 
A few passers-by said they did not think that rarely in extra Place, and suggested his development. 
Mr field, for his part, said that he thought some under felt the attractiveness of the streets in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "took place in places, wetlands and dégoûtants". 
The Debate Bilingue: Left in the English language. 
In this part of the programme supervision of education, Bruce Fuller and lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates on bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California, and the former head of the department of education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as well as you would think. Why the middle classes must be able to choose their school." 
The attract Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of Obama on education is an interesting example. 
The campaign to Mr Obama stresses that "is Latino and African-American students have less chance of white students diplômer." This is true. 
To combat these differences, the education programme of Mr Obama supports in particular, among many other subjects, "bilingual education efforts" to those who learn English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether its desire to achieve a bilingual education class, which supports the teaching of languages other than English, will not only to eliminate the differences. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school conté's Los Angeles. 
This school students are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many new arrivals, studied English. 
Among the students of CM1, 100% spent the examination of state of maths of 2008, expert level. 
Similarly, almost 93% of students have spent examining anglais-de langues-d' arts 
This unbelievable success was achieved thanks to another ingredient that put forward by Mr Obama. 
On the Sixth Street, in practice, a constant assessment of the capabilities and an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr Obama could copy, brings Linda Mikels, chief of the Sixth Street, this school education has established in the English language "full dumping '. 
The total plunging in English steadily focused on the use of English in education. 
Miss Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, has proclaimed "we have been a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you go without its class, you would have had no chance to identify." 
"This march, takes account," it worked for us " 
Mr Obama, should not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and respond in other schools staffed by a majority of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the National Education for Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its huge support for the bilingual education, obscured the pronostique the answer to Mr Obama. 
Although it is in favour immigrants learn English, Mr Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of the laws in the English language. 
"On the contrary, he said," you must ensure that your child speaks Spanish. 
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it would then have to consider carefully, the models of education that work, rather than the or dismissed as insignificant. 
Sharp fall in oil following the New concerns the world of the Economy 
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan for the financial marches, will be able to revive the economy. 
The crude oil futures have fallen by 7% to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, in sales of this morning. 
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday. 
The past two weeks, the raw materials markets have been buffeted by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Having experienced in July, rising to $145.29 a barrel, prices have dropped to almost $90 a barrel at this month, before rebounding again at the sight of the profound uncertainty in financial markets. 
On Monday, investors are once again concerned with the agreement on the rescue plan, the greatest of history, reached this week ending the leaders of Congress. 
The news has been watered down by the recent concerns that the crisis would be durative. 
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup buys banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday. 
At the same time, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis. 
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that the frenzied negotiations this week ending, concluded with the agreement of rescue "do not seem to have managed to revive the market." 
While the economic situation is détériorasse, the demand for raw materials, oil included, should slow down. 
"The global equity foresight, interest rates and exchange of markets, has become uncertain," wrote analysts at Deutsche Bank in a letter to investors. " 
"We believe that the raw materials will not escape this infection. 
"As regards the raw materials, our concern is the most pressing to understand how far the US virus diffuserait-il generally and in particular, China". 
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the fall in consumption of oil due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore obliged to reduce 20pour%, the price of oil and gas for 2009. 
The celebration of the Second Times Record decisive for the improvement of the Equipe. 
Having spent during the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform jets Shaun Ellis, the defender was thought to have all seen. 
It took the second time, when the jets transformèrent a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I have never seen anything of this kind," said Ellis. 
The second time began after the jets and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under dark clouds. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre has managed to make a happening to Laveranues Coles from 12 yards for a touchdown, precursor to a after noon when their relationship has taken a step forward. 
Favre has found Coles for yet another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell, and the second, 10 seconds of the half. 
"I am not out of my area," Favre said about all its having to Coles. 
"It is a mediocre player" 
"We can communicate extremely well, despite what the people say." 
While Favre and Coles playing the catch, the defence was at the back of the Cardinals quarter, Kurt Warner. 
Darrelle Revis, corner back, has intercepted a lost and 32 yards for the touchdown. 
Eric Smith made another happening and has stopped. 
Linebacker David Bowens left escape the ball because of Warner. 
The last change, the loss of the ball to Bowens, may well be the most charming 
The Cardinals have taken control of ownership in the last 10 seconds, and then the jets have recovered the ball, Jay Feely did a goal of 20 yards taking advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was the best that could be jets at a time. 
"The jets coach, Eric Mangini, who were asked to describe this madness, said," the second or third time? " 
When he said the jets deux- undeniably have missed 21 points in the third temps- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time that the third. 
. "Many points have been marked by little time." 
Gebrselassie based, beyond his world record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, the Ethiopian, has once again proved to be worthy of his title of best long-distance athlete of the century, after breaking his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, making it the first to run 26,2 miles in less 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 of a withdrawal from the race, Gebrselassie has fought with 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, played last year in Berlin. 
Has 35 years, Gebrselassie won the 26ème world record of its successful career during which he has won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, the marathon 1600mètres. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, craignant- can be under the eyes of today - that air pollution is increasing its problems of asthma. 
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin. 
In almost parfaites- time sunny, 48 degrees at the outset, 55 to the arrivée- Gebrselassie won on Sunday, now an impressive a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The runners of runway as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenya, converted into runners, have contributed to the loss of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa earned in Berlin in 2: 06: 05. 
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie said to reporters have suffered the crampes Mollet two weeks before, and have missed training for a week. 
It is obvious that the rest of remained brilliant, but not inexistent. 
"I am so pleased," he said to reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I have called last week, and today, I had my doubts, but in the end, it all went to the better. " 
It was reproché- especially in Kenya, Africa is the Ethiopie- having too orchestrate its races, avoiding the marathon world stars, relying on the hares as if they were in a competition of ideas, and most of the world records that the sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of the capacity for Gebrselassie as a substance. 
Gebrselassie Sunday, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. to middle way. 
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to defy Gebrselassie after the head of the queue were missing. 
A little more than three miles of the arrival, Gebrselassie made its final climb to move away from Kwambai, who came second in 2: 05: 36, improving the best record of five minutes. 
Is Kamathis is third in 2: 07: 48. 
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2: 19: 19. 
Britain's Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
The spring, Mikitenko aged 36 years, has surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
It could participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical badly in the back, but he promised to win in Berlin, improving his third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
It courut making use of a clever strategy, leaving the group of runners Ethiopia and Kenya take a great advantage, then about 18miles excess ½ after. 
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Margasa came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, country's, 18-hour third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a separate City, pride and the hardships of the Black Life 
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet town where are the pride and the complications of the African-American experience. 
"Eatonville, first city black fully to integrate, home Zora Neale Hurston children of this description than it was in 1935, is not so simple to make our days." The town of the five lakes, three short of croquet, 300 skins foncées, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not in prison ". 
It has now become a pilgrimage city 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and ruby Dee came to Zora Festival every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in different ways, the city that it became décrit- tourism thanks to its inclusion in the tourist guide to the Florida published by The Depression- era Federal Writers Project- 'remains a place at hand. 
It is also independent, dignity and privacy than it was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural population in Florida were often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, who we know so little, do not know what he loses. " 
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also referred to an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious in the eyes of the world. 
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, resident for ever and the oldest paroissienne of the city. 
"It must be in line with reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It represents both a historical model of a black power and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a central issue but also an example of a black rural culture sudiste- once scorned, other times acclamée- reminiscent of the birth of American slavery. 
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston. 
It put forward his home city in the world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as "mules and Square" (1935) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the forefront of the Florida transformèrent this city, located just outside of Route 17, a road which runs through the center of the Florida, often forgotten, which in chapter of history and of human tragedy. 
Such a large cash bold in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers of ownership of the former mayor of Eatonville, Mr Joe Clarke, who was divided into several private parties. 
"The road on the left," écrit-elle, you will find the modern white and brown public school, with its gardens and these areas of game well maintained that Howard Miller has always taken care, although it can barely read and write. 
It did also mention the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold all kinds of drinks and everything that can serve the people of transition. 
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, combined with a car Hurston Eatonville analphabétisation but also to the government, the remariage, and sex. 
Of course, Fodor was not as well. 
This was not in fact a portrait that everyone appreciates. 
Zora has described the reality, "said it Dinkins, 90 years, a young girls of Johnson that Hurston was immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who louaient their beauty." 
It was: "Some people have not appreciated." 
We remember always of Hurston as a person and excentrique, which was often after his family, has moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, rappela that Hurston was usual in city without warning, on a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and was of trousers here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes. 
Many residents were fascinated, Mr Franklin told, while many moquaient of it. 
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said. 
But it also adds, in his chair of the patio balançant since that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly called, "it was never too long". 
The death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out of production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although it was once a star of literature, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College of the 1920s, it was buried in a grave, to Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived. 
Has Eatonville, no great celebration, or mark for the general public. 
I do not believe that they have understood the contribution that the world's legacy, "said Valérie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows, "a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Public officials of Orange County wanted to build a motorway in five routes in the city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, street in two ways of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already prompted Interstate 4 to the west of the city. 
The proposal was made while Eatonville healed just a difficult time in its history. 
A forced integration, among other things, has put an end to the isolation relatively rosy community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute about the mixture of races led hatred at the gates of the community. 
"At this time, a gang of young whites were launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Mr Franklin. 
"A woman is even died." 
They followed a pastèque of their car. " 
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the request of the Supreme Court to a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifieuse my race". 
Residents are now that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although in some respects, has weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermines the trust of the young. 
"Black children used to be embrassés- I reminded you embrace our hero for the morning, and the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of it Dinkins and head as head of the protection of the Community of Eatonville, a group not benefit. 
It lasted, ajouta-t-elle, until teachers and students do more to come from the same place. 
"You do not embrasses tone because he is a white teacher blanc- I want to say that there is a cultural dividing line," said Miss Nathiri. 
The civil rights, moreover, have helped to create space for other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the damage, as it, armed with a cheerful confidence own and lines of action such as: "How can deprive the pleasure of my company!" 
This is beyond me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the grave anonymous Hurston and began to try to revive his reputation. 
Five years later, a biography hailed on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, and American cannons réintroduisit. 
The project of the motorway came just when the daughter, the most famous of Eatonville had recovered its appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbours of Hurston regard as a sauveuse. 
The community has begun to hold a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would create the motorway. 
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival after two years, and many back in January, to commemorate. 
After many years, the contée has rejected the proposal of the motorway. 
"The fiasco of the motorway to five ways, extremely quickly, a genuine civic pride," said Miss. Nathiri. 
Boyd Miss summed up the declaring that "Zora saved Eatonville". 
The victory against the motorway project has allowed him to change its own image. 
People non-resident, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who frequently our church depuis1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Historic city is classified Eatonville since 1998. 
The library mono subject (renowned obviously Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in the Florida: Six miles to Orlando, it can at any time is regarded as a back street back in the summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1800's. 
(Today there are 90% of blacks) 
The foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are treated with caution. 
We must ask permission for most of the interviews, and some choses- as the walls of the Old Church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, of black men in the champs- must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a teacher courageous and which has a low for the red heart, have always fear that their island community is not well understood. 
However, given the expansion of the festival Hurston, a certain level of local pride has emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to be regarded as Hurston Eatonville its entire race: Fine, and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse insane and confused that other racial and ethnic groups in America. 
It is true that the civic affection in the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, which provides for a return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or the forces of Police, who need additional forces. 
And even for the young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description. 
"Most of the people who work in this area, will: 'Oh, this city has nothing compared to other" Alondra Kenon said after the church service Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it is a very beautiful city. 
Here in New York, all speak fluent finance. 
Despite all, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan took place far from the giants stand and television screens in Times Square, they do not make that they are in the eye of the storm. 
Never they could not think that in the offices in glass and nest of bee over their tète, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst 'working day at the office "since the fall of 1929. 
The pizza continue to slip on the streets, with their trolleys and their and muffins for meetings matinières. 
The is Latino are always between the residential buildings, as the mules, nearly 50 shirts top-of-the hanged a yoke prepared on its shoulders. 
The office still queuing to buy their sandwich matinier retailers to happen, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h in week. 
I had not felt the crisis despite stories completely pessimists until the following afternoon when I décidai to open a new account of savings. 
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of after noon, because I découvrais to my local bottling JP Morgan Chase, a score of people queuing. 
Not at the tills the cashier or to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but at the door of the customer service, where the usual customers where their checkbooks, tourists were the direction for the shop Macy, and opening up new customers. 
Most of those before me, I apprendrais Starr later, my "banker staff allowed", were all waiting for the same reason that I am. 
In the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, like those of the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money in savings accounts of so-called thrifts (as a society of the building), associations of credit, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries which do that in a state, and that deal with customers and their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt. 
These days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327 syndic has made use of bankruptcy, and while the New Yorkers rentraient at home for the week ending Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, the savings accounts to a value of $440 million désespéramment sought a buyer for the save. 
The Bureau and the employees of shops are before me, afraid of another potentially debacle, have transferred money to a bank that seems to be reliable, is that most of the rescue of Wall Street. 
Some of the New Yorkers have become very familiar in the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a woman in my local supermarket, speaking on the telephone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that has failed, and its meagre CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that it could have to criticise a colleague. 
And Lyn, my uniformed doorman building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the supply of my fruit and vegetables. 
She said to me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the monetary fund market. 
"I have changed, I do not want to take risks." 
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria has swung back to the right. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, who gave up the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the organisation of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday 17 January 2008. 
They are road signs of red mosques wiped out. 
The Police accuses the right-wing extremists have desecrated a Muslim cemetery Austria, the week ending the victory of political parties of the extreme right wing of the general election. 
More than 90 graves have been seriously damaged the cemetery of Traun near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is, according to the police, organised action. 
The offenders have painted on several graves, of Jewish symbols such as the Etoile David; the detectives believe, however, that this could be done to conceal the feeling of hatred of Muslim extremists towards immigrants. 
This accident could be somehow linked to the elections. 
One is the Islamic local Community said to be "deeply shocked" at the news of the desecration, which occurs just religious during the month of Ramadan which is coming to an end. 
Austria think seriously to regain his courage, following its oscillation towards the right during the last parliamentary elections. 
The two right-wing parties that have raflé almost 30% of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign anti- immigration. Some of their slogans were even seen, according to the critics, as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party won more than 18% of the votes, has pursued its campaign against headscarves and under burkas, and has expressed its opposition to the food alaha. 
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam. 
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, saying that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and of Europe. 
Opinion polls and the analyses carried out just after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc of countries, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because concerned about their future in the European Union.

The courts have banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, to cross in France and Spain. 
The sexes have imposed a ban on Glitter six months after it has expressed the authorities who have under control, his intention to go to Spain and France. 
The Police in Kent had given this travel ban last Thursday after having demonstrated the sexes guilt of Glitter for sexual abuse of children.

. Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having served 27 months in prison in Vietnam for abusing two girls, respectively, 10 and 11 years. 
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok where it would have to embark on a flight to London.

Included in the programming of the photograph of Fleming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, more each day," explains the author, which clarifies that "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people '" can be anything but, having seen the pictures, the observer realise that these are not typical images of artists on stage. 
These people photographiées "in the streets" are artists able to pass on stage of passion, sadness, and joy... in exciting the public. 
To capture the moment of personality of these artists it should not make photos on stage. 
They have a personality and a unique character. 
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of moments of personality stars the intoxicating spirit of flamenco. " 
With the festival "song popular Mines," Bauer began in 1997 a long journey for photographing the singers, dancers guitaristes or with a camera to mark. 
These are the portraits, which, thanks to the choice of the camera and hardware, given the photograph. 
The implementation of various means stylistic breaks with the image of the classic side, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco according to Bauer: "Music with changing traditional very roots and surprises us every day." 
It is not the song and dance in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who ogre the public with his art. 
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant in this work that we are now in the gallery El Fotómata. 
The stars of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from around 70 artists photographed. 
The project has turned into a anthologie the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collection of portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer has led to repeat the idea two years ago with the "portraits of old athletes' (" SportARTproject "). 
Although the concepts are different in "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people ', the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people know and can enter their lives for a moment more or less. 
I believe that in the photograph the picture is the most difficult. 
Do you trouves in front of people, of characters that sometimes you do not know, or are you just a few minutes to make a photograph. 
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try that my ideas reality. " 
This collection of portraits of the current intoxicating spirit of flamenco entitled "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people ', is exposed to the Galerie El Fotómata, located in number 20 in the streets of Mata (street parallel to the Peupleraie of Hercules), which will be open until 16 October.

The favourite to win the Nobel Prize for literature has confessed yesterday to the Hay festival Segovia, who is the novel "is a real courage" and that "all shows that it should not write".

The author of "The city and the dogs" was the person most of the third edition of the festival and has fulfilled its contract. 
Vargas Llosa, who won the price of the Hay Festival in the majority of participants, was packed Chamber of the theatre Juan Bravo. 
The host of the Festival, Felix Romeo, was confronted by public fascinated who has not seen the Peruvian for the last time, with a phenomenal memory and with a large dose of humour, has described the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to its desire to read "and" to live new experiences "; how he wrote a very methodical" thanks to the hard work of documentation, correcting and in redrafting a part of the text to face up to its' lack of inspiration "; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire its books. 
The novelist hispano-américain acknowledged that there is no way "to measure and whether books change life." But I refuse to believe that the literature is a pure enjoyment, a short-lived experiment, "said Vargas Llosa, who has said that it" has the effects "and" makes people less similar ", because it has asked the writers' not succumb to the frivolity" and assume their vocation.

"Sangre de Mayo ’, the gamble dared to Garci 
In inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci récrée the famous Battle of Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de Mayo ’, which is the most ambitious film its filmographie with almost EUR 15 million budget.

Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci guarantees to have done with this film "a dream of children through Esperanza Aguirre, who was responsible for three years, to turn a commemorative film for the two hundred years of 2 May Madrid, something that he has always accepted when the story stuck to national historical facts.

But the filmmaker regret not having secured funding for films such as "Captain Alatriste" or "the ghosts of Goya '- more than double that achieved for" Sangre de Mayo ’, because it has not been able to turn a few scenes written in the script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which it has worked for almost all of his career.

Isabelle Bayón puts itself in the skin of the dancer sévillane Tórtola Valencia 
A dancer sévillane will pay tribute to a dancer also sévillane. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a father Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the village of Triana and who at the age of three years will live in London with his family. 
It was a dancer dance free and eastern dancing expert. 
It was an exciting life, pointing to the release of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was a Buddhist and végétarienne plaida and for the abolition of the corset which prevents the free movement of women. 
The life of the woman who has marked the history of leadership in the interwar Europe has fascinated Isabelle Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and it has proposed to interpret the dancer sévillane Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible". 
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate its way of thinking. 
The titles of his dancing reminds me the intoxicating spirit of flamenco. 
Thus, "dance the butterflies' reminded me of a Cuban popular dance to the tune of the snake 'to some tangos. 
His dancing was sensuelle, and they told me that my way of dance was identical to hers, "she says. 
The dramatization was achieved thanks to two remarkable contributions: Miguel Poveda which chantera Isabela again in one of its shows, as it did in "La Puerta abierta"; and that Professor Matilde Corral, who was exceptionally keen to cooperate with the one that was a pupil. 
"Matilde Tórtola transformed in a mature character. 
I am pleased because it has agreed to play a role in my work and it honours. " 
There was also through music composition and guitares of Arriaga Francisco Jesús Torres there, to the pop song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga are Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the breaches of Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the old comrade of this kind of artists who were regarded as divas". 
The play tells also, in a way, the life of the woman who has shown in very remote locations, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, because it was usually in London. 
"I wanted to the back because I believe that these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights his", says Bayón. 
The show will start at 8.30 p.m. theatre Lope of Vega 
The publication of "Journal recently married to a poet," concludes the Triennat 
The presentation of the first edition illustrated the "Journal of a poet recently married in the church of Saint Stephen' is in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez is married with Zenobia out in March, falls within the framework of the activities envisaged by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the" Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón "(2006-2008), held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for literature and their deaths. 
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the revival of the play, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum exhibition and with the migrant "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This peuplier of light," which was inaugurated last May and who, having travelled in the various provinces Andalusian, will go to New York at the International Congress. 
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has bought eight hundred copies of "Journal recently married to a poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the work of an Andalusian poets. 
America less without Paul Newman sorted 
"The time God created perfect people 
Paul Newman was part ". 
This sentence is of the actress Sally field, who has worked with him in 'lack of militia ", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and America, with the idea of striking that Newman is not of this world. 
It took the trouble to get an Oscar 
It was more since 2007. 
Everyone knew that he was ill. 
It has been a hard blow for everyone. 
"Sometimes it feels that exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," began crying Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence". 
No one was afraid of making ourselves ridiculous or exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a period of particular obscure, where the terrorists and the stock markets are afraid, the US is the worst in desperately searching for reasons of dignity. 
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there are human beings that admiration and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda for like Paul Newman. 
It was for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It has been the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the fight drugs created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and the creation of its own brand of organic food. 
This was a victory for a country which took the trouble to set against a suicidal food culture. 
This expansive wave of admiration balayait Hollywood without or the nationalities or passports. 
The latest James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, noted that any James Bond died before him. 
Another Englishman, won an Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the summit of his career. 
The bad boy arrived in Australia, Russell Crowe, dares nominate Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"We have set the bar high," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only today which is trying to break the screen like Paul Newman: By being very honnêt and private life with a serious and further objectives. 
This is not always easy or possible in the jungle of our days. 
But there are those who tries, and Paul Newman is one example. 
After a divorce, he has been married fifty years to Joanne Woodward were, in which it was true even if the opportunities were it not for not to be. 
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have a beef in my fridge?", he used to joke. 
The sky, it is with pride at the meeting of his daughters with its fans on earth, something which is not so usual in America. 
"Among all the major roles he has interpreted, it has never been so proud that a dedicated husband, father in love, the grandfather attentionné and philanthropist" disent-il. 
Madrid in the run-up to the Olympic Games in 2016 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid to organise the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be achieved by 2016. 
But I wonder if we are ready. 
If we take the example of the race yesterday: We are not! 
They call for the race perfect, but I think it was the worst race to which I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, it would be a note éliminatoire. 
But look at all in detail and from the beginning. 
Errors are beginning with the withdrawal of dossards, which requires you to go ahead. 
This is not easy, but if they do you move it would be better than they give you all (including the chip to shop). 
And not well 
They've were going there only to take the dossard (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was that the size of the 'S' jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
We live in a world? 
Est-ce-t-il because of the crisis that they have decided to buy that small shirts with less fabric and suddenly cheaper? 
Eh well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of racing. 
Is the fact that we must go there very soon to withdraw the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and he must leave his backpack. 
The has lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible since 11, 000 people are expected for these races. 
Since there has had a long queue, competitions have begun and we had left our backpack, although once the withdrawal was worse. 
Moreover, the rain has accompanied the expectations of more than 40 minutes in which took place rebellion and barrack of the attacks. 
I believe that around 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, do not even figurerons classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I believe, has not been properly the start. 
Of course, if they were asking me to give an example of the perfect, it did not occur to the idea. 
So I believe that we can still dream to become the host city for the 2016 or. 
Microsoft seeks a virtual (see) 
The conference on the emerging technologies MIT Microsoft has been presented a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of artificial Intelligence with little understanding but able to perform some basic tasks, as called a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to visit the campus of the company) in response to what it was asked during a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "see" can know how many people there are in place, which they are - including remember what they occupy positions - and listen and take the key words of their conversations. 
But the together in groups of conversation 
In the video presentation, the athlete see a third person but she understands that it is not up to the group which is dealing with it, and that it is not part of the company. 
She asked if she is here to visit someone and she said that she will respond in a few moments. 
All this without a blue screen. 
An impressive. 
But, of course, is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which focus, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week we spoke in more than a change of strategy to Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many programmes involved. 
Steve Ballmer, has discovered that if the computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would five times faster. 
This is a discovery since Microsoft, time after time, has not been added to the functions and "perks" to Windows. 
The change of strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its operational system is important but also its software. 
When Google Chrome came on the network, I was one of those who has joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not a workable system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is essential for the hardware and software to understand. 
It is the same function that your wife or your husband when you say something to your mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
It will never but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a truth. 
This week, Ballmer, confirmed this idea. 
People are less and less attention to the operating system but increasingly the Internet browser. 
I turn on the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time to surf the Internet than to go down the drain. 
Has used half the applications provided with the system? 
Can the most is the least. 
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much less than Vista. 
Less cumbersome, months overcrowded, less complex. 
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own online services that they become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need this, indeed, and I would set an example. 
The photo here in this article has been taken earlier this month in the rest rooms reserved for the employees of Microsoft in Redmond. 
On the distributor of drinks, a poster their request to use their own research tool, "Ta research. Our future". 
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to seek information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay has occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or 2010. 
Microsoft will surely start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, is increasingly resembling a computer. 
But the launch of Android being delayed and the iPhone are already on the market, it will cost them dear. 
The awesome Marcel 
Pablo Picasso the assumed on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio bore a diamond is in the blood of Edward Zwick, along with Al Pacino in The godfather 'from Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association gays heavy-handed. 
And if we are to list all its appearances, one could also mention this costaud moustachu in which raise a travelling circus. 
This is not just a swimming male body in cotton, milling and without sleeves. 
The English is known, but there is a wonderful Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the other. 
Firstly, by its name flamboyant, although it is known as the 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport as it takes the name, according to the legend, the boxeur Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
The former Marcel 'differs from the other by its cotton excellent, by its single-sex cut its distinctive logo and by the Belgian flag (barely recognisable) shows that the best-known body have in the neck. 
But attention, because the Belgian brand does not only that the tank tops. 
But it also sweat-shirt, retro Boxer, cashmere cardigans, trousers in cotton, the babies, the mini-shorts... 
Clothes designed for the comfort of his underwear. 
Even if it is a pity the wearing just underwear. 
They have too charm. 
"I would become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me." 
Its enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented to develop its own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality. 
Now the sisters Cruz take seriously their new activity in the way. 
According to Monica, they are not that girls beautiful and famous who lend their names. 
It was here to promote the brand Mango was in Paris at its new headquarters, but also the most important prices in the way that the Spanish house sponsors. 
Monica is warm and timid.

A day very intense but, at the same time, exciting, we expected. 
What is your new collection created for Mango for the fourth season? 
The film industry in the 1950s and 1960s we dazzles and we copy much for our collections. 
I like to walk in town and observe the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I am often. 
Dancer, actress and dessinatrice, you are a woman very versatile: Is it not? 
I believe that, yes, but in the end it joined and these activities have much in common. 
For that I am very small clothes plaisaient me; I désirai go to my grandmother to look in the filing of my tante and to see its clothes. 
It was crazy, almost better than to go to the theme park. 
Secondly, when I became a dancer, I was trying to take care of my way to pay. 
Like many of the dancers dress for the way the tests, to take a look in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the role of actress, when you endosses clothing it is at that point that you've really put the figure in the skin. 
Suddenly, everything is linked. 
You had not long ago 30 years: Was it hard for you? 
At all. 
I feel better than ever, my 30 years I am delighted. 
I think that the woman is more mature, has more experience and appreciate life with fewer problems. 
The biological clock is not afraid. 
I have all the things that I wanted to make for very small and it gave me great pleasure. 
So, think you you become a mother? 
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body wonder and, moreover, I wish to become a young mother; I do not want to lose it. 
With regard to the candidate, I am not as concerned. 
What I will do is to give a great deal of happiness to my son and raise it with a lot of love. 
The film venons-en, you expect the various films that you turned last year. 
This is true, I look forward that they. 
I am a woman from the scene, I am very anxious and worried, I would have now, but of course this is not possible. 
I look forward to ensure the film 'The última hora busca In' and the 'tumba of Cristo. 
Has see what you will … 
There are a few days you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, is it not? 
Do not dîtes! 
I am not mounted on the bridge to the mannequin. 
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known for a long time, to invite me to participate in London a parade of charity for its association in favour of support for women and clothing that we exhibions - I have exhibited two clothes of our collection created for Mango - were auctioned to collect money for the NGOs of Naomi. 
The people that Naomi is one of the heart out. 
They say so much about it, I do know, a lot of things are not true. 
Moreover, if good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She has asked me to go up to a cause if noble, but if she had to make the poirier, I would have done so anyway. 
The important thing is to make life better for women in the developing world. 
The recidivists of drink-driving will have to install the system is' alcolock 
The interior minister wants the driver who had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, has to settle in his vehicle off a system which prevents the vehicle in drunk driving, or if he does not. 
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report by the Minister of State in which this initiative is regarded as a pilot project that will last for one year. 
Its aim is the inclusion of the driver in road of rehabilitation courses. 
The Minister of State for road safety but also the Directorate General of the Road Safety Foundation and the Technological Institute for Security cars will participate in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having led more than once in drunk, includes the car. 
The alcolock would prevent this because it is a system branché on the vehicle which measure the level of alcohol in the face of the vehicle, and if the driver does not before; or when the alcohol content of the driver is greater than that allowed. 
The cost is greater than 1,000 euros and is in the hands of the driver. 
In this respect, a study of the United States in 2007 indicated that vehicles fitted with this system cut up to 65% of offences during the first year of implementation. 
In Spain we believe that it could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure is that the administrative penalties for two reasons: To deal with these issues before they become criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made through normal channels but, however, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law. 
The system is not yet available on the market in Spain in any form of trade, although some industrial vehicles and office has already an experimental capacity. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to settle in school buses this system, as has been done in France. 
In Mexico without peep-toes' is 
Has 5.40, official currently planned, the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled atterrissait presidential in the warehouse airport DF Benito Juárez Mexico. 
The sun was on the eve of their own, but its shelves force to delve into a visière to see the royal couple off of the plane. 
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
A few hours before I asked in the streets, the taxi driver, if he is aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the town to end their official trip.

No, no sir, I am Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years ago.

Talk in sleeping 
Few children speak during the night. 
I do not refer to those who are waking up very awake by sharing something happened the day before, but the children who speak in their sleep. 
The first time that this has happened that may surprise you, but in reality it does not matter. 
It is a benign sleep called somniloquie. 
It is quite often, especially among children and adolescents. 
It is true that there is more than one who speaks during the night. 
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (once in life, for example, together with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, every week, once a month...), the day after the child does not remember nothing. 
There is no single cause which determines the 
They are often linked to other changes in sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors which were, the night énurésies (are out at lunch at home) or the sleepwalking, but this is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong found, to situations of stress or become agitated. 
In any case, it is a little studied. 
The intensity with which it happens is also very variable. 
It may be that it speaks with one voice alone, with words alone, wash or with shouts and tears, the long speeches. 
In cases where the somniloquie becomes very frequent, it would be good to see the child and expert advice, to check if there is a problem that causes great anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem. 
We have said that this is a benign, so there is no treatment, unless it is linked to a distortion of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a sleeping apnée or stressful). 
What we can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventative measures such as: 
Try not to whip up the child before they go to sleep. 
Therefore seek circuses alone and avoid programmes or television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and which have the death to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help calm internally. 
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to remain calm. 
You will remember that they are safe for children and that tomorrow it will remember most of what happened. 
Useful conseils 
Do not get on with waking up. 
It is unnecessary, because it is wrong and you réveilleriez. 
Even if he speaks, he is sleeping and is therefore. 
You will remember that it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety among children. 
If you understand what he said (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to ask for information. 
You will achieve nothing, because in sleeping, it is not clear to organize his thoughts. 
Moreover, you will hear what he said, but you will not know what it is dreaming of made attention to the way in which you interpréterez information and the conclusions you draw from this. 
Never say never to the child that you can ask during the night to its secret. 
Not even inform. 
This causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, don't worry, there is nothing so bad, it is an episode which lasts only a few minutes. 
Finally Illhaeusern... 
Illhaeusern has finally found the path to victory on the ground after a long period of shortages. 
Without a great match, the yellow and black have created the largest number of occasions and have managed to turn a match for the profit. 
The pace was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers have taken the trouble to speak. 
After a first attempt by the captain visitor Kauffmann which frôlait the lucarne on a range of Illhaeusern would take slightly ascendancy and in turn Fonderflick far, then with Hirn above, Roman, the end of the foot or Diebold were chatouiller defending Dannemarie. 
In face, it was block in the middle ground, and it was just the great Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The beginning of the second half, would be crucial to the first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by marshes, well positioned to take a ball rejected on a first attempt to Diebold (53rd '). 
But the striker Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the changing rooms a dozen minutes later and leaving outnumbered in its coéquipiers. 
But will take Dannemarie does not and will not pose major problems to a 11 illhousien who has just fallen slightly to "compacter 'defense, except in the last few seconds of game in which, after a great example, the ball was very close to the board.

The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House took over another to know that, John McCain or Barack Obama, has won. 
No surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters have declared their own victory in the televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, has not been sufficiently "brilliant" to halt the decline in the polls five weeks of the presidential elections. 
The Gallup Institute, an opinion poll published Saturday gives a lead of five points to Obama (49% to 44% to McCain), believes that it is the democrat who blew the game. 
Among the undecided voters, who are those that count, Obama emerged as the winner for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them are victory for McCain, according to a CBS poll. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the good provision due to its colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with its rival, Sarah Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It is a good instincts, "has, however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagénaire McCain has repeatedly put forward its indisputable experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naïve" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first contest. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused has several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured. 
Angle of attack stressed since yesterday in the Republican TV commercials. 
Obama, he said that it was the future. 
Without to dismantle, it has been concise and accurate. 
It has put forward its ability to take the right decisions, and to restore the US image in the world. 
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if", said, this weekend, a Republican the Democratic spot for not having taken full account of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the streets". 
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, has denounced Obama, yesterday, before 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an election rally in North Caroline under a rain battante. 
It has not even used the words "middle class" or "workers'." The clear financial advantage Obama, which is regarded by the Americans as the most able to save the economy on the brink of the abyss. 
"The coming week could be a turning point," said yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former of the Clinton administration, compared to the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
While reaffirming that it would cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois has also pointed out that the creation of a country's energy independence for the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a system of health care. 
McCain, he wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030. 
Careful, the two candidates have ducked questions concerning the bailout of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday evening by Congress and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election, you?" 
Young and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening on the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject in advance of the elections. 
A few hundred Belarussians met on Sunday evening at the polling stations closed on the central square in Minsk in protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation. 
While no results had not yet been announced, many young people were demonstrating against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "The dictator, resignation." 
Some have even acknowledged not voted: "Why, since they will do what they want to my voice," said a young. 
They do not believe that the regime which has done good foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic watershed. 
The sanctions, including a ban on visas for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were regarded as own observers. 
They have not been in the opposition. 
"We have been excluded from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the count," has deplored Iouri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous reunification of twelve parties. 
"It is a cosmetic change, emphasises Alexander Milinkevich, former opposition candidate for the presidential elections of 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that counts the votes, and it is the executive. 
If the members of the opposition are in parliament, is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into Parliament may mean the area on television, meetings in the regions and the draft laws. " 
The opposition has to enter politics, because "it must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
If our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, between in crisis, and that we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent. " 
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe which has followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the elections. 
It stresses that the figures for participation are too high, and that the increase in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all manipulation. 
"You have noticed that there was an election, you? Question Social Democrat leader Alexander Kazulin, one of the two remaining political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those who are better in power. " 
The silence of the night falls on the place of October. 
The television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission welcome their success. 
The interview - Du blood become safe 
Yesterday Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its chairman, the Dre Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the largest supplier of blood and effective security in the world. 
Above all, it has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously damaged by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980's and 1990. 
As you know, the national reserves of blood transfusion service run by the Canadian Red Cross have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
To this tragedy and public resentment, the government of Canada has established in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Krever giant, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster again. 
While the judge Krever tardait to submit its report, some provinces have set up a committee with the objective of planning a new system of management of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has fulfilled the mandate. 
In the wake of reports and Gélineau Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Company blood for all the other provinces, and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its work, only 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, remembers the Dre Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground in the years that followed, we have returned to the confidence of the public, "says proudly claim before the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population now québécoise Héma-Québec confidence. 
However, the Dre Décary in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile." 
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time it was in Europe to the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says that takes the very since its foundation in 1998. 
"And we do not know whether the disease could be transmitted by blood. 
It was based on one of the main recommendations of the reports and Gélineau Krever, that when we do not know and can lead to serious illness, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a brain degeneration inevitably leads to death, it introduces measures. 
In April 1999, it was refused the blood of people who had been more than a month to the United Kingdom since 1980. 
However, there are a few years, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
The episode has shown that the precautionary principle that has been applied had sense. " 
In 1999, appeared on the market a technique much more sensitive HIV screening: The acid test nucléique (Tan) which can detect directly in the blood donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, which were previously used tests. 
The Tan have helped to shorten the period, which stretches between the time when the person has been infected and when the first virus can be detected in the blood of our technical, explains the expert. 
It has been able to reduce this period in a period of less than a week. 
It has also substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected with the knowledge and that we can detect. 
These improvements have helped to reduce the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of blood contaminated with HIV. 
In other words, this means that we must distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before that strikes a case of transmission of HIV in the blood products. 
I believe that we can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe blood to recover the health, "says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogenic will emerge in the system. 
No later than last year was on the island of Réunion the virus chikungunya epidemic which, like the West Nile virus is transmitted by an insect in blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant ", continuing the Dre Décary before stress that security of supply, Héma-Québec must also provide an adequate supply. 
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing. 
Anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to recharge in example red or platelets. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which brings together on average Quebecois of only 3% of eligible to donate blood. " 
Any person in health, aged 18 years and meet the eligibility criteria may yet give blood all 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those who propose blood are not acceptable, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where there is malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With the 3%, we manage to maintain a list which responds to the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give blood. 
But it is difficult to persuade people to give blood, but above all to support and encourage them to become regular donor. 
The life of today, if unchecked, there is hardly the time to spend an hour to give blood, "laments Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also of human tissue and bone greffons, heart valves, skin and eye globes, which is almost exclusively used for the major burns. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Héma-Québec, which is also the only public cord blood bank in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste of a blood is rich in stem cells can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and are expected to take over a thousand per year. 
We should begin to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, "says the Dre Décary describes this programme of removal of umbilical cord blood as very popular. 
"Many mums are disappointed not to be able to access," because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and costly in every hospital in Quebec. 
- The Impact Soccer in semi-final 
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-finals of the series first heats round of the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 victory total (4-3) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the series quarterfinals in total goals, at the Stade Saputo.

After a first half without aim of both sides, the middle ground David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other types of training montréalaise. 
Roger Levesque has been the only off Matt Jordan for the Sounders. 
We must remember that in the first game of the series and, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in a suburb of Seattle. 
The impact will be measured in Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals. 
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder has overcome a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps has been about 3.5-4 semi-final round acceded to the total goals. 
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today. 
In short, But victorious from Kovalev 
The trio number one of the Canadian is ready to start the season. 
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn Tomas has led the attack in a 3-2 won the Canadian the rocket barrage against the Florida panthers yesterday evening, at the Bell Centre. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec has amassed two aid, and Kovalev has earned a place in this gain, the fourth of six Fiamma preparatory matches. 
Kovalev gave the victory with the sole purpose of the shooting. 
"I am not yet ready, warned the Russian. 
It would be another match to feel comfortable. " 
"It has tried to do in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau. 
But I think that it has appreciated the end of the match. 
It has been a standing ovation. " 
Charest on the North 
The Prime Minister does not exclude trigger elections before the end of the year 
Immediately after the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest has made yesterday in Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in the by-election today. 
"To postpone the limits of our last great northern border": That is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest has presented with visual force while remaining in the guidelines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech was thrown a kind of mill images. 
Went in off, on three huge screens, clichés spectacular hydroelectric generation, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", the cards, etc. 
The great resources as electoral period. 
In point of press, moreover, the prime minister has refused to rule out that it would trigger the elections this autumn, even if it has pointed out that it was very crowded. 
The 'Plan North "is the fourth part of a" vision "that the Prime Minister has for the Quebec, a" new economy ", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speech by Prime Minister recently, the opening up of the North - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - had never been presentation. 
Prime Minister, however, has been restricted to explain why the North was "a jewel in the huge potential", but has not to date, investment figures, or priority in the future projects. 
At most a few Avenue of what could be developed further, especially hydro-electricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, has boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platine, however, money, iron, titane, and even diamonds", according to the list of Mr Charest. 
This "territory twice as large as France '," it is here, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is there, but it is with us, "he insisted, as to demonstrate that it was asking a national myth. 
The Quebec has much built in its relations with the North, he said: The gold rush in Abitibi, engineering québécoise, the Bay James. 
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, having made a dramatic pause to contemplate the huge map behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory Quebecois of, includes a section Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has said the Prime Minister at the point of press. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated. 
There is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government, "he said. 
For the rest, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the north," he said about the Northwest passage, which is open all year due to the melting of the polar ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, Prime Minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the people of the territory, the UN Premières and the Inuits? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially for young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member péquiste of Ungava), have already begun consultations with thirty communities. 
A US committee chaired by Benedict Pelletier and in which Julie millstone (Transport and natural resources) has an important place has started work. 
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when we will provide a common vision ". 
The development of the north would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North will be "concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest has described this' vision 'as in line with that of Prime Minister liberals that preceded it. 
"As liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been one of the themes of the end of the week, which started Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the central Beauharnois Adélard-Godbout in dam. 
"Godbout, which has created Hydro-Québec, which has been Lesage quiet Revolution and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, Bourassa who made the Bay James, our party has managed to forge ahead," said Jean Charest. 
In point of press, he cited another reference, conservative, the programme "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the hydroelectric dam project of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest has stressed that its operation was scheduled for 2012. 
"It is us here, but I foresee be", he told his militants, causing home sustained applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of triggering an election this autumn, what the law allows it. 
It stresses that it is fulfilled, particularly by a mission of the board of the federation in China and a summit Québec-New York. 
The General Council of the end of the week Liberal leader has provided a platform of nationalist resolutions, including the "constitutional aspirations" who are seen as a letter to the post: The PLQ calls in particular recognition of the specific nature of Quebec "in the Constitution. 
We also hope that the Quebec appoints the members of the Council of the Canadian telecommunications and broadcasting and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad lines of Plan North with skepticism. 
The chief péquiste, Pauline Marois, has emerged from the development policy of the government Nord-du-Québec Landry was launched in 2001. 
According to it, the liberal government, in coming to power in 2003, has refused to implement it. 
If it did, it would be more advanced today "has commented on Mrs Marois alongside its candidate in Jean-Talon (elections taking place today), Françoise mercury. 
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a Plan North by the government. 
"But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle," commented Proulx Sebastián leader, replaced Mario Dumont, who is on holiday today. 
He letters - One country 
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh, the irony) Harper, which hits the summer of Louise Arbour said that it was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
Jeter and aspersions on this woman who has been a constant struggle for justice and which deserves our admiration in also says a lot about the environment and Prime Minister Stephen Harper itself. 
We are faced with a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, not to have brought back its national locked in a concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
A government which takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts which he is accused. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its floor and lets in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one who swear by a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember, remember that UNICEF, international amnesty and the Association of Canadian Bar, in particular, calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that it has a fair trial in Canada. 
It is this same government who condone torture: It does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of violence. 
It does not account, but at the moment we are seeing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the word that Harper continues to use and that sounds so hollow in his mouth. 
This is the time when there is no longer any moral: One can abuse, torture, a Canadian citizen arbitrarily imprison at the whim of a head of government minority here (what will happen after the 14 October...). 
Number of voters believe that they will find salvation in a which extols the virtues, the Law and the bar: They do not see that this government has refused to the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, it is, in this shift, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its meeting of 17 September, The duty has published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Pursuing a logical orwellienne, it says that the biggest gold company in the world has brought a continuation of slander of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a public debate transparent ". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of libel proceedings, but the law. 
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his? 
No matter the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the Book black Canada will spend large sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without mineral content. 
The tactic, in these fights unequal, is often ruining the accused to impose an amicable solution which bâillonnera opposition to frighten anyone who would dare to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate, it is the public that it should have presented his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally made by the exchange of ideas and not with club. 
It was mining, therefore, to open its books, files and to establish a genuine debate, through the newspapers, the media publications and the financing of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejected out of hand the petitions and letters of support for the perpetrators of black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how it can ask for a debate "public" while disregard the opinions of the same public? 
In the world of Vice-President, it appears that the word is only the lawyers highly paid and not all Canadians; that is a rather close to the concept. 
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or does not understand – Barrick Gold, it is the public who supports the authors and publishers of black Canada is primarily because it rejects the mining brutal manner. 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges, and not in the context of what many perceive as poursuite-bâillon (with the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also submitted a formal notice to the authors of black Canada told to stop the use of this term...). 
Beyond the speech of Mr Garver surréel, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, essential for any democratic society. 
It denies, en bloc, the right to the quotation credible sources and the debate on the facts and the interpretation, which form the basis of the intellectual work. 
It is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies in the world in a country such as Canada, under penalty of prosecution to repeat, which can do it? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate and transparent, it could do so following the scientific standards used by the authors of black Canada. 
It has a right of reply. 
The academic world, to which we belong, has long been known to manage the debates and the disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The continuation of proportion of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it says, it has no desire to a debate transparent. 
That is a loss for the academic world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments to put in place arrangements restricting this kind of improper prosecution. 
Rescue operation of Wall Street, Democrats and Republicans are 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the largest financial bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis rocking Wall Street for months must still be approved by both chambers of Congress. 
It includes: Better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money, new provisions to reduce the number of homes seized for lack of payment, as well as with the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued. 
The Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, have announced the good news a few minutes after midnight last night, at the end of a marathon negotiations of two days. 
"We have made great progress towards an agreement which will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to put out the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street," said the democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: If we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and the disruption on the everyday lives of Americans will be enormous," said the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had revolved the sprint in the final hours for fear of the fact that would lead to a failure on investor sentiment. 
The time limit that we had given was the opening of markets this morning. 
Associated with late in the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were in favour of the agreement, without fail, however, to express their dissatisfaction that we have to achieve this end. 
The Democrat Senator Barack Obama has given the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, including the proposal to allow homeowners to keep their homes and those on the pay of corporate leaders rescapées by the state. 
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain, it is not enough to congratulate itself. 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on American television station. 
On another channel for whether it would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes." 
"The broad lines that I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we can move forward. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said. 
The $700 billion plan to buy up with taxpayers' money bad loans, risk assets and sell of US financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months in a crisis triggered by the collapse of a housing bubble, which has led to the collapse of sub-prime mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other forms of credit more widespread titles (PCAA) and lead to a freeze of liquidity and the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
It is a group of elected Republicans that wrecked the first draft agreement last week. 
It is believed to be out of this impasse since the Democrats have agreed that some assets "toxic" companies in difficulty are only guaranteed by the government, rather than purchased. 
In order to cut corners for everyone in Congress, it has also added a provision that if the government should take losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help recover its implementation. 
The new plan provides for the payment of the first tranche of 250 billion which will add another 100 billion if President deems it necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billion should be ratified by a vote in Congress. 
In exchange for assistance, Washington will holdings in companies being helped to create dividends in case of profit and that it can sell when the storm will be. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the property loans affected by this plan, as well as to set limits on the pay and allowances paid to leaders of the companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light. 
The vote has continued to rise yesterday against this project, in both the Democratic and Republican camp. 
"Of course, Washington does not mean you," said to his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not one that is to take advantage of taxpayers'. 
A small group leader in Congress dubbed "the caucus of sceptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman present things differently, but comes to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred prominent professors of economy, including three Nobel Prize, wrote to tell us: We ask the Congress not to press and a close look at the path to take," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, we had once again the global nature of the crisis. 
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not be involved to acquire its rival in trouble since she has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the two major European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, they get the right to vote in the bank and influence. 
This is something that savers and households are now that the time looks uncertain. " 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British Government seemed to nationalise another bank bullied by the financial crisis. 
In the English press, the government would take over the whole of the bank loans at the Bradford and Bringley, which more than 41 billion (75,5 billion US). 
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy branches and customers of the British bank accounts. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British Government should nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
Its beauty in the eyes of blue card was long asset, some will say its weakness. 
If it was released in the mirror narcissique, the US actor in smile charmer? 
Yes, and not. 
Its shame, his sensitivity and a source of the talent flowing out will also actually giving rise to power of the sacred monsters. 
But what great long-distance athlete. 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, at 83 years, because of a lung cancer, invite him of Connecticut, remains one of the few icônes of American cinema in good years. 
Less monumental that Brando, to which it was for a long time, and it was a kind of rival to the screen, more cautious in her game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the collapse of the dramatic conventions. 
The children are often mixed extremely beautiful. 
It was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and mother in Hungarian. 
These European roots places a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without egos, the final stamp of quality. 
Because it is a country projeta enamored of self made man, the combating of the War of the Pacific, wounded in the fight, which in the early 1950s studied under dramatic art at Yale can be fréquenta the Actor' Studio in New York, before succeeding in theatre, television and cinema soon. 
The same man who milita for civil rights was also the pilot cars which classa second to 24 hours of Mans in 1979, a sex symbol, albeit a member of a couple model formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward were. 
It also disappearing with grey areas in the top secret, discreet, committed, allergic to the threat of show-business, which will not quite holes the puzzle. 
An honest man, in the widest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has provided the swindle the cinema goers later this week, while collide its larger roles on the screen dark memories. 
More than half a century of American cinema has constantly changing through him. 
We will have to remember the cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensuelle wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The pussycat on a roof burning adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Most of us (1990), its sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled by his old age by a marriage that do not fulfilled all its promises. 
Many other Paul Newman went to history. 
This boxeur Rocky Graziano, criminal, plagued, violent, departed in Somebody Up there Likes Me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, adopted after his death, which launched really Newman in 1956. 
This malfrat appealing in the brillantissime The Sting (The scam), Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Avenger and bitter ping pong player in the wonderful "The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the person on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who won him in 1987, his only Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face throughout the ages, it was him. 
Yet him. 
The time to get through its journey. 
Young people, especially through the experience we cultissime Slap George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of unorthodox ice hockey. 
Its fans have found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy CO2 brothers. 
With a final role of Irish Mafia godfather in Road to distress of Sam Mendes in 2003, and the circle was completed. 
In several film legends which lâchèrent early enough, Newman will be remained long on track, while denouncing Hollywood, its on its fanfare and its concessions. 
The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier regarded, not without humour, "as a challenge to the" underplaying "judge him too much of its benefits. 
The profession has not always been kind to the beautiful Paul Newman who cooked all the roles fell long in the tooth. 
However, he played less often young people first that the marginal: Névrosés, alcoholics, swines or desperate, including its features perfect reflétèrent excesses and the revolt. 
As director, Newman révéla poorly understood aspects of its true sensitivity both. 
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the story of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward were in the main role, traçait an end female portrait of melancholy. 
He who lost his son Scott by overdose him dédia his film Harry and his in 1984, and a sense of sadness. 
Among the rain of tributes which déferlait yesterday on Newman, a great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid) said, very sad, "it has made my life and this country best." 
Generosity, love of life are vibrants features of the actor disappeared. 
Beyond his career of legend, disappears as a major civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, a critical of the excesses of Hollywood. 
We have seen many its binette vinaigrette allowed to grace of bribes, sauces, biscuits and other foods, the process of poor taste, albeit joke at the outset. 
The profits of those sales were nevertheless paid to the Foundation for Children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on its myth, has committed to the end. 
It has left his five girls a letter containing these words: "Always and up to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege to be here. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist if lucid and so generous. 
Citizen model, in short, and in addition. 
That could well make Zuschlag & amp; Society in their factory in bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, will start the hearings relating to criminal proceedings underway, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices were accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organisation, permanent and regularly, has led to great damage and other charges have been adopted against them, for example, and use of false. 
According to the public prosecutor, the money from subsidies, was used for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
The money to the state and local authorities, approximately 65 million HUF in total, was in the coffers of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people. 
The method, published by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was to receive money grants obtained by issuing fresh bills, behind which no real provision was provided and thus, associations do not respect their commitments. 
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were false. 
For them, they are - full Józsefváros market bills, while they fabriquaient stamps to Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies that would be on the bills, it was decided, among others, in the northern province into Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag. 
According to the evidence of this last year, it was to identify pensions and restaurants. 
For personal consumption, he called for a bill, on the model of which they would other bills that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the city of the subsidies for access to capital. 
The majority of bills was created by István Lados András Őri and his accomplice, according to our information, cared mainly to produce the necessary for the achievement of subsidies. 
In a "direction-finding circuit", a choice of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people are in this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the foundation Jobb Jövőért, which will bear the name of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, grouillait errors of form and of substance. 
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, did in fact that three bedrooms, and maximum ten people can spend the night. But the bill mentioned 230 customers. 
The home stretch of the imagination of bills are also fallen in excess, when they mentioned Kft Pigal society, belonging to the hotel and catering sector. In their accounts, or the name of Jobb Jövőért, or the Hoppá does not appear, according to the information to the public prosecutor. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the society, said the site hvg.hu that when the public prosecutor has called and he has shown the bills, he has managed, immediately, he was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our number of tax were placed in the wrong place on the stamp." 
It was: "Beyond the form, the fact that the bill, 100 people were housed there, do not very truthful headline, since this establishment has only eleven chambers, which have not yet in place. 
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant is closed for a long time. " 
The issuers of zealous bills are not informed on travel agencies in Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. So naive, they have indicated residency in Hungary on bills to settle in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency. 
To surcroit, as it emerged during the investigation, they also ajoutèrent VAT on these documents, while the provision concerning the activities of trips, including the destination is outside the European Union, are paid for without VAT. 
Similarly, the rate of VAT on four bills based on behalf of the Hotel in order to Jobb Révfülöp Jövőért was wrong, because the benefits of society do not pay VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Moreover, the employees of the hotel bills are not printed, while the false were prepared to hand. 
The public prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers' have also made mistakes by mentioning as provision goods transport by road, that the company could not sending out bills, given that his profile was the advice on investment. 
Moreover, it is also for the dangers of forms, such as the types of bills inadequate and counterfeit pills, that bills issued the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, 21st. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved false. 
Just as in the case of society or the Ravenna Bt. Kunfehértó sporting experience, who both deny being the perpetrators of invoices in their name. 
The money launderers have not paid attention to the fact that the company Kft HIB., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001), the Group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home, according to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidateur society denies issued this bill. 
Bills deliberately established 
Another category of issuers of bills is composed of those who were perfectly aware that they were asked to make false bills. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the grouping Baloldal - Ifjú Fiatal Szocialisták, has drafted a bill to be the order of the Foundation has Harmadik Együtt Évezredért, for a total of four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of society Collab Kft. was forced to make false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi. 
Similarly, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, society Kft Biogate., which is now in liquidation and that in 2003, issued bills on the order of the founding Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, association and the association Vörösfenyő Atlasz Egyesület Egyesület, for an amount of around five million HUF, but behind which no provision has been made. 
No financial movement has taken place, either, given that the invoices have been cancelled by the result, but that the bodies have failed to mention it in their accounts. 
The category of issuing companies bills company is directly related to the accused. 
Thus, the chief executive officer of the company Kft Trió Delta., handling of the fuel and vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was nowhere to be found, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, the company has issued several bills concerning the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of approximately 18 million HUF. 
According to the survey, such equipment would have been bought by society Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The head of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to which Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents society, between 2002 and 2005. 
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that it issued bills on the order of business Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and he has earned their countervalue. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov Romanian builders of Jos Fa-Bani companies have created and Faipari Kft. Jos-Investment Bt. 
In reality, none of these societies are working, that the accused explained by the fact that they were not offered work. 
It is served when even these societies, since at the request of Maître Zsolt Szente, coaccusé and editor of the foundation of companies, he has established the bills to their names, in order to associations Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov gave organisms, 15 bills in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, to a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The public prosecutor believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on bills and VAT went into the pockets of Kubatov. 
The man has even used society to establish Bt. Szi-Beri false bills that have been used in the context of the grant application of Biztos Pont. 
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and has Blank Szövetség Magyarországért have applied for a grant from the body of public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (MRI). 
They have achieved this subsidy for a figure of 500 000 HUF twice, but these have not been used to the objectives set out in the motion. 
To avoid this will know, five bills society's received from the team Works Kft. have been presented to the MRI. 
Moreover, these bills that have been found during the raid on the offices of Árpád Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education. 
At the hearing, part of the accused relatera the method of manufacture of invoices, as it had already given the floor earlier. 
What would be really interesting is that the accused, János Zuschlag itself decides to lift the veil on the whole story. 
Until now, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he promised on several occasions to tell the details, it has not done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interests, or, possibly, the Socialists have reached an agreement that in exchange for the return of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would only the hat. 
Today, it is probably insulted, since the requests for its placement under house arrest, on the basis of a reduction of its conditions of detention, continued to fall on deaf ears. 
For those who have caused far greater damage, and the authors of economic crimes, not repairable, roam freely or at least expect in their own home, the end of the procedure. He has not this possibility. 
The psychology of the auction: Why dépense-t-on more money? 
At auction, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the commodity. 
The researchers neurology and in economics from the University of New York have managed to update the foundations of neurological and economic known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to a study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be dependent on this kind of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer even pay too high a price. 
These investigations have tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" with the help of experimental auctions. 
A voluntary groups playing the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while with the help of a process of functional magnetic resonance (FMRI), the researchers studied the brain areas trial subjects assets. 
In the two games, participants can make money, but during the auction an important element of which is the surfeit of a third, all under the waistline, called the striatum, was in intensive way at the loss of the party. 
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto-stimulation" of the nervous system. 
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices has to do with the flight to the violent reaction of the striatum. 
Has the support of their theories, members of this group of researchers economists have continued analyses of financial supervision. 
In these three groups surenchérissaient faced with a partner, in various circumstances. 
They are simply informed the group supervision of the real value of the product in question, and they have made their way. 
Has another group, they promised that if they went to the winner of the game then they would receive $15 additional, rewards. 
While the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group also lose money if they lose the auction. 
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed in one on the victory, while on the other, on the failure. 
In demonstrating the assumption of neurologues, members of the team players' against the failure "were willing to set higher than those taken by the group and the control group" for the victory ". 
"These results cannot be backed up by any economic theory already exists. 
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena witnessed at auctions that for the sake of profit and the parade before the risk. 
The methods of neurological imaging seules helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, leading, now, on a third explanation. ", said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics faculty of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When we should consult a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic disease liver is mentioned as one of the main causes of death. 
It is estimated that up to 100 miles patients carriers of the virus hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is the fact that many people do not know that they are carrying the virus. 
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infection of the liver and caused by different virus. 
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and the jaunisse are characteristics, but the pathogens and disease caused differ from each other. 
The virus hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two ways: The hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: Food or water contaminated), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus in the blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginale secretion, salive). 
For passengers, it is advisable to be inoculated against the A and B. It is no vaccine against the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A are two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated feed, in general, accompanied by a bad general state, weakness, nausea and headaches and stomach. 
Secondly to develop on the skin and a white jaunisse visible to the eye, the selles become clearer and more foncée urine takes a colour. The cure can take two to three weeks. 
Has the world, every year, a million people die of the worst form of the disease, such as cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main reason is that, according to some estimates, only a patient on ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: If it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because it destroys pathogenic gene liver cell furtive way. In many cases, the first symptoms appeared after 20 to 30 years. 
Consequently, an early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests. 
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: Those who have suffered a transfusion before 1991, the users and the tatoués. 
Currently, this figure of 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis Type C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in laboratories, it is advisable to consult a doctor treating from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be healed, if it is detected in time. The virus could be eradicated from the body, in this way, the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is threatened. 
On 30 September is the World Day of hepatitis, for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representing patients around the world. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by the virus, on the causes of its development and on the importance of the early diagnosis of the disease. 
Anyone who believes in God has he less pain? 
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of painkiller, which would have already made more bearable death martyrs Catholics. 
The Telegraph British newspaper published an article in which researchers at the University of Oxford have made an interesting experiment in analysing what the belief in God could influence the tolerance for pain of human beings. 
In the context of this experience for the bizarre, 12 believers Catholics and as atheists have been subjected to electric shock therapy, while each of them was a painting representing the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the Catholic faithful have been able to exclude a large part of the suffering. 
Thanks to a human brain palpation technology, it has been able to discover that Catholics have been able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, which of academics meeting each other, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate in various sectors of the university. 
More precisely, the experience was as follows: An instrument that introduce sparks and disseminating electro-shocks is set on the left hand of experimental subject. 
Researchers have asked the participants of the experience of watching a supported two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato what was done in the 1600s and the other, the Lady the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in 15ème century. 
Researchers at the root of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary refers to a kind of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its calming effect. 
The trial subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, meanwhile, have received 20 ECT in four side after, while watching paint is the religious theme, the more general issue. 
Catholics have said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as someone who "takes care" and they are "be quiet, and peace has invaded." 
In view of the painting of religious themes, they have accounted for 12% of pain in less than when they look at the effect of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who has taken part in the experience, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image among atheists, provided to find the appropriate photo. 
"We should find a picture which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, has welcomed the results of this research. 
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," said Wright. 
After these excellent results, it is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if it shows a Madonna believers painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same size? 
This is the view of the Virgin Mary better quality would be better results? 
You are what you divulgues to tone subject 
Has the opportunity to its tenth anniversary, Google says that we can find at the bottom of the pockets of people in the same way that the sky over their heads. He knows where they have spent their holiday, which experts they should consult and what are their interests. 
This is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of those who have influence in society. 
While the sceptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, they do not see the point of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main ambition of Google is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary for the founders of Google can meet their original purpose, which was as follows: "Have all the information system in the world!". 
According to the leader of Google questioned, after ten years of a global chamboulement work, they are still at the beginning of their aims to deal with all the information. 
The question is: What actually happens in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google can answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" Or "What is the work that I would be the best? '. However, software cannot respond to this kind of issue, simple at first glance, that the day when they will know enough about users. 
It is not clear to all users that the words used in the research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer launching research and the pages consulted by the interested parties are listed. 
By means of the programme Personalized Search launched two years, users can, for example, to store their own history of research and can see what they have sought, what they have cliqué. Thanks to this, in the long term, recommendations, based on the same logic, will be able to give answers much more intimate, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences. 
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if we look at what is my work? Require users, who worry about seeing the monopoly on information to Google. 
In most cases, it is the potential represented by the company that can cause to fear, and this is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can arouse a contre-réaction Internet users. 
It is, however, a fact confirmed that the terms sought are not only made, but in the justified cases, they are sent to a third, and in this kind of case law, nothing protects the personal rights of users. 
The most dramatic of these days is probably the Brazilian coordinated action against paedophiles, in which Google has sent the Brazilian Government the information that it has collected on the official website called Orkut, thereby providing an identification. 
Surfers mindful of human rights have been able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, confused with the EFF electronic legal protection, has proved her right to the court against the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google can still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the FBI secret demand, of whatever kind. 
(At the same time, the federal government has achieved success and web addresses some 50 000 research that it had won by the strengthening of the law on the protection of children, voted several years ago, but in the end, it fails to provide the lists of private users, or the whole list of Internet sites and the key words of these two months.) 
The judgment of Google is rather contradictory: It is attacked by those who fear the transmission of personal data, because they believe that their inner world and their private suffer when they begin to use the services Google. Thus, they address them in the spirit of rebellion that is against the multinationals proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the US geek culture and its "sauvageons" with the fans, activists and computer users enthusiasts who appear in many countries in Google the next generation of big business, the "corporation trendy", in contrast to its rival, Microsoft, classified as invader of the world because of Windows, and that, even if all the two are fighting for the same purpose. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, do not ask users of identification code, is not asking for money for its application. The code documentary and the package of programmes, continually refreshing, has a much more accessible, more young and cool, faced with the practice of the software giant. 
The reason may be that the geeks problems are exactly the relationship between the rights of the individual and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the key word as proclaimed in recent years, is right behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something else that cooperation, that the fact that we are intentionally traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication available to us, and for the extent of these changes, one by one, the essential remains the same: It is exposed. 
A young, in general, can take a public profile on several pages on Facebook to Xanga, and it can even link them to other services, such as to Twinter, or last.fm, listant musical habits, and then it can connect these to a system of prosecution, as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. these young people can also take blogs, in which are automatically their most recent photo galleries they stock on Flickr and Picasa. 
While we can see many examples, such as the girlfriend who understands easily to the order of the photos in the morning, taken by the ring of friends, with which his friend unfaithful has spent the evening, or that of the company that has dismissed one of its employees, in the sincere opinion that he wrote on his blog about the top management, it can be on one thing: The end of privacy is completely to reconsider these days. 
Those who live a life online, consists of what it shows itself, and that is so that we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people. 
He wants to hide something, or at least to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, leaving intentionally no trace). 
The number of people who deliberately, does not have to pages that it is not possible to recover, is not insignificant. The services of Google online, via the treatment of text the treatment of image, reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to a huge range of servers and who assemble not our best profile, has existed to date. 
The public expects, without actually hide, when Google dévoilera its true nature. 
The company, with its present value of 156 billion dollars, is more than $140 billion (IBM) and Intel (124 billion dollars) and Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). The AdWords and AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits brought up a more important cause severe headaches, not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs. 
However, observers criticisms are, in addition to all this, the contradictions of worrying effects: For example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the mother of enterprise and after that society has judged too costly daily multiple restaurants, taken any day. This pales beside the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiescé before the Chinese Government and the terms of their agreement, the company detect all results harming the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to an internal rules of society, new services are not announced that when they can be used. What is on, it is that in the coming months and years, they are going to change the world on new points. While some believe that the project to scan and filing of books and magazines dimensions of Google is so important that society will soon find themselves facing the Supreme Court of the United States, other tremble at its Health, because in this, we can build a comprehensive medical benefit from the results of previous studies, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google is a genetic data can give a good comes first to the next generation of authors of fiction. The famous Cory Doctorow's book, written with demi-tons orwelliens, described the future in which a man could be approached in a dazzling only through the data to Google. 
Two minors have helped to remove traces of the double homicide of Ózd 
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to the well-founded suspicions, they have helped to remove traces of crime.", said the spokesman of the station Borsod department. 
Young people have recognised the crimes of which they are accused. For the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two minors, which, according to the information Hungarian telegraphic Agency (MTI) are girls, to defend free. 
The complicity of murder is causing a detention of up to five years. 
The suspect the double homicide of Ózd, a young man in the corner of 23 years, has been remanded in custody, on Sunday. 
The charges against him are included multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest. 
During the investigation, it was revealed that the young man of 23 years was a large sum of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect would not solve its debt, and it is for this reason that he drew his creditor, last Wednesday in a Ózd site where it has killed, and that the girl of this man, aged 9 years. 
According to the information the MTI, the young man was premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit crimes hidden on the scene of the crime. 
The police consider the weapons and the circumstances of its use, with the help of experts. 
The stock of Warsaw made a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange 
The stock market values of Warsaw has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Swedish Crowns for the purchase of 100% of the package of actions of the stock market values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange of Warsaw, has confirmed this proposal that Poles have made despite that, previously, the Czechs have ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange circle of potential new owners of the stock market in Prague. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the stock of Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
99% of actions are in the hands of the Polish state that wish to secede from more than 60% of its actions in a few months. 
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the supply than has been made to date for the purchase of the stock market in Prague. 
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the stock market in Prague, said last week that among the parties, the stock of Warsaw would be the new owner less, and has not ruled out the fact that it could lead to the disappearance of the stock of Prague in the future. 
The value of the stock of Prague is estimated at between 5 to 10 billion Swedish crowns by specialists in the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of papers would be sold. 
The most important owner of the stock of Prague is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25% of holdings, followed by the FF 14.7 percent of the bank and the Tiger holding Ceská Sporitelna a.r.l. S. Four with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis of the point of view of the European press 
In their comments Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, worsening day by day, the leaders of the European press headlines about a "second 11 September." 
"The global financial crisis, it is the American President" - accuses the Rome daily newspaper, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a proposed law, improvised to rush to the aid of a despairing situation..." 
Has the power of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffetts -- hard-driving businessmen, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 September. 
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat to Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, the shortcomings of the political leadership of there, which has led the world economy to the brink of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is accroit every day, and subsequently, the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however, after the vote in Congress, a real threat that Washington does not propose to political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The global economy is in a vacuum, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the most important changes. 
We cannot ignore the threat - highlights the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger. 
Some states can be a lifeline to their financial bodies titubants, and thanks to their own taxpayers' money, they can save them of bankruptcy. 
Of course, if more banks collapsing such domino, nor the financial resources, or new improvisations will not be enough. 
In the long term, we need the Member of the European Union are few cases of their national egoism, and they centralising control over financial markets. 
Nothing that on Monday, the weak financial institutions have received more than 100 billion – has reminded the Viennese newspaper, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers also will have to pay very deep, in a similar way to the US in order to resolve the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really worked on the crisis, which, as a tsunami, is undergoing, hand in hand, the old continent. 
The "rescue forces wearing" should not hold up to EUR 100 billion, but it would be sensible if they notaient in any case it would be reasonable to reach the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage. 
The intelligent car bourdon following the theft of 
What method would be best for developing technologies to avoid an obstacle, if not the imitation of an existing obstacles to board in nature? 
As for example, the bees. 
In the draft surprising presented at the CEATEC, with Japan, bees bourdonnantes gave the strategic concept first engineers from Nissan, to draw on the way in which they need to develop the next generation of obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system to command bio-inspiré auto-robotisé, BR23C, he has equipped qualities of bees, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of preventing all obstacles. 
At its flights, each bee is its own area, oval form, which in reality is very similar to the hull secure protection - has explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and technological development and public relations. 
The eye to aspects of the bee plays an important role, since it is able to see in all directions, in a context of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the eye to facets, engineers have raised the idea of télémètre to laser beam. 
It identifies the obstacles in the way of 180 degrees and at a distance of two metres before the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the incorporation of board, which it hopes to move into straight away. 
The perception of the obstacle is taking place in a split second, and then the mini car robot imitating the movements of the bee, immediately change the direction of its way into the shift from a light enough to avoid the collision. 
Unlike the current system, this is going to be resolved entirely instinctively. 
"If we fail to do so, the mini car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratoire robotisée car and mobility. 
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the ozone the most vulnerable and most of the amount of protection, at a time when the collision is considered inevitable. 
This process must reflect what the bee is to prevent other bees. 
The process must be in a blink of an eye. 
Has the opposite of bees, the difference cannot go upwards or downwards diagonal, it cannot be that two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
In this way, the endless combinations of bees to prevent other bees, in our case, we could use that the movement rotatif, speeding up and slowing down as Beijing at the disposal of the mini car robot 
The BR23C uses polymère lithium batteries are lighter and whose focused on energy is greatest, which makes their result in the lithium-ion version. 
According to Andoh is the intelligent knee-jerk reaction, which is essential, not the processing of data, and even less the ability to store. 
This mechanism must deal with that some signals entrants per second, and respond to them. 
It is not necessary to the store and intuitive approach based on data from previous games. In this way, he uses only a few dozen kilo-octets of memory in continues. 
We do not need to remember the ability of gigabits, or even méga-octets. 
This is the first step towards the creation of a technology for the instant avoidance. According to estimates of Nissan, this system will make its entry into cars manufactured in number in the next ten years. 
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination avoiding obstacles in its path. 
It has even been given a name the baby out of 
The written version of the economic rescue plan for $700 billion to buy up the bad loans from banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent. 
Reuters news that during debates even until after midnight on Saturday, local time on the east coast, the leaders of Congress agreed on the existing controversies for days on end, around the rescue plan for a total of $700 billion. 
"We have taken a major step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, according to which we can only put the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
The Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and will be effective, but other measures must be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the wheels of the economy in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of markets in Asia 20h on Sunday evening local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but has not resulted in a spectacular rise in the stock markets. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote for the bill responding on behalf of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then, its fate is in the hands of the Senate. 
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush has spoken to Pelosi, then, the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved this night, and we are very appreciative of the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and our economy," said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. 
Moreover, the programme differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she stated that the $700 billion to be spent at once, for the purchase of securities on dubious loans. 
Now, more than half of the ECU 700 billion will be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the bill by Congress, probably on Monday. This first will the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad loans from banks, while the use of an additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the Chairman of the Federal Reserve will take part. 
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
The terms of the law, the Treasury Secretary, will put in place a combined strategy: It can, at the same time, buy bad loans, bonds and mortgages on bad mortgages and other types of loans "toxic". 
Those responsible, the ministry said that the takeovers can take place in the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule provides an opportunity for the companies concerned, to take part in a programme of insurance, where the Treasury Secretary, provides the tools at the root of the concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to predict. 
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether in the wider takeover of dubious claims, insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system triggers the collapse of a major financial institution or another. 
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared for the application of the law, as it will be signed," he said. 
By contrast, the leaders of the banks in bad stances and the state aid can expect their redundancy payments, called simply golden parachute lands across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The capping of wages is mentioned only in the specific case, the restrictions on the way in which the Treasury Secretary proposes its aid to the company. 
The principle of capping means that if the Treasury Secretary did in the framework of an auction, they prélèveront a surplus of tax on the golden parachute lands, unless the discredited bank based on retirement. 
Directly after the takeover of bad debts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the sum paid to the leaders should not be exaggerated. 
If the picture is complete, we must add that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The ceiling is that the new contracts, having to motivate and participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the US legal ceilings that will be in force on the allowances of the Directors-General - has commented on the chairman of the committee in charge of financial services to the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank. 
Moreover, the state has a right to acquiring shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk to taxpayers is declining, because they can even be winner in the matter as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved rebound on their legs. 
The bill mentions that in the next five years, President must submit to Congress, a proposal which will decide on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
Both sides, there was, of course, those who have expressed their doubts about the plan. 
This does not mean that the US citizens we have commissioned, this does not protect the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican member of California, Darrell Issa. 
His fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur believe that they are the same people who are taking action, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Barack Obama and McCain support both the plan to rescue banks 
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidate for the presidency of the two major parties in America, to support the government's rescue plan of $700 billion. However, there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the US Secretary of the Treasury. 
After the negotiations marathons that have lasted for days on end, the representatives in Congress and the Administration have finally announced Sunday at the beginning, that they have reached agreement in principle on the plan to rescue banks. 
This level of funding for the improvement of the crisis on Wall Street and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are the same, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the latest polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a little ahead. The advance of McCain, achieved with the appointment of Sarah Palin as colistière just after the Republican convention, has melted away. 
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama has expressed his hope that Congress vote quickly the law on the 700 billion rescue plan. 
He has stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that also supports. 
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility (...) threat your job, your savings, the entire industries and the stability of the economy", he said before a crowd of 35 000 people.

In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analysis of the causes of the CSU dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The revolution devours its fathers in Bavaria." 
According to the political scientist acknowledged, the erosion of the CSU started before the sad tandem Beckstein-Huber takes office. 
The Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these are the same people who are turning their backs on modern. 
This change is at the same time, the problem of Christian democracy, and this fact, also Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, came to end a process that was likely to it, just ten years: The unquestionable dominance of the national party ended. 
It is ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU is ramassait with 47,7%, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50%. 
It has been three years in the Bundestag elections of 2005, when the so mentioned Stoiber. 
The question can be attributed to the modernisation "devouring their parents', put in place in the region in a consistent with the CSU. 
It is 40 years that sociologists say that they have been deceived about the pace. However secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern Germany and is in the region of Bavaria, in full development, cannot remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters CSU. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and obstinate. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks, this is precisely the traditional groups of citizens who are rather far away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, artisans, holders of the box and graduates of higher education. 
In these groups, the support the CSU has fallen below 40%. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
In his article entitled "Who?? The chairman of the party will be on the reserve in response to the questions of the coalition," the conservative Austrian newspaper is dealing with the situation of the internal confusion has arisen after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian Socialists the SPÖ wish to discuss with the conservatives in the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs. 
The populist party BZÖ is open to negotiation. The Greens do not want to reach agreement on the coalition. 
The elections were held now everything revolves around the coalition, during the debates on public television, the party leaders have barely suggesting their cards. 
Werner Faymann, the President of the SPÖ, has confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation between the two parties is possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the Socialist partnership. 
The question that we imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Mr Molter, the current president of the ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he said, the orientation Schüssel-Molterer was, in any case, rejected. 
A repeat of this combination is out of the question. 
Mr Molter reacted with caution to the proposals of red. 
As he said, a cooperation will surely if Faymann unsuccessful attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition and the entry into the coalition is a matter entirely open. These points must be debated within the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the chairman of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals. 
"In order to avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are ready to assume responsibility of government," said Haider. 
Járóka said: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, has started, in Paris, the European Summit for equal opportunities, including the guest is France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union. 
In his message speech before the plenary, as one of the spokesmen for the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, who Fidesz European People's Party, has drawn attention to the segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law, which affects the most Roma children and this fact, one of the main obstacles to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference has been opened on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for the work of Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the referendum, the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of the legal protection and European civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office of the Group of the European People's Party Fidesz MP, Járóka warned that distinctions in the recruitment, the Roma are disappearing from the labour market, in the first place, due to their low qualifications. 
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of a poor quality elementary education, only a tiny part has the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma." 
Moreover, Járóka has insisted on the fact that education as a basic law of human beings plays a key role when we must make the other fundamental rights. 
Investment in education early Roma children means strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the who, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible, including the Roma and non-Roma. 
Indeed, earlier a Roma children start school, it increases the chance to become productive members of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, it is the budget of the state. 
"Because of their nationality of the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from low quality education and sectarian." - has stressed Lívia Járóka. 
According to the European Union's cooperation geared towards a goal and an action is necessary for an acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools, respect for existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of vital importance. 
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, exclusion and the unemployed. It must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens on the future of Europe," has demanded Járóka. 
On behalf of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities "guaranteed for all, the objective of the summit for equality of opportunity in Europe organised every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to ensure a unique platform for support measures in favour of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and at the level of the Member States. 
CSU: The thanks for a transitional period. 
It is in October that will be taken the decision on the fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein toppled 
Despite this pathetic failure, heads are not yet fallen, and the debate on the personal questions the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed. 
The President of the Party, Erwin Hube and the leader of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is: When will the thanks to? 
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a vote of 17%, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held last weekend in October. 
The members of this pair very criticised have, in any case, felt that they were not particularly to their seats. 
Thanks to this, they have sought to soothe angry members of the group and the basis, a day after the Bavarian tsunami "demanded of personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
It is five years - it is true, even under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career, winning socio-chrétienne union 60.7%, whereas today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been the single sovereign "of Bavaria giving 18% of GDP. 
But the Conservatives have always strongly in this region in the south, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal review of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as a possible successor to Huber, has also received a place in the small group of recognition, who instigate of discussions with the Liberals tâtons FDP, and with the Free Electeurs, along with the values of the right, on a coalition government in Munich. 
A mockery strange fate has been that with the help of the list of Free Electeurs between in the legislation Gabriele Pauli, taking action against Stroiber was the possibility of coup carried out by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then deal with the very ambitious municipal politician. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilise, one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which until now were the behind the scenes, also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, has appointed on 28 September as the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber has launched a scathing remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have been much more support from the sister party. 
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
After the elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor that if they put up in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, who played an important role in the success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, hard to hide the disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of the CSU will not adversely the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What is on because it will not be easier to manage the CSU wounded, and the crisis of the last Social Democrats. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with just $18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko – rivals: 110 - 0 
No Member of the opposition has not in parliament after Sunday's elections. 
According to the Russian observers, this was due to a country governed by Alexander Lukashenko, it ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is because illegalities committed during the counting of votes. 
The OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections. 
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in the country of 10 million people is very much opposed for many decades, before the elections, the opposition between its forces under the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate of President for the fourth time in Ugly Elections, following the amendments to the constitution in 2006, "would," this time the presence of some members of the opposition in parliament. 
In this way, the ODSZ has renounced its boycotting originally planned. 
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent on Russia, would improve its relations with the EU, where the Belarusian political order as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entrance visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has taken a cause of the reduction of Russian natural gas imports, always more expensive, and has contributed to the passage of society and Beltransgaz, owner of gas shipped across the country, happened in the hands of the Russians. 
The fact that the OSCE, the evaluation of the countryside, put the emphasis on the positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban to run for a third of the candidates for the opposition, made reference to a prior appeasement. 
However, the release of the OSCE on Monday challenging the campaign, in which the main opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition is still a tangible improvements in the political system: The political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and the separate Abazzia of Georgia, but Russia with which the Belarus form a confederation on paper, consider the two independent territories for a month. 
"We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the European Union," said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
According to the opposition candidate for the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that this remains so, despite that "the power has been fear in this Parliament which carries no weight, to get even a single opponent." 
The opposition does not provide for actions of protests in view of the results. It is trying to send a message on the need for economic reform to the electorate. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concern in this area: We have to give our newspapers opponents in Russia, the local authorities we put a spanner in the works for the dissemination, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its principal outcome, the ozone pensioners most supported officially really no longer regard it as appropriate. 
"Because of the country's debt and the rise of the trade deficit, the collapse of the social security, evoking the silence of a cemetery, is not only a matter of time" - believes Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers have described the democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarussian electorate. 
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before the work. 
Never in the history of the Palais Chigi, not only had the revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But as of today, is in force this new measure against the smart, against which advanced and will then drink coffee in a bar during working hours. 
The new anti- loafers has been presented today by the Ministry of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Council presidency, Mauro Masi. 
‘ The doors tournantes- tells Brunetta- are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services, "says the minister. 
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
"It is the reform" also emphasises Brunetta. 
The installation of all of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Palais Chigi. 
I Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view. 
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General: "That is shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all". 
In short, over breakfast during working hours; more coffee or increasing. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests in smiling, "a cappuccino to 7h in the morning is a good and positive resolution". 
At a conference in the public administration of the 
In Rome, the Minister noted that "'in three months, the absence of disease public employees are reduced to 50%, or 60milles workers in a year". 
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the public administration. 
In Italy, "which explains the dynamic salariales- ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of employees, united to challenge the standards of the decree Brunetta making use of the Codacons. 
"While the Ministry of Public Administration today projected data on the decrease in attendance at the workplace because of the Association of written maladie- consommateurs- the people 'layabouts active" continues to increase. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration, met to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree. 
In particular, the tar, excluding the extra benefits in the event of injury due to service; the extension of working hours of continuous worker domiciliaire sick, during which are carried out the inspections, and other items in the new provisions advocated by the minister. 
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Prevention is crucial" 
Every day, in Italy, there are 2, 500 accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who are disabled permanently. 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm that the white deaths have been around 1 200. 
The figures indicate the seriousness of the problem which remains one of the main causes of death, and almost twice as many deaths as the murder. 
For the attention of the institutions, the social forces and the means of information on this dramatic, the famous Anmil today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58ème National Day of victims of accidents in the workplace, enter the second Sunday in October. 
"The worrying information provided by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirmed the importance of the issue of prevention in the workplace," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, a message to the president of the Anmil, National Association of mutilated and disabled, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses its "heartfelt appreciation for the continuous effort associations in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of workers injured, assistance to the families of the victims and raise public awareness." 
"Of course, everyone has struck down to put an end to such tragedies which, for their part, are the cries of the media and the involvement of the public, even if the everyday reality is the tragic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic. 
Napolitano cannot deny that there is certainly a matter of resources: It is ECU to invest in training and information " 
The many initiatives promoted in the education sector, have a particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work. 
It is our duty, maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not in assessing the alarm on the serious social, and improve the legislation. 
For its part, the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini has pointed out that "white deaths this phenomenon is an absolute social emergency, who insult the conscience of all of us, and for all the institutions, to make a real effort to stop it quickly." 
The actual data on the work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of dead white is impressive, "said the chairman of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" tendency on the cheap "is in fact a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention is acquittal, that is the tragedy. 
"We believe that, in general, it is not enough to block the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through many actions." 
‘ In exceptional Mercandelli- pointed out more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important on the training of workers, and this at school. " 
– It has ajouté- "we must make more of an effort in relation to the communication and raise public awareness. 
"But we must, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers faced with a phenomenon which represents a social emergency." 
"Mercandelli then denounced" the gradual deterioration of the conditions of compensation for the victims of work "and the" leakage of assistance to which the system is moving in recent years ". 
"The objective, therefore, is to restore the worker insurance guarantees — he ajouté- so that the fate of those who has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or enlargement of the legislator" 
MP3 player mentioned as, they put at risk the hearing. 
Ecouter music at full volume for an extended period using portable music devices like MP3 players, can cause permanent damage to hearing. 
That is what the European Commission announced that, in a statement released in Brussels, the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the health risks contingencies and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This report we read in the note- scientifique- 5-10% according to those who, for a period of at least five years, listening to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour per day per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity." 
"I am concerned about the fact that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can damage unconsciously irreparable damage to their hearing," says Meglena Kuneva. 
"According to the data scientifiques- pursues the responsible UE- there is a clear risk and we must act quickly. 
What matters most is to raise awareness among consumers and make the information public domain. 
We need to review the existing control systems in scientific opinion, so that they can be fully effective and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels has asked the Scientific Committee independent, to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that they generate. 
"The executive scientifiques-conclue UE- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could be taken to protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices. 
There is already a European standard of safety, which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but the hearing concern is growing about the damage that could lead to excessive exposure to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit the data making use solutions such as the reduction of the level and duration of exposure to noise. 
The EU Scientific Committee notes that the users of portable music devices, listening to music at full volume (over 89 decibels) for five hours per week, exceed those currently in force on the level of noise effort made in the workplace. 
Those who are listening to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after five years. 
This is 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we are starting, in March we end, in June we will have. 
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of Rome Capital ", which took place this morning, the new seat behind the spas of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the 49 other parts of the Commission will the directives in Rome. 
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the City Council will assess the analyses and projects, to present in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp on Capitol Hill and its mayor Mr Alemanno. 
"The Committee is totally independent; all the political, social and cultural représentées- it wishes to emphasise Alemanno- it will propose ideas of development of Rome, which will serve as political decision-makers, who are the Committee and the City Council. 
Any imposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where a great project for Rome. 
In March, she will complete its work and disappear then, because this experience must have a period of time. 
At present the maire- juin-annonce the strategic plan of the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. " 
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno reply: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is, as in France, thanks to the Commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on his contribution will be essential. 
Too often the policy is burdened by the management of the newspaper and emergencies that occur from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see progress, and further towards a deeper vision, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future. " 
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that the Commission is not an unnecessary bureaucratic or a whole body: It is absolutely free, and will not cost a penny to Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and get the best minds who express the capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed, "it is kind of a strategic reference, or to stand firm or, in order to enable our city, to improve, it is absolutely necessary, all with a view to its future is now a spirit of unity,". 
A future that, says the Mayor of Rome, "is not restricted to the usual local borders, but which takes further" not only in the context of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but also with regard to the role that Rome can and must be, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama? The first president anti-American. That is why. 
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti-American. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in its decisions, destroyed the US economy and were reports (as it has always today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam. " 
The attacks on Obama are rising as the election draws nearer. 
A woman of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition". 
Obama is very rich: He believes that he will win the highest office of a nation which account in all five senators and two black governors! " 
In reality, it is attacks which do not say much; it is, of course, racial nature of attacks, and do not respond to the question of all voters: It will be a good president? We also polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is still of someone who speaks from the heart and not with the brain. 
A Mississipi newspaper, in the southern sandpits of the US, wrote an article: Once in the voting booth, we know that the American patriot will give its vote. 
This is that one aspect of the American mindset kept secret until the end. 
"Say what you want, we see ourselves in the cross, on Obama or McCain. 
There are the same people who swear: If Obama wins, we will start with the United States. 
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of a black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush. 
We asked to 1500 people: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89% replied: Iraq. 
The America. 
In Vietnam, the nation has lost 50 000 soldiers and was sent back home to the fesses up. 
In Iraq, 4 500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags. 
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will have an enormous damage to accomplish. 
America, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: In the press, it is the deletions, and many blame the Internet, this "murders" paper newspaper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been arrested by the Pew Research Center regarding the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not declared to the value of information, feel less concerned about credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as past. 
The problem of American journalists, it is the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroying economic model. 
Moreover, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the authors are involved in the collection of newspapers, are a big problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to the reporters interviewed, if we want the traditional as the public sees fit, will be reduced. 
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalism. 
Six in 10 senior executives of printing of newspapers and journalists are convinced that journalism at national level is going the wrong way. 
Locally, the Group Executive is to 65%. 
Publication printed against broadcast. 
Journalists were not hard to see where is going to the Web. 
The greatest houses éditrices is making its way to the Internet, seen by many as "the murderer 'paper newspaper. 
The "economic pressure" that feel journalists is increased up to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology is hoping that it "do something positive" for their journalism. 
Today, the agreements, the largest in American journalism lies between who run the newsrooms- the directeurs- and reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%. 
For some, this is linked to the "safety at work. 
Managers who lose their jobs in the space of three years, are of 47% at the national level. 
As regards the journalists, it goes to 30%. 
The "work course" at the staff level (our authors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract. 
In a great nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often provide what they want, and it is becoming a matter of take or leave. 
The directors are almost always large salaries, while the editor can win 10mille dollars per month, in addition to the insurance and pension payments. 
As for the holiday, the logic is simple: X days after the first year x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, after a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, American journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
It is the fault of the climate. 
UNIPOL: Court ROME, DANILO COPPOLA remains A GROTTAFERRATA. 
The President of the second section criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the authority of the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who was asked to leave the city, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the framework of the investigation on the escalation Unipol-Bnl. 
During the trial against him, last week, he had reached the domiciliaire transformed into Grottaferrata compulsory residence. 
His lawyer, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the estate agent can go the distance of the city of province in a house in the capital. 
According to the Court, such movements (the entry has not granted) would allow him to influence its society and to have access to the evidence that the blame. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon has already shown a few days, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of $700 billion approved by the White House: A significant number of Americans was, and still is, most interested to punish Wall Street to save the US economy. 
And that is the New York Times yesterday that confirms that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, even more divided between his eve soul East Coast, moderate in federal institutions and the business community, and its soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington 'and the world of finance, powerful, especially in the countries of the South and Centre. 
The soul, precisely, who has made an despotic way with the vote which I spoke at the beginning. 
But what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announcement or is already running: Not only the United States, but in the West, and can be not only that here. 
The United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena couvés for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidifient and show. 
The first of these is the updating, the extraordinary revival, the dual category Etat- sovereign, compared to a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of bancaires-financières institutions which have, of course, closer relations with other countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in a single state. 
This creates an immediate political problem for which the rules: That is to say as a response to the difficulties and the protests of individuals and families who are also the electorate. 
In short, the crisis is global economically and politically, it is almost here. 
The international political really seems to be sidelined or, had little to say: The evidence is provided by the European Union, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is to decide on a common political line. 
Thus, it is the government of each state that all await the speeches, the rescue and recovery plans, the new rules, and especially the breakdown of appropriations: When it is going through a difficult period, there is that the Member States who have the economic resources, the financial resources to try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use them: Two invaluable resources, something which no market or international organisation will never have the same way. 
This new prominence of the nation state is in perfect harmony with the major still more recent economic developments in the economy tend to give a factor quite linked to this point: The territoriality. 
. Ironically, indeed, while we were convinced that they have now entered the realm of the network of ever more sophisticated technology, equipment, convinced that the global finance had been intended to dominate the world, we have found a blow to one, that our future will instead solve its accounts increasingly with things somewhat material such as water, harvest, oil. 
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the land, but which are related to definitively to a limited area, a territory. 
Thus, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards that anyone who does not, i.e., those who have the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water. 
I come now to the second new, which provides a split. 
That said territory, state, government, inevitably Policy said, and therefore Leadership. 
In this respect, the economic crisis appears to produce two phenomena converge. 
On the one hand, the awareness of the need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who will take control of the situation. 
On the other hand, a wave of into the existing leaderships, economic species which have proven to be inadequate and full of grey area. 
And furthermore, something even more profound, in a certain sense, even worrying: A shadow, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance which tends to involve the whole class directors in an increasing number of country of the West. 
It is even more convinced of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their height, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, at the same time, and to be still more alien to the views of majorities. 
In short, the application of leadership, fueling a, a powerful and become more ramified délégitimassions movement of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are in the "revolts' stop-gap elections or, in the collective mood changes to these very recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Britain, the American delegates to the rebellion against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the Right in Italy is not by chance). 
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would have more difficulty, which is not new, to understand and to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis, increases and wave of potentially too. 
In view of all this, the current rebellion of the masses "on the agenda, seems frankly excessive. 
But it is said, bear the full, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Defeating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, to the walls like Spiderman. 
That is the objective of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutions almost succeeds. 
With a was removed just 2.5 cm2, researchers have managed to maintain a body of 100 kg stuck on a vertical walls. 
The ETUDE- The US journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by a team of researchers, is a development of those that we are using a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes. 
"The principle of the glue can be thought of as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have inspired the legs of geckos, covered in microscopic hues that will ensure the animal, a perfect adhérente. 
The testing of various materials, such as the glass, the téflon, and the paper, glass, have shown that the new removed is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, it is too easily to the walls, "explains Liming Dai, researcher engineering faculty of the University of Dayton. 
Walking on the walls? — "this material could be used as temporary removed" adds Liming Dai. 
Can be to walk to the walls like Spiderman? May be that yes, but researchers believe to be much less attractive as the connection between electronic appliances, because these are drivers carbon tubes nano heat and electricity. 
Other applications could affect the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment, no super heroes. 
The other RECHERCHE- The University of Berkeley, California, and it also, in the search for a new removed. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society American journal, researchers have presented a California removed formed of microfibres as hair, which is the dust has to clean car in the area on a perfect and to ensure a constant grip. 
Medicines: Never with fruit juices. 
Attention pamplemousse juice, orange and apple. 
These drinks, consumed in the summer because désaltérantes and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital medicines, to undermine the absorbement popular or reducing the case, their effectiveness, with very serious consequences for health. 
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, points out the risks of fruit juices that they are, in boite or cost, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, it launches a new alarm: A glass pamplemousse juice, orange and apple, to reduce the absorbement of some vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The pamplemousse juice has been heavily criticised because held accountable to increase the effects of some drugs anti- arythmiques, antibiotics, tranquillizers, anti- staminales and neurological, up to toxic levels. 
MEDICAMENTS A risque- It is the Italian Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products itself, which gave the new in a newsletter dated two years, warning doctors and patients not to assess the danger in this mix and to ensure that we drink, if you take drugs, for example, the Diazépam or the methadone. 
Not that FEBRUARY PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to the experts, even the orange juice and bone contains substances that inhibit medicines. 
Long is the list of active principles inhibés by the pamplemousse and other juice. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the University of public Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international agencies of medicines to the need to change the notes instructive medicine. 
It is always read the papers illustratifs medicines and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to make it clear to the doctor or pharmacist 'stressed the expert Ansa agency. 
The winner of the economy to Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade patterns and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien who teaches at Princeton University, and it is also a famous writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event was more important than the first, in terms of impact on the history of the US. 
A provision which unleashed many controversial, and which was danger to the economist for years, but now proved correct. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of the scandals such as the collapse of Enron and Worldcom, have disappeared from the public," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great economist, but also a divulgateur style" very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, this is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft" 
It is the day of the spread of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity, which aims to reach still more users, the home of the office, professionals in the public administration, proposing a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office. 
After almost a year of work carried out by the voluntary developers, monitored by Sun Microsystem, the new package Open Office is the public with various innovations: The welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less rigorous, to other more important, as the compatibility born to the system opératif Apple Mac os X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document format) (2), the latest version ISO standard. 
Open Office has particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.) 
Also interesting, certain specific models, such as reducing the PowerPoint presentations dimensions, useful, for example, to send by e-mail, or to import module of leadership in the PDF graphic design, keeping the original aspect of the page. 
Still on this front, it is possible to create documents "hybrid PDF" between the graph typical of Adobe format to calculate map or a producer of text. 
The cooperation between several people is something which has had various improvements within the applications: In the calculation map, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes in the draft texts, because each employee is attributed the colour of comments for greater recognition in review phase. 
Some companies are even working to bring some functions of OpenOffice on the Web (the Cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should make the final outcome. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and added to the English version which was on the Mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac os, the result is as usual available for Linux opératif system. 
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or in the workplace. 
And if the issue of free can be a way for the broadcast in homes, precisely in the business, the Open Office is the great challenge, can count on various projects in the public administration and schools. 
Without mentioning the realities which offer a service of training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to the prospects of business. 
Open Office modules consists of five main: Writer for video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the roadmap designed to replace Excel calculations; Impress, for a PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the programme which allows us to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the module chart. 
The goal for 2008, up to 5 million download, whereas today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, it may even exceed the figure proposed 
Kohl, is positive, it is the fourth cases of doping. 
New cases of positivité at last Tour de France, the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and the winner of the jersey for the best climber. 
It is the site of the newspaper The Equipe which brings the new. 
Has 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera, the EPO of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and Germany's Stefan Schumacher, the Gerolsteiner too. 
The blood tests carried out on the test of Kohl are part of those carried out in recent weeks, by the Chatenay-Malabry laboratory in Lausanne and. 
If the against analyses confirm the positivité the Cera, the world will lose its third place in the Tour and must forcement expect two years of disposal. 
The news of the positivité Kohl the EPO of third generation, has been confirmed by the leader of the French agency anti- doping, Pierre Bordry, which has released to the Associated Press, have notified the positivité the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans has placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre American and Cadel Evans, raflant peas and the jersey for the best climber. 
IMMIGRES: The New York Times SI SE demand Italy TSEs racist? 
Italy "as a nation of immigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants' met with resistance. 
This transformerait-il the Beau countries in a nation of racists? It is intéroge the New York Times who devoted a long article discussing the issue of racism in Italy, in the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing biscuits' into a sounding. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defined as the "northern paradox: The Nordic regions are those where there is more integration and more work", but also "a feeling anti-immigrés the strongest and most important support for the Northern League" 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislature sought by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the return of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the Pope and by the President of the Republic, "Giorgio Napolitano at its meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked what the church ‑ state work together to overcome racism." 
Rents Etudiants victims, up to EUR 900 for a chamber. 
The market for students do not know try to crisis 
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, rent a simple room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious to exclude entire groups of young people, the right to study because of the total costs are very high that the families of origin must soutenir- explains the responsibility of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, strong demand on the part of students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has amorcémême for residents. 
In most cases, the offers to hire also contain a series of violations: Free contracts, not registered, without limit of rent, sous-locations. 
For the Sunia, exceptional measures through the revision of taxation, are needed to ease prices. 
I read in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, on a bed in Brianza, it is approximately EUR 450; for a simple, there is at least 650 euros (area Gang Nere), to an average of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and fiera) to a maximum of EUR 900 (area Vittoria) 
In Florence, a bed costs on average EUR 350 / 400, a chamber around EUR 700. 
Has Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it must 250 / 280 euros for a double bed in a, and 370 500 for a simple. 
In Rome, in the areas of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately EUR 600 for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a simple) for the areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
We cannot save that if people living in peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple Predestina zone, Centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, for a bed to 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, it spends 400 to 600 euros, with high prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari, to read, there are 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In the smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the economy in towns and cities. 
Finally, the cities such as Perugia, in which the kind of letting are often taken by non-Community students, there is a further anomaly: The rent asked foreign students is increased by 25 / 30% compared to the Italian applied to. 
Adieu old cinema Paradiso, cities éliment historical rooms. 
Close historical cinemas in favour of Multiplex. 
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it is as a face without" 
The image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what happens in large urban centres Italian, but also in the province. 
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the rise in the periphery of major multisalles, and the death of mono consomption rooms in central areas of cities, is a major events which we believe is inevitable and clear; it has all the characteristics of a true crime cultural. 
In the end, it is often the historic places and responsible for memory, "it is as if one of my friends was broken, someone known, with which we have shared a way and so many emotions" is the director of the movie Nuovo Paradiso, film which offers Tornatore there 20 years ago, the first Oscar as the Grand Prix jurée of Cannes, and telling the poetry of a province, and nostalgia for a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever. 
The figures provided by Anec, the main traders, want to say: In the last five years of the traditional kind 316 cinemas have closed, and this is the main cities who have paid the price: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan in Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 to Palermo. 
One of the regions most affected by the closure, the Roman Emily heads with 82 cinema halls mono lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The evidence confirms t that primary responsibility for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have the most new cinemas multisalles: 195 screens Lombardy in the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as Emilie-Romagne. 
"The Italian exploitation has developed a irrational" observed Paolo Protti, chairman of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we do need to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm in a town hall, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to the multiplex. 
Without discussion about the failure of credit for traders: Debt antécédente of the state is around EUR 10 million. 
It is a disgrace that étique and moral point of view, the government does not respect the existing laws. 
In order to support the sector, it should be between 16 and 18 million per year. 
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a memorandum between Mayor and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinema halls mono historical centres and outlying regions. 
Among the prescriptive, there are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: Viewers can enter the area to movement restricted, and have special tariffs for the parking spaces and in some parks. 
"It is an initiative which I sorted" observed Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures. 
It is clear, however, that, to block the super power of the multiplex, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of its and the image, because the public today is more demanding. 
Traditional movie defence is an issue which for me, has always been important: The closure of Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to "New cinema Paradiso" which I thought already since 10ans. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have both been mixed emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the signs noircis by the dust. 
Liens between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardise the choice of the interests of the Mayor Piromalli clan." 
Serious accusations made by the judges of the anti-Mafia department of Calabria, with the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli's Liberal Socialists, arrested this morning for external assistance for mafia association. 
The manettes for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former Ombudsman between the clan and public administrations, and his small son lawyer, namesake of bosses, already condemned to type of Mafia, and to pay EUR 10 million. 
"An insult to the prescriptive legal and moral, and especially in the right direction," write prosecutors, both local authorities had expressed the desire to pay consultations to Maître Piromalli. 
"And it would have been given to the juges- -écrivent clan to enter officially within the councils in facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and public administration orientement" 
The Chairman of the regional council Agazio Calabrian Loiero, does not hide the fact that the "collusions between the local committees and organized crime, there are more of a" in the region: "There are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there is also a lot of politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest " 
The arrests follow this morning of July, during which the police have told the clan décapitée Piromalli. 
At the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved, already in 1991, and always because of alleged treated between organised crime and the local authorities, local politicians had been relieved of their duties to administer the City. 
Mr Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the collapse, has been appointed head of a center-right coalition, after the run-off of May 2006. 
He shouted scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
It accusa Deputy Interior Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing it of having manigancé everything to a political issue, but given the request of incarceration signed this morning, judges, meant that the clan Piromalli had even manages to ask the variation of the project of the A3. 
Consequently interception ordered against Dal Torrione, the entry write, is émergée 'willingness to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a group of more experienced, close to the Piromalli, harmonising the choice of public administration to the interests of the clan. 
When energy is born of waves, now the big embark. 
This is a huge source of more than 70% of the surface area of the globe and now the global energy companies are now discover. 
Waves and currents, tides, that is the new renewable sources on which the behemoths like Chevron have asked me, and now trying to get their hands. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movement of the sea is considered for 200 years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, the research intensified. 
When the price of oil declined to 1980, the idea to exploit marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in the oil sector give a major boost 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London ruled in 2007, that 15% of the world need electricity could be covered by operating systems of the choppy seas of the seas. 
This amount would be double that produce nuclear power stations. 
And in addition, there is the tides and currents. 
The behemoths attack. 
The first to focus on the marine energy has been the Enersis, which in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a plant in the north of Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, I would have said a true not revolutionary. 
Two years ago, still more candidates among these companies will always to rely on the traditional energy marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the energy technologies océanique- said the spokesperson for the American oil forever associated with the company, the Wall Street Journal- economic daily and evaluates the opportunities to cooperate with us." 
Cooperation in question, is a deliberate made by the Committee for energy, necessary to give rise to a marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a very important sign, especially if you consider that precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently the President Bush has put in place a plan for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. In New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, wandering the path of energy from the sea, and the sums invested until today, although their details are known, indicate that the observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to point. 
The experts say a technology that is still in its infancy, from the fact that the marine energy dispelling fears about the environmental impact. 
At the moment, the systems such as those from Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we must use of technologies with a higher environmental impact. 
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other. 
The surge of waves, which is wagging the sludge into the high and the low water pressure is converted into the pistons and its cylinders inside the cork. 
The pressure spin a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator. 
Energy is sent to the shore through the wires under sailors. 
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in stage, in anticipation of a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used to a military facility. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, the case for a commercial centre and a lot using six turbines marine under the East River in New York. 
The movement of water at odds, runs the pales turbines, creating a generator powering a rotational movement. 
Verdant announced a long list of customers waiting for permission to draw energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Research of electricity, deserves the potential of the tides. 
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is expected from wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
And it is precisely on the power of the tides that states such as New York, Maine, Alaska, with others, to look at the coast, invested $7 million in 2008 and provides investment up to 35 million in 2009.
