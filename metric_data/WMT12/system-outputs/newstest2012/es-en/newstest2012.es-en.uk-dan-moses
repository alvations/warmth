Victory in Libya
The history of the liberation of Libya, or of the rebellion in Libya, already has sus perdedores.

The only justification was that, from his point of view, the attacks by NATO not ran un US General, but greater Allah, whose greatness tras held each of the successful interventions.
When you are looking for vencedores in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught up in a firefight that sirven islamists and nuestros políticos para get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally sin que guarantees to make a profit.
Tras recent bad experience of Afghanistan and Iraq, not ocupamos Libya militarily.
In this case, the local gives them un problema expel the “ crusaders ”
Pero, without ocupación ¿oil companies will be with the gold black libyan solo with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that the West can finally presumir to protect human rights.
Siempre que followers of Sharia law, we are not cross.

More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 years have problemas overweight, where overweight affects the 9% of the population of school and obesity at 5%.
Obese children proceden in its majority of families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to research today.
Se vuelve to show the importance of the environment where they grow up to un healthy development of the person, as well as the models that sirven reference.
At the table, the children obsesos se feed, for example, of sausages at least twice as often as the children of families to be reckoned normal.
Para dinner, more than 19% of the obese had dined patatas chips, the day before the analysis, which is linked to the programme of prevention « obesity is not a by.
The families of overweight children is not accustomed to sports, which applies to the majority of families today, where only 15% of children respondió que sus padres, at least once a semana, find tiempo para physical exercise.
Survey 900 children
The poll realizó at the end of last year in the same school and participaron almost 900 children of basic education across the Czech Republic.
Ya was the second edition of the programme “ obesity of is not a by, which supports the company of Safer Health - General and the company Unilever.
Until now, have participated in the project more than 12 thousand children from fourth to eighth place.
Una quite correct diet and exercise in family are determining factors, to reduce significantly the number of overweight children and even obesidad.
« We only half of the children surveyed have responded by saying that tienen five meals daily según regime: breakfast, lunch, y picnic lunch, dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet » uno, contains the results of the survey.
Sin breakfast but with sausage, para dinner
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, are important, moreover, the details, which also includes, for example, tener una hour set for breakfast in a family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of the families of school ate breakfast at the same time.
In the majority of families, each desayuna solo.
Pero worse was to discover that in the 10% of households are not desayuna nothing.
The breakfast, however, is the basis of a daily diet right.
The study shows that the families of obese children se consume much more often the insanas patatas chips.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily refrescos sweets (70%).
Por general rule makes sport more than 40% of children surveyed, however, between sus padres to reduce this result was less than half, only 15%.
Fabrícate tu diet
The next phase of the study posibilitó que the kids elected (204 boys and girls of 172 13 schools) was created sus propias allowance on the basis of all bids posibles según sus tastes and opiniones.
« Food preferences of the czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal. ”
Among his favorites are food se pasta, meat and sweet
« Is particularly alarming, the popularity of sweet », warns in the final report of the study.
As food principal se takes the biscuit pasta and follows closely poultry meat.
Prácticamente, children rechazan siempre the legumbre y the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are prepared to change their eating habits si reciben information fair.
« In the control group of the participants in the study, which the questionnaire rellenaron after ending the prevention programme « obesity is not a by, in many cases a major change in favour of the principles of a healthy diet », it goes in the results of the study.

The hairdressers also be a good psicólogo, argue the professionals
In the article, how can learn the introductory estilistas, because I complained un poco that initial ya lessons were quite charged.
I had no idea how to run things.
Conferences three officers working in the industry, to people how vestir problemáticos y, moreover, a seminar sobre how it works in the entertainment industry.
It will be peor.
The closer they are final examinations, more information and tareas prácticas ahead
Although the current y develops each sábado y Sunday, no longer has a pin.
We are vez have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course, there is no man) on how vestir to the woman who has no simetría perfecta.
Y that is the great majority.
Someone is cuellicorto, anyone has a feature stylized sin curves right and someone sufre sobrepeso.
The hairdressers know suavizar ópticamente unos to prolong a broad shoulders, neck o recrear curves necessary
We have been given certain trucos sobre how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, of pechos y caderas huge pero waist close and at the same time not vestirla in a way too challenging
Si, for example, the difference between the waist and the caderas is all que skirts o trousers are not appropriate, it is worth asking sewing at least an extra trozo patches to measure.
Sin certainly will not regret, because the clothing that sienta perfectamente is invaluable.
With a skirt to measure sentirá much better than with a question which not to move, stand up, danced in the waist, etc.
The body stylised se puede permitir vestir ropa with pliegues, ornaments, embroidery o drapeados.
There are certainly many types of information and of bodies, so I am pleased that we have all week to poner orden in my all this information.
And even then, I fear that the task assigned tengo, because more than adequately.
To each participant in the current has been assigned two famous, that he will have to devise two vestuarios: one for the day and the evening otro para.
We need to take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion than se tailored to the person in question.
I was vestir » to Miranda Kerr, perhaps you speak of the campaign of Victoria 's secret.
Cry for inside, that to me is a lot better than, for example, Britney Spears o Christina Aguilera, which recently have fattened unos 100 kilograms (in favour, will take into account the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez.
Dresses tenemos que recortarlos of magazines o later on the Internet and imprimirlos after drawing them graphically.
The moodboard, which is as it is called the outcome is complete, expresses up our personal style y nuestra relación with the graphic design.
It is also important to pensar in the chart in the styling.
The hairdressers, therefore, not viste solo physically, but is also involved, for example, of the pages of products in the magazines (specific topics, as trends, handbags, coats, etc.).
All of this told us the hairdressers y designer Mario Kameník.
Pero todo this is already para Sunday.
The hairdressers has have global.
The three guests specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on todo tipo of bodies.
The hairdressers Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka y photographer of fashion Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the hairdressers should saberle sacar partido to this.
Un y good hairdressers sabe trabajar with the same prenda dress in various ways.
The variability is, in this case, central.
So, the gabardina (or as they say in English, trench coat -) can be vestir to classic with vaqueros y T - shirt, but also serves to vestir the naked body with of zapatos tacón y fotografiarlo as if it were in fact a vestido.
O well enough arremangarla y subir the neck for obtener una totally different picture.
« Jugad this ”, he insisted.
What more valoro Council is the following: “ to begin to work, it is essential that you speak primero todas the rules ”.
« Then podéis romperlas » Jakub, said.
Por so it is clear why memorizamos todas these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it in magazines resultados we are different.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that hairdressers tiene que tener more types of clothes in the reserve aimed at taking photographs.
So, for a history of fashion than tenga ten pages (so, ten outfits), we have to take preparadas, ready to usar, at least 15.
In addition to the photos y clothes works in combination with other prendas, all of which are different from those which are in use in reality.
Todo that needs to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and the style suponen themselves, in many cases, half of success.
You only have to look at to Madonna, which is not exactly one singer extraordinary, but the image and márquetin have made it a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not yet a clear tendencia to use the services of the estilistas.
Until the characters famous también find them useless (enough my abilities, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).
Y when someone asks us nuestros servicios, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a talla very different to his real (lower).
Only queda guglear y find out if the magazines of the heart ya have written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight / thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza y Mario we insisted that the hairdressers is not enough orientarse in fashion, but must understand outfit.
In her work, was primarily must communicate with people to the one dressed, so it is essential to be good un psicólogo.
Sabe valorar people, not less, defends its opiniones.
« When a headmistress os para recruited him clasifiquéis the vestuario y que se the completéis in fine, you can 't throw - away todo what was, and say: “ Huy qué horror » ».
« Encontrad at least a couple of things that podáis ponderar y que recomendar para someone may poner », says Mario.
Él also showed us that todo should be in the so - called “ placovka », that is to say, the stock exchange.
This is set around the waist and se tienen a necessary tools.
Son objetos as tijeras, as tijeras, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. there is also a thread of nylon (which use the hairdressers during the session on photos of products such as handbags o que caps), pinzas special can clothing por ahead, if this were higher (the pins, y otro tipo of enganches are not allowed, which could damage the fabric), or a game of tailoring.
Para not to stay in the listening pasiva y poner something into practice, we have learned to become the suela of shoes.
Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in an area plana, it could damage the suela y much more abroad.
Y we did more than revestir y revestir.
We could not tocar shoes with scissors para not harm por accident.
So we have to be very adept.
Mario has given me a joy to pay tribute to my work reservas sin.
The truth is that it does not give me very well these skills.
This is only a small part of everything we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
Ya I have realised that devote myself to the styling at a professional level is not a way of talking, but I see exactly like what people say.
In Need for Speed The Run: se toda compete for America.
Reseña
Un viaje carefree, in principle, it is complicated because of a series of lapses improper of a journey rutinario during the next morning.
To some extent it failed to meet expectations, but that is not helpful, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which adds to the title se the Run, attracted a great expectations ya before its premiere.
Prometía que give new pieces to the former saga of racing Need for Speed y, following what is shown, appears as a game that should not end up being otra vez un gender of action with no more.
También we are curious por saber how quedarían inserted the scenes, where the character principal drops from car and walk around su propio pie.
As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results have not changed very little about what we could have hoped for.
There are racing que se pueden to acceptable, but in the total se pierden puntos because of failures absurd, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, you cannot call errors, but rather the unwillingness of incomprehensible programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
Se os introduces in a story, the protagonist, Jack, has some problems personales; for resolverlos, he is offered in a race participar illegal toda America.
You sentáis behind the wheel in the west coast, in San Francisco, and vuestra mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route was divided into 10 stages and, then, in more than 50 careers.
It follows that every race tiene ruta for a different and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
That way, you must not remotely the feeling that the game ofrezca siempre.
Some of the areas resultan even pleasant in sight, although the technical level graph is equivalent to that of previous rendition of the series.
Por tanto, is nothing out of the ordinary.
Pero the ride por the desert, the landscape otoñal o the high mountains of snow covered producen un visual effect is very pleasant.
In addition, the careers diversifying from time to time when for a typical element.
So, for example, in the desert os encontráis una tormenta of sand that reduced visibility.
Instead, in the mountains of the need to be careful that you sepulte una avalanche.
Según that, each of the racing is very well developed.
There are a couple of solo models, but this is enough.
For a moment, trying to bring to a number of rivals required (normal in a race classic), after tratáis to gain time (classic duel timed) and then os expects a duel against a solo adversary.
In the middle of all this is sometimes the police, which only complicate matters further.
The novelty son the landscape outside of the car.
Se presentan interactive animations when Jack, in the majority of cases, it has to escape from someone and vosotros tenéis que help, always pulsando button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Resulta sorprendente, however, that it has fewer paisajes in the game of what we would expect (in particular there is only tres).
Pero the end result is a good thing, because this is not to be rude, y in the already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game resulte more interesting.
The model of driving sigue the fingerprints of previous episodes.
This means that already today is not much, but you cannot claim to be a bad thing.
Si buscáis una simulación realista, already podéis look elsewhere.
Pero to a career designed quite action suits him quite this driving style, but we can find something better between games of the competition.
So far, so good.
Pero problems arise after a certain amount of time.
Unlike the right of the models of driving, because the same is not true of the collisions.
Games of this sort cannot expect recree deformations y collisions complicated, but in fact, before a coup against any objeto, you can 't predecir how reaccionará vuestro Auto, which means that not everything is in order.
It is typical that, as a forward very tight or move the car with traffic normal, only has roces light, but in other situations, almost identical, your car has just doing piruetas got out of control.
O even just totalmente destroyed.
Thanks to the system of reseteo, are not big problems, but it can poneros in a bad mood.
The reseteos are programmed so that, when sufres un accident or te sales of the runway, the game te restituye the last point rescue on the runway.
Sin embargo, in every race solo se has five reseteos available.
The si consumís todas, you must reiniciar the race from the start.
So it is no more than a help in the event that something does not go well, but it is not very unreliable.
Sometimes, nor the reseteo aid, only learned the aid given the stage of memory.
Una great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts repiten in different places.
In some curves, for instance, you have to go in a unique way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Otras veces os encontráis somewhere vehículos « siempre civilians ” with the same configuration, even if you are the first, quintos o lleguéis five minutes before or after.
This makes rabiar sobre todo in situations, when two legislation veis que van to a meeting in opposite directions, your opponent sin problemas ahead, but when you, you must be o well curb.
It is like when lleguéis, because is scheduled por que “ shock » siempre sucederá in front of your nose.
The opponents also tienen ventaja more.
Throughout the game llegaréis sites where, without taking into account the time, always os earlier the same opponent in the same place.
In addition to this happens at the end of the game, in a long puente, which is even more shocking.
Your oponente must come before vosotros, whatever the cost.
When it goes ahead ”, makes the vision of cars vienen head - on, so that the principle podéis papilla make the car.
Se puede understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose - hanger, and adrenalin, but the execution is so apparent seguramente os down immediately.
This is a pity, because although the model of the journey sea simple, the game is fun and with action, so often it is not possible to continue to detail what happens and where.
Y realmente gives equal if the credit has been the idea with 50 pistas exclusive or the classification in the career for is not quite the boredom, or anything else.
Una unusual idea is to change the cars during the careers.
Tenéis que be attentive to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because it tenéis que change self, although in the vast majority of cases os suffice it to you.
Cars se divided into three categories.
The sports son suitable for zonas urbanas, cars strong Americans for motorways rectas y the exotic superdeportivos para una técnica driving by, for example, mountain roads with curves.
In addition to narrative thread principal también there is a thread of challenges paralelo, that is to say, there are racing in specific places fruits ye shall know por stories.
Conseguiréis here not only medals, but also of experience to vuestro perfil, which serves tanto para challenges as the tales.
To achieve the higher level, the drivers are opening varias posibilidades, starting with the car y ending with funds to the profile.
At the same time, there are connected una Autolog role in line, which compares vuestros resultados with other players and disponibiliza otras functions.
Uno elements more difficult to understand is how it is made the last race in history.
With the car arrived to the tunnel subway (pase), where os ponéis to run in the dark por channels (pase).
The velocímetro os between 150 and 200 km / h (pase) and, suddenly, os comes the convoy of the metro and se os riding roughshod over sin.
In the drafting seguramente tendremos una discussion on this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game to none pensó siquiera o un poco si authors we really toman por una of the panda.
The technical part of the game is not unusual, but at least the effects visuales general resultan in the majority of cases, savory, sometimes even soberbios.
Pues qué pena que, in the most tense moments se reduce the quality of image and, at times, in a way that is serious.
This particularly affects the accidents where there are many participants involved, when the picture quality continued ya is not valid.
The audio is good and the soundtracks is a matter of taste.
In order to make it appeal to the bulk of the youth group, the soundtracks pertenece in the category “ each of his father and his mother ”, but can be suponer que no one will buy the game solo por su music.
The feeling end of Need for Speed The Run: it is therefore pretty confusing.
The game si avoid mistakes, we have absolutely tontos problemas in stating that the Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.
You get the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is guaranteed, but preparaos porque os will attack the mistakes in the eye with the strength of a reflectores airport.

The ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The czechs have una reputación of negativistas y eurosceptics.
« The Lisbon treaty has affected significativamente the balance between the institutions singles ”
« I hoped to montase una war without barracks ”.
« Durará five, six years ago, before the situation stabilises un poco, grip on itself and the new players accustomed to their new papeles », began with convincingly its conference on the faculty of law the czech ambassador to the EU, girl Milena Vicenová.
How to not be taken seriously its motto “ clearly and openly about Europe ”, which said in the first part of his conference, when it managed to describe every organ of the EU and its relaciones precisión y with such clarity, because that would be the envy of many speakers of the faculty of law the U. Daisy.
Vicenová también ponderó the work of permanente of the new President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
The first « surgen criticism, if this is bland, an officer grey, capable of taking any rol, but I have to say that left everyone confused, because it takes its roles to perfect ”.
« Is a man who sabe listen to the members of the 27 states, to communicate with them and that tiene una visión obvious must go where the EU. ”
The new position representative of the foreign and security policy se explains on the basis of the question: “ who is this EU and what número puedo call? ” pues. this is an important step towards unification and clarification of political union for states such as China or India.
No one wants to prohibirnos cheese Olomouc
Vicenová se had also addressed the agenda seguía seguirá is continuing and the European Council in the near future.
The czech two years ago was a success.
The Czechs ocuparon of the economic crisis, emerging resolvieron the gas crisis and organizaron una Summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative, which severely injured in the Czech Republic.
The czech representation in the EU has por the time many compromises.
In the words of the ambassador: “ a good fuss ”, not just the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now.
Por otro hand, it has to approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
Si the budget is simple and effective, what are the sectors tendrán prioridad, which countries recibirán greater support and less than? this is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador recordó también sus slogans principales, with which came to Europe: “ regarding biting Europe with clarity ”.
«, It is true that I do not like the abreviaciones Ugly, extranjerismos o the jargon que people not deemed ”.
How can « ¿un citizen understand that in Brussels are not invented really cucumbers curved cucumbers o redondos bananas from differing sizes o que no one is going to ban cheese Olomouc? ”.
También pretende sacar more benefit the environment of the EU and bring more czech citizens to the european institutions.
We expect the Europe of speed
Según the ambassador, the czechs have a reputation for eurosceptics and the people perceive rather the negative aspects that positive.
In addition, lamented the low participation of the Czechs in the european institutions.
The fault of a host of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support for the Czechs.
After the success of the czech, stressed the strength and the cooperation of the Group of Visegrad.
« Believe me when they go to a polaco un y se hungarian and I approaching a Slovak, a Frenchman at my side, tells me: “ what, because you have quedado, the group of Visegrad? ” either, apparently did not do him any grace ».
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, await you nuevas regulations harsh budgetary policy para Member States.
Se percibe as something very real of the concept of a two - speed, if not more, in Europe, more than the new “ the Federation ”.
« We países in the eurozone and países outside the euro zone ».
« Tenemos the Schengen area and tenemos in addition the procedure for enhanced cooperation ”.
« Se first said que solo cooperate with those countries that want to y non - to remain outside ”.
These procedures « serán increasingly and reforzarán Europe of the two - speed ”, it is hoped Vicenová.
In that sense, also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and of Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, whereby all the issues that affect the whole of the EU should discuss between the Member States, not only between the members of the euro zone.

Su slogan “ think! ” is made in its sello, around which will be building the life of the future (giant was also the title of a magazine internal IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a culture of company carefully lifted.
« Para us, IBM pensamiento involves a long - term, a perpetual motion in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived y prosperado for over 100 years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without temer changes around.
This has allowed us to, during our primer siglo, transform technology, business and society.
We expect prosperar even more in our second siglo », said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
Un sistema sofisticado
Watson, as in the 1930s - the care of their employees as the employer of Baťa in the Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were among the first operarios Americans who enjoyed paid leave, safe, uniform elegant and un sofisticado sistema remuneration premiaba the best inventors and vendedores.
The same sofisticación long - term keeps the IBM in the relationship with the customer.
Ya from the beginning the company supo discover talentos (as one of the first global firms in putting an end to any kind of discrimination, could choose without problemas).
In line with the strategy of anti - discrimination is the current plan of IBM, Palmisano to replace it the forward woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working treinta years at IBM, where it has been head of sales, márquetin y strategies.
Over the last few years, IBM has played the so - called meetings virtuales, rain of ideas in line, from countless future strategies and innovations.
It is no surprise that sobren ideas, because in the signature trabajan almost half a million people.
Una institution with a good reputation
The position in the business proporciona fixed to the company a strong image internal and external.
« From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution more than company tecnológica » profesora economist, says the Harvard Business School y author of the book on IBM Rosabeth in Moss Kanter.
« IBM is not a company tecnológica, but a company that seeks to resolve problemas of business for usuarios of technology ” puntualiza George Colony of the consultancy Forrester Research.
As the company says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business.
IBM - or the “ Great verde » - as it is known in the US families because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the biggest companies in the world.
The company is possibly tecnológica more versatile (develops tanto equipment such as infrastructure and services accommodation web within a wide range of services, ranging from servidores until nanotechnology).
Ostenta the largest number of patents all the technology companies in the United States and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions se found the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, the bar codes; the diskettes.
IBM facturará this year 220 billion dollars. this year has become the second signing tecnológica por market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when superó por primera vez in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the taste of the clients and the time (IBM not opted for su propio sistema operativo, OS / 2, services online Prodigy u ordenadores IBM PCjr).
« Si su business based in advance, can 't emotionally anchor in the past ”, acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Por that IBM has no problems on building up its bases in other plataformas (and equally, if not working, left).
Y there is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which are basically maintains and falls siempre exclusively with Windows.
Tecnología future
In a matter of sales, IBM se devotes sobre todo services, of which approximately one fifth son of programmes and otra quinta equipment.
However, even in 1990 teams representaban more than half of the share of suppliers.
In the year 2000, IBM has sold assets of underperformance por un valor total of $15 billion over the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology of the future.
The investments have followed since 2008, when we first said the modern global financial crisis.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis of the 29 increased investment.
Parece que until now the company IBM has been able to weather the crisis.
The value of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 estratosféricamente has grown to a 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
The currency of IBM is changing all, save its valor.
Se puede, therefore, expect that when I come to the next crisis, this giant flexible aguantará.
IBM 's history: from the cortadora cheese until space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM ya se takes in the year 1924 - originalmente se trataba utilizada of a mark in the branches of Canada and South America.
The base that resulted in the birth of IBM surge of the merger of four companies that are remontan at the 1880 's.
Poseía inventions as the famous “ reloj of file », which allows control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 también presidió su supervisory board.
Flint fichó at the head of a company in the competition, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson siguen siendo firm on the basis that sustentan corporate culture and identity).
Watson asked the company until 1952.
IBM, as its title suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices business, from cortadores meat and queso until tills.
During the first four years ago that Watson ran the company, turnover is doubled in 9 million dollars and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company, tras almost 40 years of elected chair of the Head, was replaced by su son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM started work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language programming.
In the 1960s, the staff and the computers of IBM helped NASA to guide the flights to space (Mercurio, Saturn y in 1969 the famous vuelo to the moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System / 360.
The classic « pecés », which installed the standard computers from that time, came to market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Veinte years later, IBM vendió su producción computers in the chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the part of consultancy company Pricewaterhouse Coopers y began to offer a comprehensive advice and servicios high value - added.
The strategy has paid IBM these past three years is the concept Smarter Planet, which is to say, “ a planeta smarter ”.
Su objetivo is more rational use of the technology is not yet have planned the areas and has improved the circumstances, for example, in the transportation and the administration of cities.
Para trade sector, IBM presentó not long ago the platform « Smart commerce » que permite retailers manage the business cycle.
IBM tiene una long history in this country.
Ya in 1932, opened a sucursal in Czechoslovakia, the first country to had it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM ČR opera in the centre of outsourcing strategic in Brno.
The site for central and eastern Europe is in Prague, and here too there is a research team of fame global trabaja with the recognition of voice.

To Rychytář does not care with whom sleeping su woman.
Si un day Rychtář rompiera with Bartošová, his wife did not expect at home with open arms.

The worst vicios of women: does it also se refieren to you?
Si pedís to men who sean able to cite a few vicios típicos of women, in general, every one of them, the appointed pensar sin.
Queridas women are you reconocéis in the following budget lines, which cited certain vicios female que unable to boil the blood to men?
Shopping
¿Reproached su average orange so tiene dependence on purchases?
¿Tiene por que bought a trapito in, week?
¿Likes to buy often in cuts?
Then in his case it can say that go shopping se has turned in a vice.
A few women realize that should quiet their pasión por purchases, at least a little.
Pero to see, what woman could resistir the temptation to walk more for sin of clothing shops, seek prendas well adjusted y after probárselas todas in probador (ideally in all different colours)?
But for the majority of women go shopping is a pasatiempo, for men puede prácticamente turned into an inferno.
Solo recuerde ya how many times has said his partner que better wait in front of the door.
The dissatisfaction constant
« ¿I am not too fat? ”
« Necesitaría slimming por least five kilograms — should begin to exercise? ”
« ¿Really te taste? ”
¿Not suenan these phrases?
¿Who sí?
Then is one of those women obsesionadas por su aspect.
It is that you should leave care, but many men are allergic to listen to his partner quejarse todo time of their physical aspect.
The sex strong also agrees that the more increases the frequency of the complaints, most embarrassing se vuelven women.
The order and the clean - up in the first place
It is like a tiovivo indefinitely.
Cleaning up the windows, to turn the vacuum cleaner, mopping the floor, removing the dust, washing the bath y todo for at least twice a week.
¿I reprocha his partner que has pisado soil clean one foot sucio, their children have daubed un recién toilet cleaned up y una shelf with doors fibreglass, which tanto cost to clean up?
In the event that you sufra this “ deviation » pruebe, to be aware that there is nothing should exaggerate and que order and cleansing seguramente not should be ser primordiales in the family.
This desire harmless cleaning podría threatening their relaciones y family welfare.
Make nasty comments
« Underpants usados se leave with laundry. ”
« Quieres ponerte también tomorrow these socks usados »
The ¡« trapo letter is not left on the ground! ”
Si makes these comments his partner more times a day, to know that this will sacarlo of their boxes.
Of course, you don 't want to say anything bad, he only wants to getting everyone is in order.
Tal vez, if men supiesen this, women, for its part, would not make tantos comments.
Slurs and gossip
Some women are también slurs, gossip, but also in the conspiracy against someone.
Women are concentrated in relations, so I like to talk about the kind of things together quién, where, with whom, how and why.
To the best of each one of us is sometimes escapes un pequeño, harmless setup.
With my hand on my heart, this is almost all the women.
Por otro side, there are women chismosas of which are not controlled, whom I love chismorrear y do often scoff at all and resultan peligrosas para that surround them, especially in a team female labour.

How have evolved the price of travel since 1989
Until 1989 had in Czechoslovakia, only five state licensed travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea y Autoturist.
Travel agencies of the time vendían in the majority of cases viajes solo at the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (Democratic Republic German), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
Una positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when we could viajar to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime se tipped to the west and the journeys of czech tourists were then quite restringidos.
Una great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i also Checoeslovacos) is not enable them to viajar free and individually, even by the socialist countries.
Si un citizen quería viajar individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, it needed a letter of invitation, if not, the journey individual was not possible.
The travel agencies ofrecían in those days también viajes to the west, but one should the tail with a sack of sleep and pasar all night - or we hold « good » known in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so - called “ promesa of change ” que was the prerequisite for travel to the West, not been attached to the “ people políticamente poco reliable ”, which will not be able to travel at all.
The currency checoslovaca was not a currency freely convertible y, without a guarantee of change, was possible at the resources (the currency occidental viajar) for the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs pasaban sus vacaciones in their own country, which is why there was a large number of huts and summer houses, which the Czechs. on this habit todavía persiste.
The way to travel in the Czechs has suffered from the real revolution.
Until 1989 to us was not going more pasar holidays in the GDR o Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million trips on holiday to countries around the world.
Resulta nna great paradox, which now are not aware of the fact that the current favourite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not be viajar freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 1990s imposed visa - free travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which brought a huge oleada visits short - term, particularly at Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos, for a long time, has not seen enough of the trips to the west, the whole world wanted to verlo what at least for a moment.
Por example, sleeping in Paris the Czechs in parks in tents, as our income then not afforded us pagar un hotel or pensión.
Una characteristic of the Czechs of that time was the take with them (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save.
Otro important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the czech koruna, part of our turistas podían finally, after decades, freely buy currency occidental.
Our standard of living rising y through average wages, which around 1997 provocó un increase in demand for travel.
With the increasing demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 regularly, to prepare the travel usando connections charter, which made incredibly lower prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts por the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90 of the last century, because the Czechs viajaban sin visado in almost every developed country, except in the US, which simplificó even more nuestros viajes.
Otro interesting moment in the history of tourism pos - revolutionary sucedió ya in 2000, when it was organised, thanks to a huge demand, the first plane direct from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and it was to Thailand.
Since that year, todos years vuelos direct charter with turistas Czechs made países distant and hot. this winter ya se volará directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The countries exotic visit currently some 100,000 czech per year.
Otro interesting moment of this era, which symbolises nuestro development pos - revolutionary, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, US removed visas for tourists Czechs, with what our país pasó to be among the world 's most developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in its history, it has been more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and by primera vez in its history, have been spent on foreign travel more than $15 CZK por heads, including the costs in the place of residence.
General Assembly convened ordinaria para elect the President, which could end up again at a standstill.
For almost five months football czech is without presidente y is likely to be the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR), is not known, nor tras the convening of the next General Assembly extraordinary tendrá this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, it has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.
The same sin, there can be no votar siquiera para choose between the three candidates.
Interested parties to chair the football czech son Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta y Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek renunció to his office in June but not before calling his colleagues with the aim of finding a persona strong supiese ocuparse of football in the future.
Sin embargo, after the end of era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations Association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was made clear the September 16, when it had to ser elected the new President.
The delegates of the House General reunieron in vain to the house National Národní dům (), located in the district of praguense Smíchov, because the talks had blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.
No consensus was reached or who is in the General Assembly, tenía right to vote — only representatives or legal también delegates with full powers.
From that moment, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, backed también por the recommendation of the Institute of State and right, according to which the representation por plenos poderes is not possible.
Sin embargo, disputes over the electoral code siguen open.
More light on the situation could not shed nor the Executive Committee, in its meetings, ordinary o extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The view on the possibility of voting has changed a par times ya, but the worst point sigue siendo.
The question is: what is the easy in the third round para avoid deadlock?
The dispute revolves « about whether to proceed in line with the statutes or find another model, ” says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice - presidents of the FAČR, which, in the direction of the partnership, represents the football profesional.
Según the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate who tenga higher percentage of support in the federation, to which it will present su candidacy.
The region of Moravia is ready to go to a commitment to pueda win the candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both total federations.
The Bohemia, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations porcentuales, should have the majority of at least two - thirds.
« This quitaría, however, the sense of the two rounds before and deny por complete the concept of system bicameral », as well as Svoboda understands the objections of the morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and votar según applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, is also agree Tomaš Paclík, though supposedly the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all the candidates should be more Pelta.
I would like to see « votara to agree with the statutes ”.
« Para que did not invent any tontería about representatives as in the last General Assembly », says the owner of Victoria Plzen, postula por primera vez as candidate for accession conducts its observaciones principalmente against Pelta.
Pelta sigue siendo optimista.
Según él, in Nymburk se will decide on the new president and él believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate in a constructive manner.
« Todas passions are apaciguarán with the Party of today of our national team in the European Championship.
« Football volverá to be protagonista, and cooperate more comfortable » says the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates tiene more experience in management of football, both at a professional level and regional.
Rajchl is the more restrained.
I hope that « se to come to an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated. ”
« We are talking about the conflict between bohemios y Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to its own convenience. ”
« This may have resulted in a nuevo blockade of the General Assembly. ”
« Anyway, I hope that it will impose the common ”, said Rajchl.
Ya is not a very long time for todas the parties reach an agreement.
Some negotiations were que realizarse in Montenegro, but who puede saber until it begins the party si the football team will be entirely?
The special plane, in which tuvieron que viajar to Podgorica, among other vice presidents Dalibor Kucera y Rajchl, has not come up this morning by problemas técnicos in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transportar to part of the executive committee at the place where tendrá place the party of classification.
Quizas the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one to be held at the ministerial level, which, according to count, will be held this Wednesday.
To Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to incorporate the parties divided the organisation sporting more powerful of the country to se to reach agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of the football and también the next general assembly of the Central Committee of the Federation of the sport (checoslovaca ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to sport czech tras the financial problems of the home of Sazka lotteries.
Paclík fight for achieving the presidency because it does not find a most suitable candidate.
Si the head of footballers in Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly extraordinary knew the name of a candidate right that satisficiese todas sus ideas on the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or presentaría as a candidate to a tan relevante.
« Si a persona, would be fighting for it and not introduce me as a candidate for the elections. ”
Pero « until now we have not been able to find a persona, ” said Paclík para the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta y Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block Pelta, the winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR).
Paclík puntualiza que también, in case vencer evidently remain in the office of President solo until 2013, when they reach the turn of the Ordinary Assembly.
In that post, I would like to see an expert and a good manager que is not too closely related to the football events.
« Have already spoken to some people that I could tener into consideration. ”
« Para me was foolish oír some say that at this time, not even want to identify with the czech football. ”
« I would like to change that view », it adds.
What was supposed to be more embarrassing Paclík at this moment is the relationship of Pelta with the chairman of the Football Association Regional Pilsen Berbr Roman, a man with a past controversial, known outside the mundillo as a powerful lobista with ability to influence the vote of the delegates at the General Assembly.
Para Paclík is just not acceptable to Pelta sentado in the chair.
« If it wins, it would maintain the status vigente y nothing in football unchanged ”.
« With the support of Berbra, a business person ambitious, the football sacará even less » Paclík, said.
Also mentioned the fact that a few years ago, the name of Pelta was associated with a telefónica listens during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta salió go unpunished.
I do not know what « prestigio football podría traer victory of Pelta. ”
« Y ojos with what we will look at UEFA and FIFA », said Paclík, which also toma with some caution su statement previous « vendería Club Pilsen si se » Pelta becomes president.
In the case of winning elections Thursday, Paclík podría plantearse cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In this opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that terminó in a fiasco.
« Él (Pelta) would be the first that seguiría ».
« Is quite capable. ”
« I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation ».
Pero « not as manager of a partnership ”.
« Nor do I go the nose where I do not feel able » Paclík added, which in September, suscitó much attention to support the suspension of the Commission referees presidida por Ludek Macel, taken over by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that it was willing to manage the partnership.
Recurre to their management capabilities of private companies, since last summer, is also the director of the Pilsen, which with its support in May the triumph in the first division.
« My strength to change a few things in the area of football and contribute to its practice segura. ”
« Para reducir the influence of some pressure groups, which will probably tienden to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal, producing situaciones unpleasant, said Paclík sin hide their dislike of the President of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
The priorities also sería una of the consolidation of the relationship between the FAČR y the Olympic Committee of the Czech, with the help of which pressure on political leaders to set aside more money to the sport of taxes in the lottery.
« Is one of the key problems that should dedicate the new President. ”
« Si increase taxes on gambling, as advertised, political parties, to support their arguments, but, frankly, they need to tell us where it ends up todo this money ”, he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take account of su partnership with the Club Pilsner, even though he also says that the President of the FAČR must be “ non - partisan ”.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec y Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
« Is not ideal. ”
I do not see « pero sentido to give hypocritically my actions of the club of Pilsen to another person para then go there after un year and East ”, said Paclík.
Pelta prometió FAČR nuevos statutes to end the stalemate in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association uno of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, he promised that, if elected, would ensure that the FAČR tuviera unos nuevos statutes that sirvieran definitely a reason for solucionar, in the future, the controversies on the regulation of elections.
The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the conflict preelectoral podría move towards a solution today with the possible victoria 's football team.
Ya before the elections not made in September, Pelta prometió focus, if elected, precisely in the representation and to raise funds.
Decided to take part in the last minute at the last general assembly, which is why this delay of two months I could go either to defend and presentar, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football.
« People from all levels of football ocupa ya long ago and expected to know this Thursday, the new President. ”
« Sienten que the time has come for someone to manage the partnership ”, thinks the man who principalmente associated with the club, but which Jablonice trabajó in Sparta y in the executive committee of the partnership.
This is why, having por suficiente experience to manage the football Czech.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reinaba in the days of Ivan Hašek.
« Sadly, in the General Assembly in June were approved the statutes were not as perfectos as all pensaban. ”
Si « we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president ya since September » Pelta, warned.
Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association se usó to believe will be created para - won the delegates.
« Si presidente elect me, I take this as a challenge, personal y I am ready to respond in the event of this fail. ”
« Is a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist ” Pelta, says.
In addition, in theory, it tries to engage with his opponents.
Ya in the past had warned that it will be working with Henry veía Rajchl, respect por su training in law, being aware that their oponente sería their vicepresidente primer.
Ya had long without attacking Thomas Paclík quien, contrary to Pelta, left no títere with head.
« Takes more than a year in the world of football, and has already had some successes. ”
« Pero vergonzosos y sus attacks were many people quedó sorprendida por the electoral campaign. ”
« Por that many of them have doubts about su verdadero character », told his opositor Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements ya announced in September.
Su most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from competitions more low so superior.
This should be a showcase of promotion of football.
Also, try to « solucionar todos scandals that surgieron because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year. ”
« Immediately after I involve in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money to todo the football ”, said two months ago to the ČTK candidate 46 years.
Then prometió que su appointment as President of the football does not lead to any change personal staff.
« Will que first ascertain the tasks of each employee, he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, it is ruled by a nervousness understandable.

Swimming pools are more beautiful in Europe
Salto Blue
Julia Stanek por
Piscinas from a point of view, incredible suntuosos baths in Budapest: anyone who visite Europe can live su marvel blue, and after visiting the city or a walk, rest sus piernas weary in bubbly.
Un book shows where is the better welfare in the water.
When Iris Meder realizó un viaje research during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be in their luggage, a swimsuits shown.
Tumbada back sobre water, looked on the artistic leadership at the top, swimming toward angelotes of marble, that the expected on the edge of the pool y se asombraba before the pool deck modernist restaurada carefully.
He liked the bath, took note in their report card at the time of all the details interesting the style and the history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 piscinas in this way, and set out in his recent book “ Badefreuden »: swimming pools are covered in Munich, the historic palacios bath in the Black Forest, the “ construction of concrete » in Taunus.
Realizó « viaje por su baths most extraordinary of Middle Europe ” por 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectivamente in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This german 46 years is a true fan of the culture of the bath.
Does not want to have anything to do with the sport, says Meder, only the water is different.
Solo he annoyed that the fans bathing tengan que content with blue tiles y reeks of chlorine, while fans to run the fascinating pueden respirar olor forests of fir o hear blithe trinos birds in the park.
« Un day I wondered why the swimming pools tienen que ser tan siempre Ugly », says this inhabitant of Vienna.
« Comencé to collecting piscinas fine. ”
The surface of the water twice the architecture.
The chapoteo in the swimming pool y the ethereal oils of the sauna. the factor of welfare in swimming pools is so large because se served todos respects, according to Meder.
The manufacturer y si se effort, swimming pools are covered pueden ser un verdadero regalo para view: “ instead of soil, in the bath se tiene una superficie water. ”
« Por una parte is transparent, on the other hand refleja the beauty of the entire building. ”
Todo se twice ópticamente: the soaring vaults, tiles of colours, trampolines.
The book with photographs in miniature « Badefreuden » proporciona in 190 páginas data very interesting architecture, and the history of art in historical oases of welfare, but, above all, one might be tempted to jump to the blue.
Meder, collecting swimming pools discovers the prominent copies in its investigations in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent baths medicinal as the bloodbath Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years old, are the waters with nitrates in a singular cavidad kárstica (baths in cavities in Miskolc - Tapolca), as well as termas, whose son piscinas water alkali - manganese y se located in a building in the form of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many piscinas discovered in Switzerland and Austria ofrecen spectacular vistas: while the whole city pone eyes in the swimming pool techada of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the swimming pool outside a bloodbath in St. Antón: in the bathroom, and there is a turco ventana from which you can observar practice on the runways of ski.
The design, perhaps, most extraordinary expects to customers in the Längenfeld: the cathedral water Ötztal parece que un ovni has just landed in the Alps.
Three sources for open sube vapor in winter, while the mountains of Ötztal se raised in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
To Meder, collecting swimming pools, not invading the smell of chlorine in all the swimming pools.
Many baths termales smell of sulfur, the baths in Árpád Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague on diesel is so strong that the people have come to a bath sanitario.
The smell of viene medicinal waters contain bicarbonate y álcali y whose légamo se pega to the skin to enter into the swimming pool, a enjoyment of the welfare of a special way.
Iris Meder también se disappointed in a place in their search for places beautiful bathing, in para visitar piscinas discovered and baths of sun in the bath czech Luhatschowitz, he met with a terreno blocked.
The architect of the 1902 Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the abandoned building modernist rojo ventanas, white, and yellow, saw the grass grow between the tiles.
The decline in a pool contrarrestaba charming in the Black Forest: the palace Termal in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms tienen tres phases of construction tras, yes; not only can you discover neorománicos elements of times of its construction in 1844, if not un - style hall árabe Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernisation in 1995, the palace Termal is the favorite of the collecting swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural for the Black Forest.
« Tiene much merit merge different architectural styles in a unit tan fantastic » Meder, says.
In a palacio the immersion in the swimming pool termal apparently is not very important.

43% would advise against un bank at its known, 49% por solicitaría, upon reflection, cancel their account and change to another Institute.
The house 21 in Vienna
The flag trasladado
Por Ingeborg Wiensowski
Una history of architecture with swings and un happy ending, the flag of the exhibition austrian Brussels 1958 obtuvo premios, was in Vienna to un museum, was vacío y se ruin.
It is now reabre as a house of exhibitions.
The architecture of postgerra modern forms of passionate, clear, the halls of glass, curves valientes y new construction materials, which are typical of thinking on the technical progress, for which, the flag of the architect austrian Karl Schwanzer para the exhibition in Brussels is an example of 1958 right and known.
The flag of Schwanzer obtuvo then the Grand Prix of architecture largely on su lightly and floating construction steel - and - glass.
The construction is considered to have a milestone of contemporary architecture.
Did the architect tan también known that built the flag of Austria in this exhibition.
With its legendary torre four cylinders para MBW more building adjacent aplanado in Munich, became internationally known.
Su pabellón, designed as a construction temporal para exhibitions se lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten along to the station in the south of Vienna, reformó in 1962 and within se opened un Museum of the 20th century, is called the “ home 20 ”.
The building was adequate pero lacked the space and tecnología correspond to an museum; without any pared para hang art, not a good atmosphere.
Despite this utilizó until the contemporary art in Vienna un nuevo home.
The building is empty since 2001 and lapses increasingly.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformó the flag, now called it “ home 21 ” y se usará in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
The Tuesday afternoon there opened the museum belvedere, to which it belongs to the home, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein - arc, the new head of the gallery belvedere austrian since 2007, reached a nuevo start.
Husslein - Arco, Doctor in history of art with a considerable career, among other things, patinadora artistic sobre ice in his youth, later in carries Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum Director y founder of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectores monuments, provided public funds and patrocinadores privados y established its uso.
With the exception of contemporary art makes the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba Foundation 's Lisbon, there should be a cafeteria y una bookshop y also build a office building.
Strict, budget under control
Krischanitz was the best choice for doing so.
Not only because reformó of sensitive way the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, broader and won the competition, if not because studied with Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him un « important place huge and », in which included « almost all the weekend » exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which vanished with his traslado to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and easily.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was “ a devorador of energy ”, said Krischanitz.
Se changed the profile of the windows of the façade of glass, installed a glass with reforzado insulating glass fibre y se remplazó the glass ceiling por un safety glass.
Bridges térmicos y the beams of steel reforzaron o remplazaron y the roofs of asbestos are rehabilitaron.
Two sótanos se used to the new uso, a panel of light declined between the house and the street proporciona lighting, a bridge sirve para enter the building almost nuevo, but still the flag of Schwanzer.
The doors permanecen external originales, the house is in pintada tonos old species of true mahogany y protegida against oxidación.
Y the cinema is exactly as it was before.
Y todo this with a strict control of the office of monuments and un low budget.
« Often tenía que find material that is good, cheap and también preferred to the office of protection of monuments », says Krischanitz y warns of a suelo áspero in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reformas, the building was still more flexible and lighter.
The flag « que vino of Brussels ” has been difficult, said recently, a Krischanitz típica « appearance by chance in the history of the town. ”
Una architecture as well as being “ siempre in all the wrong ” y por « why I want to raise awareness appropriate ”.
In this case, the house is not 21 in the wrong place, has happened un stroke of luck urbanístico. the utterly nuevo y planeado « district of the station central ”, with viviendas y oficinas, sits alongside the Garten Schweizer.
Y tal vez suceda otro stroke of luck: the house 21 podría recibir un refuerzo of another building Krischanitz, because the collecting Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of art temporal berlin y, as oye, negotiate with the city sobre un place vecino in Garten Schweizer.

The threat is specific
Tras the discovery of “ the cell of Zwickau », the turkish media have doubts about the state of german law.
Un periódico talk of a “ ideology sangrienta » que vuelve to reavivarse.
The killings of eight pequeños entrepreneurs trucos y greek between 2001 and 2006 should un trasfondo of the extreme right.
In Turkey and the german people of turkish origin se has reacted with fears and our concerns before this news.
Para many Germans of turkish origin regresa un ghost se believed died long ago, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, had not happened at more episodes of violence to him right - wing against turcos.
However, it has never been questioned the fact that in Germany is xenofobia.
The network ultraderechista discovered revela una magnitude whose size were not, and much less, predictable.
« ¿Vuelve to reavivarse ideology sangrienta? ”, the internet por titula edition in the turkish newspaper « Haberturk ».
The newspaper “ Sabah » resalta por that uno of the perpetrators of the crime was an informer for the Federal Office for defense of the constitution and worried about que the german authorities may be involved in the pantanal ultraderechista.
The turkish community in Germany reaccionó sensibly, the weekend recordó to victims of racist violence with a vigilia to the door of Brandenburg.
Two weeks earlier, the turkish community in Berlin, along with german politicians and turcos reflexionaron in a formal act of the 50th anniversary of the agreement turco - german.
The co - existence se puso on the scene with gaudy colours, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some turkish media like a slap in the face: “ the gift German by the 50th anniversary », says the title of an article in the platform turca internet « Haber X ”, meaning the background of the chain of killings.
The german “ Hürriyet » tampoco insists on drawing this mental connection.
« Begins to stink », says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.

In the internet forums of Germans from turca, the behaviour of the police and su posterior éxito in searches se discussed very critically.
The authors are amazed that the german authorities have not sought long before sospechosos in the circle of the ultra - right.

« Internal peace of Germany heavily dependent on the quality of the clarification and of the adequacy of the penalty to the network ”, written “ Selen ».
Which means that if internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln Solingen y se clarified in ninety years.

The bank scandal of Lake Zurich
The bank more risky in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis, and since then it slid from one crisis to the next.
Now runs a German.
Seguro que Axel Weber not had thought.
After his spectacular partida of the summit of the federal bank, in July was known que in 2013 would start in a new, almost equally spectacular trabajo: chairman of the Council 's administrative big swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative paso in his career.
Axel Weber happy públicamente, praises Switzerland for su beauty and to the UBS por su recién acquired solidez y slipped observaciones friendly noises about sus future colleagues.
The USB « has achieved a revitalización ».
« I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger y Oswald Grübel ».
In September quedó clear that all sería totalmente different.
Un operador financial USB in London avoided todos security systems of the bank and he let down 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director - general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Council 's administrative USB se considered since then also tocado, and all preguntaron: when is Axel Weber?
Que se known Weber will advise the bank since February 2012.
Y se take over the presidency of the Council administration in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard to Axel Weber.
It is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counsel and has had a periodo adaptation seguramente necessary.
Of blow was in charge of the strategy of a bank, who has just returned to test que deserves the title “ the largest bank in the scandal of Europe ” for some time.
Por una parte, USB is enormous, until recently, was the largest manager of global goods, and, on the other hand, for years, slides a scandal to the next.
Nothing, so we think, it saves the past tan orgulloso swiss bank.
The beginning of the financial crisis.
The USB tuvo una fame excellent until 2007.
The image of the administrator of goods suizo discreet and sólido, but also cunning, combined with ambitious targets, I also wanted to ser un large numbers in investment banks.
Por una parte, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from clients wealthy que any other bank in the world.
Y por otra parte moved as investment bank in the league of big banks in the world.
This impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker y posterior profesor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: “ First my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank. ”
« From today 's point of view, one wonders: how could be wrong? ”
It was a big mistake.
In the year 2007 salió to light that something went very wrong in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director - General, which until then it was regarded as a banker - very intelligent, resigned sorprendentemente.
A few months later, it sospechó right.
The Fund 's investment bank embarked in losses with titles of high - risk and tuvo que repay billions.
Para saddled with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
This para found investors, of course, that some look with contempt until shortly before: a state - owned fund Asia and opaco of Singapore, and a state - owned fund árabe, so discreet, who never had heard su name.
This was only the first blow.
In April 2008, worsened.
The bank tuvo que declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, President of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second highest - paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, he continued the catastrophe, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS se found in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and tuvo rescatada por que ser the state.
The national bank bought valores problemáticos to UBS por many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave seis billions of francs per un obligatoriamente convertible bond, it is becoming copropietaria of the bank.
Toda Switzerland was affected, it said, it was this for un país pequeño, if taking in large banks tan.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007, it was more than five times higher than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
« We cannot go back to rescue the UBS », said Geiger, an expert in banking.
The first unió disaster is the second.
Pocos months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and se showed willing to hand over data of well - heeled customers, which may have disappointed taxes, with the help of the bank.
In addition, adopted a number of 780 billions of dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from this business with a compensation for pago.
With that, the UBS confessed to more or less have helped in the tax fraud.
Something that had been simultáneamente perdió su always capital in the competition for customers ricos: the glow of discretion.
Tras the scandal, the secret of the swiss bank ya is not the same.
This was followed by the resignation of President of the Management Board and the President of the European Council.
Y the exodus of the funds of clients.
In this way, in a few months, the bank perdió su credibility in their two sectors: plants in investment banking by the erroneous and speculation in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
Y fair when they come back to be a little calmer, just when people thought the UBS que volvía to achieve this, it is happening this unhappy history of the operator, a trader individual defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank will realise that something was wrong.
Y se unveiled, apparently, this is still not working well with the management of risk in investment banking.
With the case « Adoboli se says that controls risk have changed too little ”, says Martin thank, a professor of economics and finance at the Corporation Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large bank german also is sure: “ the problem of the UBS is that it dominates the controls. ”
Por what emerged the idea of caution, with which the bankers suizos se presentaban for some time, be the guardians of the world 's greatest assets: no risk too great, security, on the other hand, the money quiere quebrar on the other side of the Republic Alpine.
Deposits for the safety of swiss banks were the symbol of the reliability and unflinching, y Sprüngli Lindt chocolate genuine.
The heart of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of strong private bank suizo, only is a bit higher.
The situation is classic.
The bank has su sede principal in the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which runs from the main season directly to the Lake Zurich, embodied by the summits of snow covered in the swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentosos, rents son unos the highest in Europe.
These include jewellery as Tiffany 's in business tradicionales suizos as the confectionery Sprüngli.
Residen here for years, the swiss banks: from the national bank, via the palace of Credit Suisse, until the elitarios private banks as Julius Bär.
Se comes into the room of receipt of the UBS through a revolving pesada puerta.
Inside, the walls are revestidas of marble, in large sillones leather, along with the logo of the bank is a great sign para indicate “ security. ”
The UBS sabe what the customer is looking for here: security.
The two big swiss banks, Credit Suisse, UBS y at some point have shifted the idea of big swiss bank, or have betrayed, like the president of a small private bank suizo.
Prefiere not read his name in the paper, after all, like all bankers suizos too, with the business of both big banks.
The UBS se has become too big, believes, mostly in investment banking, where the Anglo - saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
« Y se used for a long time in the customs of the Anglo - saxons. ”
In fact, the UBS investment banking changed the Anglo - Saxon, tabled his primera large gain and then came the disaster, no entity european financial tanto had lost money in the jungle of the high risk as the big swiss bank.
The 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious.
« Wednesday that the coalition government of the tiny country of seven million decided to rescue the largest exercise in the history of their nation, ” writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book “ Der Crash - UBS » (“ the crash of the UBS » in Spanish).
Politicians granted to 68 billion francs and thousands of approximately 45 billion to save the large bank of bankruptcy.
¿You do?
Se talks with bankers suizos, that 's how the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three big swiss banks are blending a powerful consortium.
Surge un bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
What sirvió para por que the two different banks precursores of UBS se but: a bank rico pero sleeping with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and una internationalisation poorest pero stronger.
Suddenly, the investment banks internacionalizados arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could make rodar una great bicycle financial.
There are two names relacionados with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the Association of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then the president of the administrative board.
« Siempre pensé Wuffli y que Ospel were a team » perfecto, says the banking expert Hans Geiger.
« Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, which meant a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive que got up from the learning in the bank until the summit. ”
Finally, Ospel se Wuffli trusted what they told them.
In the end, y Wuffli committed probablemente un fatal error: “ Pensó que sus models were a realidad » Geiger, says.
« Is a tragic one. ”
Trágico, perhaps.
It is clear: the attempt came before the case.
The employees of the UBS se remember clearly meetings managers, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repetía the same slogan: lower the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The bank was the american investment bank, the world 's most powerful.
Leading the “ League Tables », the rankings which then documentaban the success of the banks.
The UBS quería be at the summit.
Some of the steps he salieron well.
In the operations of currency and in the negotiation of action was at the top.
Sin embargo, advisers companies responsible pusieron highlighted a punto weak: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking « fixed income ” compensation, there is a huge amount to the big banks.
The UBS tiene vacíos mortgage products in the United States.
Para fill the gaps, the UBS started a venture that he was almost cost existence.
Ávidos growth, invested tanto the same bank as one of its high - risk funds created american investment in high - risk.
Se transformó into a machine poderosa para titularizar mortgage loans and american venderlos then, keeping certain risks.
Y también, as other banks sought the fall for a long time.
« In the summer of 2007, as the american housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there ”, said Geiger, an expert in banking.
Large tan the euphoria, so profunda the fall.
Un manager tuvo que go, since the attempt to regulate resultó more complicated than expected.
The UBS se became seats proyectables y insecure son until today.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a trabajo almost impossible.
Must find a strategy for a bank, in which all the business models are logical perdidos.
Geiger, an expert on banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, to focus on the administration of goods, return to the roots suizas.
The bank does not want to go so far (yet).
Pero investment banking must reduce much, it is clear now.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In reality, they only pensó in the italian - swiss of 51 years as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank separó sorprendentemente of his predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed: it should pass permanently business from UBS, told the bank in Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti quiere back to the investment bank to their state in the mid - 1990s.
Suprime 500 jobs.
Pero this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
¿Who is it?
¿With what quiere make money?
These are the questions that seguro se does Axel Weber today.
So far, only going to say it will be looking for a vivienda with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

This is not so much a book about what ocurrió explains, as “ a book about how it happened » concerning about “ sentimientos, impressions and experiences, and states of humor. ”
« The beauty and the pain of the battle « combines experience in times of war more or less 20 men and women ordinarias, on both sides of the war, from colegialas y botánicos to escaladores, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some were turned into prisoners of war, otherwise they will lose sus members will be crazy o die.
Sus vidas parpadean here as velas votivas lit in a church; nuevos se added to the mix and others apagan.
The book by Mr Englund is a deviation from the history books standard.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the first war world has scarcely was the disastrous trench warfare on the western front.
« The beauty and the pain of the battle ” se moves of expertly through other teatros of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern, Mesopotamia, Africa 's east.
The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives; one pasa Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tse - tse son un problema intractable.
Éste Paper is a touching, almost from the start.
The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina que reeks of cordita.
When the fire artillery se oye in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, te quedas o huyes?
Of all forms ¿quién viene?
Almost no one understands what is happening, even by qué tiene que se fight this war.
« Lack of facts ”, notes Mr Englund, “ has rellenado with conjectures, guesses, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of the conspiracy, dreams, pesadillas y rumores ».
« The beauty and the pain of the battle ” sigue individuals as Florence Farmborough, an english nurse in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor german fleet of the high seas.
Sus se stories have been largely of memoirs, letters and otro material already publicado earlier.
The explanations of their lives pueden ser terrifying o moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, details perdidos, Mr Englund.
Many of them are about hardship and make do with what we have.
About telling the story of a schoolgirl german says: “ Sucedáneos everywhere sucedáneos ».
« Sucedáneo coffee, aluminium false, rubber imitation, vendas paper, buttons of wood. ”
Still talking about food sucedánea in Germany.
Described as “ meat made from rice broth y prensado in fat carnero rematado (and with a bone false made of wood); tabaco fact roots and peladuras potatoes secas; zapatos sole » wood.
There is, notes, “ 837 sustitutos permitidos meat in the production of sausages, 511 sustitutos coffee registrados ».
Some stories are about the honour and value.
Un american reconoce su propio momentum towards the savagery y says about the war: “ Sientes que, after all, this is what the men are conceived and not for sentarse in armchairs with a cigarette un y whisky, the newspaper of the evening or un bestseller, and to claim that this veneer significa civilisation and that there is not a barbaric behind this pechera almidonada y tachonada. ”
In return a soldado british realise that probably will die, and that no one will notice o will take care of.
« Una vez que se uno resigna thinking sacrificed, one would like to think that podría ocurrir before the public ”, he writes.
On the other hand, is horribly parecido « a condemned man siendo strangled in secret ».
Otras observaciones son about an old Europe disappearing, and on new types of terror.
« The conflict has increasingly become a competition economics, ” writes Mr Englund, “ a war between factories ».
Refleja the arrival of what he called a “ nueva species in the bestiario 's new: the mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with ropas good clothing que implements its carnage while sitting behind a desk ».
People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to get a disease venérea prostitutes as a way of avoiding the service in the front.
The more grotesque « expression of this can be seen in the trade of pus gonocócico, that the soldiers are buying and embadurnan with their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital », writes.
Those who are really desperate « we looking sobre sus ojos, which often leads to blindness for life. ”
In this translation of the Swede Peter made by Gates, the prose of Mr Englund ágil pero not extravagant, is perfectly suited to her work as a human being.
In dozens of small scenes refleja the way in which the war unleashed forces to “ exceptionally uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, revolution social, hatred religioso ».
People start ask why sus leaders are doing to combat.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, as the Great War and the memory of a modern Paul Fussell, or novelas as novedad in the face of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of comprehensive histories.
The volume of Mr Englund se une panteón poco a conventional.
Su book has uno end of the most devastating puedo recordar in a non - fiction.
Not revelaré.
Pero is as if it had come from his book, torn between tus fingers of this page dramatis personae, and had quemado with a match.
Tras un paso false previo, an assault to the minute planeado
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.
Se chose the night from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more vacío.
The operation was kept secret at salvo para unos pocos oficiales high - ranking officers, saying initially that others were uniéndose to an exercise.
The detective Raymond W. Kelly was in the centre, their presence subrayaba how the operation was plagaba challenges ahead for the Police Department.
They could not repetirse episodes of weeks recientes, such as spraying of espray pimienta sobre demonstrators, in violation of the rules of the department and creating a tormenta sympathy pública towards “ okupas ».
Y por that the police raid on a clear Zuccotti Park of protestors reveló after two weeks of planning and training.
The players had prepared viendo as they had developed the occupations in other cities.
Un simulacro of major catastrophe was taking place on Randalls Island, with an looking towards Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so - called training of disorder - counter - terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilise to a great many police officers - in order to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last sitting training was on the evening of Monday, on the side of Manhattan of the River East.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the “ last minute ”, said someone familiar with the orders, which is refirieron mission solo “ as an exercise of these rights. ”
The few « polis que know that were called on to this, we were told that was to enter Zuccotti Park », said the person, who spoke anonymously.
The only people who « sabían que went to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department. ”
Una razón para secrecy was a lesson learnt by the city.
On 14 October, some agents quisieron clearing the park, but desistieron when hundreds of demonstrators surgieron before time after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents of several unidades policiales, including special forces around the local district - dozens of agents mobile usually solían flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.
Mr Kelly said that many people, including those who travel on a daily basis to work, had been bounced back and forth the park during the day, making 1 p. m. a good hour to enter.
« It was appropriate to do so when it would be the lowest number of people in the park ”, he said.
Trucks of the unity emergency service with outbreaks and loudspeakers se congregaban at the junction of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before leaving.
The lights and the messages pregrabados que retumbaban from the loudspeakers parecieron intimidate many demonstrators.
The agents of Community Affairs were the park with its cortavientos clear blue, many protesters simplemente recogieron sus words, and we were.
Was not touched upon any tienda until 1: 45 a. m., the police said, giving the demonstrators to take their pertenencias.
Otros teams of players were vistos reuniéndose on the perimeter para enter si se needed to make arrests in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that it was for su seguridad.
Pero many journalists told me they were vieran tried to prevent the police go into action in the park, and that have been treated rudely por agents.
Mr Browne said that mobile units of television on Church Street, along the edge of the park occidental, they were able to capture images.
As the police are moving towards the west through the dense thicket of personal effects of demonstrators, including baggage and bags of waste of paper and plastic packed clothes, teams of the Department of cleansing followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move se were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet after poco tiempo.
Un core group of demonstrators tomó posiciones near the area of the camp 's kitchen, close to the centre of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came para arrestarlos methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp se candaron between them by the arms.
Two people y se tied to árboles, said Mr Kelly.
The emergency service officials were called to cut the locks.
Not made arrests in the park until about 3: 30 a. m., said Mr Kelly.
The operation to remove was complete unos 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said that unas 142 personas, were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were on « disruption of public order and resistencia to the authority ”, he said.
The highest - ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the officer superior uniformado in the department.
T. Phil Pulaski, the department 's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while was present, “ was not directing operations ”, said Mr. Browne
Un segundo group of players expected along the eastern side of Broadway, between the streets Liberty and Cedar, in case they had to go.
Se rose up barricades in the streets Cortlandt, a block to the north of the park, and on the street Pine, a block to the south.
From those positions, was the police extending beyond the perimeter of the park Zuccotti.
At one point, a number of officers, many of them with shields, were vistos pushing people into outside.
There were some 28 people in the north.
Some of the action louder of the night, there was the south of the park.
Around 5 a. m., south of the street Pine, a demonstrator saltó sobre the bonnet of a police car, and others are being vio quitando the air of the wheels of a police van.
At a given moment in time, a piece of contrachapado salió volando from the crowd.
In the end, an actor and demonstrators were hospitalized.
The union workers will require support to the city by the redundancies
The union representa hundreds of workers to support school than perdieron sus jobs last month planea sued the city on Wednesday, claiming that the layoffs were unnecessary and discrimination because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the latest weapon at the disposal of the trade union, District municipal 37, in its effort to revocar redundancies.
Seiscientos setenta y two assistants from the school, the coordinators of parents and otros employees who were among the worst paid in the city perdieron su trabajo on October 7, in a movement that union leaders have described as a revenge política por su refusal to allow, last spring, the access by the city to a fund for health care by groups of work to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a hearing in the city last month, the director of education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the layoffs were a parte budget approved in June.
Un member of the Council contraatacó saying that nothing in the budget specified that the staff members to support would be made redundant.
Officials of the borough 37 presentaron said that the complaint por writing to the Department of Education, warning that it would be called, will hold a news conference Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand, in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Demand will include Mr. Walcott y at the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight trabajadores redundant and claimants, all of them women or black latin, like the majority of the assistants who perdieron sus jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city 's Law Department, said that the city had not seen the demand, and for so could not comment on specific allegations sus.
Según un draft demand obtenido por the New York Times, the union se has focused on the number of redundancies in schools pobres areas of the city to support a reclamación por trato unfair, saying that the schools pobres perdieron more assistants, since they were insufficiently subvencionados chronically.
Se señala que si well there was no redundancies in Staten Island and unos pocos redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side o TriBeCa, 17 assistants school perdieron sus jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were made redundant in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Teniendo account of the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of students viven in poverty, the complaint says, “ this is not a quarter of parents wealthy que puedan recaudar funds to meet the budget deficit ».
P. D. 's budget in a district 36 redujo por 3.26% this year, and also perdió money when the city changed the way in which estimated the extra funding for every VRT on student pobre in schools.
The union también says that the directors of secondary schools pueden have been deceived by the language in a memorandum that authorizes the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.
The memorandum utilizaba the word “ surplus' para describe the action, despite the fact that “ surplus' describes more often the act of moving to a master of the payroll for a school to a bag of work, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
« Here y seis coordinators to parents who were made redundant », says the draft of the complaint, “ and not only in surplus'.
Mission terminada, Congress preparado para to reach an agreement on Libya
Parece que finally republicanos y Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya.
Todo what was needed was for the rebellion tuviera éxito, which the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed and the involvement of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to consider a va resolución, sponsored by the President John Kerry (Christian por Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican Arizona por) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut, applauding the Libyans por su successful rebelión y troops from the U. S. for their « valentía ».
« This resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya, to rebuild their country and », said Kerry.
« Is a statement of bipartisan support para sus democratic aspirations. ”
The talk can parecer harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties se peleaban among themselves and with the White House sobre the wording of a series of resolutions that approve or reject the role of the military in the US in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presentaron resolución que una authorizing the limited use of military forces of the US in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and came to be put to the vote in the Senate.
Pero on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rechazó una measure that would have recortado funds for american operations in Libya.
That left the mission of the US in a kind of legislative purgatorio - with Congress enough irritating to criticise the approach of Obama 's mission, but not as angry as to actually segar grass beneath their feet.
Then, the indecision of Congress were surpassed in the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission terminó oficialmente on 31 October.
Now the Senate podría be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs « congratulates the people of Libya by su tremendo courage and extraordinary resistencia para freed themselves' y « pays tribute to the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its partners in the coalition that participaron in operations for military proteger to the people of Libya by extraordinary courage y su profesionalidad ».
The resolution also « declares the national interest of the United States to a successful and irreversible transición towards democracy in Libya. ”
¿Won the new measure the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or divided lawmakers as it did the bill in June?
The final version was rejected by Senator Richard G. place (Indiana), the main republicano of the committee.
The spokesman, said Monday that had not seen todavía the final version of the new draft law.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is to vote this week on una constitutional amendment demanding a balanced presupuesto, a priority legislative almost all Republicans in Congress y some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican por Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment sobre the budget or any other subject que actually achieves a votación of the entire House in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Otros legislators have not been successful so far to make their amendments to the House, but not for lack of trying.
The Goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments have introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same project is propone tanto in the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versiones of the amendment to the budget balance tan solo in the House, and another puñado que « control federal spending. ”
Some of these projects of law also son identical, but give their patrocinadores - especially republicanos novatos seeking refinar que sus resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were “ authors' of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required que tanto the House and the Senate votaran una of a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senadores votaron in favour of a resolution non - binding supports the idea of the amendment.
Beyond the Budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while Representative José E. serrano (Christian por nueva York quitar), wants the two - term limit on presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Christian por Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics.
Una amendment banning gay marriage is a proposal perenne, as well as one that prohíbe burning flags.
Some legislators also quieren permitir the cancellation of federal laws si son rechazadas por two thirds of the states.
Glowing tan has been the Member for proposing amendments, they are moving at a faster rate than in previous years.
In Congress, lawmakers 111º propusieron 77 changes, and presentaron 66 in the 110º.
The pace is unacceptable in comparison with the 1990 's, when members presentaban regularmente more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures supplied by the library of the Senate.
Pero have not had much more success as to what it is now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by the Congress in 1789.
« Golpeada pero not defeated, ” Giffords speaks in his first tv interview since the shooting
Ten months after a pistolero fired him to quemarropa in an act seek help from Tucson 's constituent, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Christian por Arizona) appeared on national television Monday evening, sang accompanied by the melody of Broadway « the sun saldrá tomorrow ” y recuperarse said it wanted more of what I wanted to regresar to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News « 20 / 20, ” with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form oraciones y needed help to walk.
The programme documented su difficult path back to the damage caused by a bullet the fractured her skull and perforó the left side of her brain, which I from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned por sorpresa to the House to cast their vote triunfante in the agreement of the ceiling on debt.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six and injured 13, Giffords sonrió, rio y sang - and described its recuperación as “ difficult ”.
When Sawyer asked how it feels, Giffords, 41 years, responded: “ Bastante well ”.
The interview with Giffords and su husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special programme of “ 20 / 20 ” a one - hour, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the couple 's new book, “ Gabby: a history of courage and hope. ”
The special programme explored the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
Videos recorded por Kelly in the first few weeks, is seen in his hospital bed, with the head shave y una long scar in the midst of its front.
Extradition can only maintain one o two fingers erguidos, while her husband encouraged the.
Months later, you see Giffords sentada in a wheelchair while therapists taught him how to make sencillas actions.
Un movement.
Un fruncimiento of the lips.
Y then, its first palabra: “ what ».
In a few days, Giffords pronunció otra palabra - “ tostada », an application for a change in its menu of breakfast.
Videos disseminated by the NBC show that the music played a role in the recovery of Giffords: we have the congresswoman singing along with therapists songs « Girls Just Wanna have Fun » of Cyndi Lauper y « Free Falling » Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, two hours of therapy todos days, said he does not remember the day about to fire.
Su husband said he was leyéndole to Giffords un newspaper article sobre the murder of 12 March when she stopped para preguntar por primera vez about the six that had died in the incident.
The pistolero sospechoso, Jared Lee Loughner, was detained in a prison in Missouri y is being - medicated por force while awaiting trial.
« Mucha people hands, said Giffords to Sawyer.
« Duro, hard, very hard. ”
Kelly told Sawyer que at a time of the recovery of his wife, she said: “ I was defeated. ”
« So, I said, “ Gabby, you have been defeated, ” said Kelly ».
« Only has been hit.
Y vas to come out of this, and vas to recuperarte y vas to return with more force than ever. ”
Troops being felt more shame that respeto
The event was a display of Wall Street recaudó millions of dollars to the veterans home sin in New York.
Kid Rock sang una Ballad sobre powerlessness, the frustration and the loss.
At that point, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed in their posts around him.
The crowd of label is puso on their feet and clapped.
« Men and women were regarded as heroes ”, said David Saltzman, who organizó fundraising in the spring.
Un oficial military high - ranking in the show, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way.
The « showed as a kind of children orphaned », the officer wrote in an e - mail.
I am sure that the organisers tenían good intentions.
Que se ran.
Pero was not respeto, really, it was a pity.
The contradictory impressions starkly illustrate the difficult relationship que se has taken hold of the military and un - american público often distant, sometimes adorador.
Se prodiga troops with commended for their sacrificios.
Pero praise tiene un precio, say the service members.
The public increasingly acts as if he gave those pena uniformados.
« We are not suffering at all, ” said Brigadier - General B. sean MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan toward partirá pronto.
Pero « parece que the only way that some people show their support is to undertake to us in the role of souls helpless. ”
The issue is a subject very sensitive to the military leaders, who do not want parecer ungrateful o disagree with the public to which sirven.
También se realize that the anger faced by the troops that regresaron in recent years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the talks on the pity se carried out in silence and in private between the war veterans.
After their two children regresaron of combat with the Marine Corps, Colonel Mark retirado Cancian them warned that people apart from the military would consider their servicio from two perspectives.
Some are mirarían with a feeling of fear because it pitted against the insurgents and viajaron to exotic places.
Otros preguntarían si se there be a “ veterano angry y violento below the surface, said » Cancian, who fought in Iraq and regresó work to the high level of government in Washington.
During your job search, he said, he felt some interviewers had asked him que si sutilmente sería capable of withstanding under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat.
« When you talk about your servicio, you need to deal with the negative image », recalled Cancian contándoselo to their children.
The military surge concerns, in part, of the american indifference towards the wars.
The achievements in the field is rara vez elected to the parte praised for a country that has poca familiarity with the military and ve pocos direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
« We, as a nation, are no longer valoramos heroism military in ways that were quite common in the Second World War ”, said Lieutenant retired general David Barno, who commanded troops of the US in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and are focused largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops son reconocidas por que the number of tours have endured, the number of friends who have lost their job or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing an increasing pressure for an end to the violation
This week, a hearing to decide whether historic 28 men and women have un case against the army on its supuesta pasividad to the violation.
Si no, hundreds of plaintiffs are now organising to the next.
Soldier first Elizabeth Lyman tenía 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy, the night in which he says that she was raped by a colleague.
Octubre it was 2008, and is heading back to their barracks in the air base Miramar, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when it was found with a colleague who had a paquete 12 cans of beer.
Él asked whether podía unirse to it in your room para tomar una Cup.
« Sonó una señal alarm », Lyman said.
Sin embargo, the native of Texas left aside their preocupación.
Pensé, 19, has not.
« Is Texas », says.
« Ojalá had listened to my instincts. ”
In the few minutes of entering the room Lyman, the man behind, I approached por tirándola downwards and violándola, he claims.
This week, the 18 November, Lyman y otros 27 members of military personnel current and former looking forward to a court decision in a trial historic place in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand that tienen brought against former defence Robert Gates and su predecesor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presentada in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D. C., the implied demand initially to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claim they were violados o attacked sexualmente por sus colleagues, and that the army failed to investigate, process, or justice right after the alleged assault.
Burke says he is going for the top brass of the military, because the problem starts with them.
« The army is a structure from the top to the bottom up ”, he says.
« ¿Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? high command. ”
Burke también says that since February, got in touch with her nearly 400 supervivientes more, many of which could parte of future demand.
Su strategy: instead of piling up to all the plaintiffs in this case, putting todos eggs in one basket, so to speak, is going to present varios cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure up.
The team of the defence for the Department of Defense, led by the federal tax Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained por Newsweek, detailing the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued for soldados current or former por injuries sustained in the armed forces.
Por una sentencia Supreme Court 's 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is responsible for the damage suffered by the personnel on active service.
« Damage alleged son parte of military service of the plaintiffs », according to the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to make comments for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While the women still is oficialmente prohibido servir in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rara vez tienen clear lines.
Tanto in Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of women are playing soldado papeles increasingly important, especially for reaching out to the local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldado have died and two - thirds of them in situations of battle.
It is time that the Army also se modernizes, says Burke.
It is not alone in your struggle, and three others demands are in place, as well as the suya.
At the Yale Law School, the clinical services legal veteranos is preparing a case against the four main military academies supuestamente promover un Environment misogynistic.
Por otra parte, the for - profit ánimo Vietnam Veterans of America is making una demand against the army which focuses on the diagnosis of “ trastorno personality » allocated to the rape victims in order to give them the high service - a suceso common, according to activists, like Anu Bhagwati of the network of action of women in service, a human rights group.
Su group tabled a demand in December against the administration of veterans, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way it handled the complaints of benefits to the people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Se have presented nueve proyectos law separado in Congress by parte a mixture of senators and bipartisan representantes, by proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3.158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the prevention of aggression Sexual y respuesta the Department of Defense.
Sin embargo, the assaults are significantly under reported, and by our own estimates of the Pentagon, which figure in approximately 13.5% of the 19 000 incidents ladies que se produjeron that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the indices of prosecution: in 2010, a 20 percent of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that of the justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, illustrates the attacks as only the first in a series with trauma.
In the case of Lyman, denounced any breach of the military police less than an hour after it had happened.
That night, he says, will be asked to count the details of her rape 11 times different to a crowd of police officers, medical, and commanders.
She sometió a kit to rape, and the blood of his attacker - a court in his arm - was found dead in his bed.
Seis months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which we asked him about that had relaciones sexuales with its novio on the day of the attack.
Seis personas declared as witnesses personality on behalf of the alleged copyright, which was eventually acquitted.
« Recuerdo on the day that he read the verdict », Lyman said.
« I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room. ”
« I make in the unity of psychiatry, and when I left, I remember that I said to my oficial command, “ this was not part of his trial. that was my trial ”.
Lyman to se ordered him visitar a psychiatrist military, which finally diagnosed with un trastorno of personality, what did not fit for the service.
In January of 2010 was dispensed of service under términos less - that - honorable, what prevents him from recibir any benefit.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman y sus fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington law faculty.
Sin embargo, he points out, “ in my opinion, they should be able to continue. ”
What is standing between them and a veredicto is this doctrine that has been criticized since por primera vez.
I have been a critical permanente of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades by behind porque does not have the same incentive and deterrence that plantea responsibility.
Y adds: “ the odds are heavily against them … pero it is important for them to try. ”
The only change when the good people is ready to fight.
Si the hearing is not on su path, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, it will put the queue to its other hundreds of complainants in order to future cases.
« Vamos to continue the fight against the army on this issue until the reform is produzca », says.
« O until we muramos, what happens primero.
The walls tienen ojos: how researchers are studying te on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another tipo aireaba que sus puntos sight of anti - immigration in line.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted having conducted a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, we faced its first public judicial hearing.
While Breivik puede have acted alone, was far from being solo in cyberspace: he spent most of the time that precedió his attack in front of their computers, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support groups right on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers querían saber more about these people.
Pero, how do you find them?
Easy - only tienes que go on Facebook.
« We realised that it was not too hard to get them ”, says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report sobre populism digital european studies centre british DEMOS.
The alijo of personal information, Facebook is so enciclopédico, says Bartlett, which the researchers simplemente utilizar the tool publicity for determining their desired demographic characteristics with precision scientific - the way that sellers have been using for years.
The team of Bartlett found half a million fan of right - wing groups across Europe, and then I flew announcements, but instead of vincularles to a new band o producto diet, the announcements urging users to complete a survey that preguntaba sobre su educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about su propio future.
To get through Facebook, Bartlett y sus colleagues were able to study to more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 countries in Europe — all without salir of the office.
« Is a whole new way of making a research ”, says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely sorprendentes: the supporters in line, right - wing groups tienden to be young men and angry about immigration.
Sin embargo, in a sort of turn, “ those who combine their activism in line with the activism outside line are more reasonable, more democratic, and less fierce que those quedan behind the computer screen ».
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook se is turning into a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the place to study everything, from health problems of trends sociales tal expressed in the “ I like to ”, messages on the walls and updates of state.
With more than 800 million active users, adding un promedio three piezas content per day, the “ supernova of data ” Facebook is creating a boom in the research, boosting the number of jobs that academics with the name of the site in the title until almost 800% in the last five years.
Para some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that te permite study to people who could not acercarte with a file on the street.
« Before, when intentabas encuestar people with the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify. ”
« Tendrías que go through of the party, and they would never te permitirían the access ”, says Bartlett.
« Facebook removes todo - vas to them directly. ”
Otros say that the site podría proporcionar una way to identify and address the health problems.
Un recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and sus colleagues, found that the university students who spoke of their exploits of binge on Facebook tenían un riesgo significativamente more have with the drink that students who permanecieron silent on the issue.
Moreno sugiere que colleagues of the students, such as advisers residenciales, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who publique too many updates of State with his drinking.
« Can 't tratar un problema si no puedes diagnose », said Dimitri Christakis, the co - author of Moreno y director of the health center, behavior and development of the child in the Seattle Children' s Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
« We have found a way to identify children at risk que would otherwise not be diagnosed. ”
Facebook también is constantly « pinchando » its own population para obtener data.
The team of data of the site has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine 's Day, the expectation of turnout to half of the legislative period of 2010, and a índice of National Happiness (mainly utilizando information accessible - supporters of the digital freedom for a long time sostienen que the site should make available to other su large amount of data for research).
Sin embargo, users of Facebook saben que the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - slaughtering for poder playing Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the site tu mine personal information.
Pero ¿qué pasa when users of Facebook pasan to form part of a survey that do not even know?
While the researchers have well defined guidelines on how recoger sus data out of line, online is a sweeping free - for - all.
« Do not believe that many of the users have thought siquiera in the fact that an investigator podría be examining its perfiles », says Neil Selwyn, a sociólogo lab 's knowledge of London, on a study of 2006, which carried out with the walls of Facebook públicos students.
« As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends. ”
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research this siendo completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know que parte information of the profile of a usuario y of the messages of the wall are verdad.
« What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook son two completely different things, Selwyn » says.
That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles un y pen siguen siendo the best tools for research that no one can utilizar.
« No substitute for entering into the real world and speak with the real people ”, he says.
« Social research supone que se is on the social - and a lot of social todavía sucede out of line. ”
« Frío and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes its primera public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to ser the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 personas in Norway this summer, has described himself as a champion of the “ resistance ” during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
« I am a military commander in the resistance movement in norwegian and the Knights of Norway » Templarios, told an sala fills with 500 people.
« I object to the court, as recibió the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology of hatred and porque supports multiculturalism. ”
« Reconozco facts pero no I plead guilty. ”
The judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue, because it “ did not want to give Breivik, the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for que stating its views ».
Por the same token it refused to allow Breivik, which trajo un speech writing in advance, head to the relatives of their victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim también ordenó to the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks more, allowing him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should tener un strict control on all visitors and correspondence for eight semanas.
Around 30 supervivientes y relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some vinieron with the hope of looking to Breivik in the eyes, others para confirm that we found recluido low key.
Todos attended with the aim of making progress towards the conclusion.
I thought « parecía cold and inhumanity ”, said one superviviente of Utoya to ​​noruega broadcaster NRK.
« It uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seen and heard the suspect. ”
Vestido trunks oscuro y se blue tie, Breivik had calmed down and profesional throughout the hearing and looked to journalists and to the survivors in the eye when salió wandered in, the building.
Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik to be part of a movement of “ resistencia » higher, the judge ruled that it is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that it acted with accomplices.
It is possible that some are from que attacks on 22 July parezcan ser obra of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
Pero that automatically relaxes the pain and confusion that toda una nation still siente.
I would like to see « pareciera un monster, but it does not appear that », said the family of a victim.
« Sería much easier if the pareciera. ”
7 lessons of the interview perdida of Steve Jobs, they are in a theatre this week
Tras the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with the Henry Ford - distinguishing the genie of technology as the Great Inventor Moderno.
Pero what the fan of Apple podrían find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recientemente redescubierta that has been dusted in advance of a series of projections special in the biggest markets this week, it is understood how much this creative mind about the processes and trade flows of work of the products.
Was certainly a designer, soñador y hippie autorreconocido, but also was a thorough and organizador un yonki diagrams of the flow - a man who believed that many executives sufrían « una disease that is that una big idea is 90% of work … [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product. ”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series “ the Triumph of the Nerds (the triumph of idiots) on the eve of the computer, and personal sentó for more than an hour with Jobs and una extensive and rara conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been obligado out of Apple, and already trabajaba intensively in its new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a pequeña parte of the interview Cringely se utilizó in Nerds, said that the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs who se discovered an complete copy on VHS in the garage of a director.
This material archive, slightly reeditado, is the basis of Steve Jobs: the interview perdida, 68 minutes, which arrives in cinemas Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday.
Para someone known for odiar the in - depth interviews, Jobs sorprendentemente here, it seems willing to give their philosophies tecnológicas y business strategies.
Y very pensativo.
Four different throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of observations, where Jobs is considering clearly pensamientos, seeking precisión.
También there are moments in which too perfectionist of Jobs sale to the surface, where it appears anxious because of the questions of Cringely, empujándole to go faster toward issues o arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the ipod or the iphone, there is something oddly profético perdida in the interview, when Jobs assesses what it sees que otras companies make good and evil, and offers su propia visión the future of computing.
Una thing is to read póstumas assessments of the career of Jobs, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs who vemos here, the soñador eager to the brink of greatness.
Él tiene una visión of as you can y must be things.
Not long after, to explain everything in detail here, was, and it did.
Un rápido resumen seven secuencias notable: the interview perdida
Sobre learned how to wear a business:
« Over the years in the business, I always preguntaba: “ ¿por qué things you do? ” and the answers that te give way unchanged son: “ oh, that this is just the way it made ”.
No one knows por qué does what it does, in the business, no one thinks of things very deeply.
That is what I found.
Jobs leads to detail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple.
Bemused by the way is registraban costs - often starting with a “ standard ” cost que se did on rough estimates, and which was then covered with a “ variable » - developed a factory automated than claimed that podrían determine the costs of trade to detail.
Sobre the joke of the Pope:
Jobs tells the “ blue box ” que él same built with Steve Wozniak, a device that permitía people hackear effectively and telephone company making calls to long - distance away.
Se has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious.
Describes how él y Wozniak probaron box through the use of a phone público, making a so - called, and then conectándose from a red of AT &amp;amp; T to another, while establishing a loop with the largest number of satellites posible.
« We wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and gritabas through the phone público y volvía un - minute later on the telephone público - door side ”, says Jobs with a risita.
« Éramos young people and what we learnt was that podíamos build something ourselves that podría control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world. ”
Two, we did not know much, but podíamos build a small thing that podía control a giant thing - it was a lesson incredible, and I do not think that had ever been Apple sin.
Jobs still describing glorious él y que una joke Wozniak almost abandoned, knocking the Vatican through the blue box in the middle of the night and solicitando talk with the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As varios members of the catholic hierarchy were named in the middle of the night to speak with the american diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened para go to answer the phone.
Sobre fall in love with the technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, the hunting of spare parts to build a meter of frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett on the telephone directory y I made a call.
Poco after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs had a summer job in part - time work in Hewlett - Packard.
« That was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that he had seen that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well trataban their employees. ”
Se after Jobs turned in one of the employees of HP que visitaron research laboratories of the company in palo High, where it saw the first « ordenador table never done. ”
It was so big as a suitcase, had a pequeña pantalla catódico of pipe, and I enamoré of him.
Get a viaje until HP as an adolescent and perdería time with that machine and I would write programas para.
Sobre improvise innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new productos sobre the march.
Pronto in his career, which is set to be a salesman selling a puñado basis points, asked him un customer si podía todo mount the team.
Trabajando with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the assembly and the delivery of the devices finished.
Later, while I was in Apple, recalls the struggles faced by in the development of a mouse computer:
« I agree to take dramatic arguments … I shouted que se need five years [for creating a ratón que would cost $300], and I harté y I went outside and found a designer.
Noventa days later, we had a ratón que podíamos built for 15 and that was completely reliable.
Sobre large companies perdiendo force:
Long before that lead the renaissance of Apple, Jobs proféticamente previó the way in which many industry leaders tropezarían in his vision, and perderían control of their market share.
« Di que trabajas in IBM o Xerox, for what you do best fax machines and printers, and what? ”
You have the monopoly of the market share, which is why the company has no more successful.
The increase in sales and marketing success, so they are the kind of people that those returning from por running the business and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the forum for decision - making.
The genius of the products that led to this position of monopoly pudre por fault of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the job is necessary.
That is what has happened in Xerox …
Xerox podría have hijacked the entire computer industry.
Podría have been ten times its tamaño, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s …
Tomaron defeat of the victory.
Sobre innovation as artistic expression:
« There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product … as it develops the great idea, changing and growing. ”
Se learns a lot about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrificios que tienes que - do some things that you cannot make it to make the electrons, glass makes them, robots do, the factories make them.
Tienes que 5,000 keep things in your brain - these concepts - adjusted todos at once —
It all comes back to taste - rebaja exponerte to try to better than a team of human has done, but coming to adapt these things to which tu are doing.
Picasso said that the good artists copy, great artists roban.
We have had nunca vergüenza about stealing ideas.
That in part made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which incidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.
Si, were it not for the computer, I could be doing wonderful things in other areas.
Scalia y Thomas cenan with rivals in the law of health care while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court se reunió door closed to examine the issue politically controversial whether to accept the challenge to the health care law President Obama 's, two of the justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas y agasajados were at a dinner patrocinada por the signing of lawyers will present the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges reunieron in a preliminary hearing para study carefully the requests of review.
Uno cases in question was a complaint lodged by 26 states challenging the entire reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for the conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to take the demand and, in fact, we can expect a plea of historic 5 and a half hours to March, and the result will probably will further muddy the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the court 's decision was known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discontinued será probablemente Paul Clement 'as Attorney General of US during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that helped patrocinar annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been going on for many years devoted to the defence of the legal principles conservatives.
Otra signature patrocinó dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Otro patrocinador was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner se held in a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the Court on the case.
Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican most important in the Senate and un opositor declared the law of health care.
¿The special guests at the dinner? Scalia y Thomas.
Is nothing new: the two judges have been watching events in Federalist Society for years.
Y is not something that is in conflict with the ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
Si are, it could be said that fall under the code Canon 4C, which it says: “ a judge can attend events to recaudar funds of organisations relacionadas with the law and otras, although the judge cannot be a orador, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event. ”
Sin embargo, the proximity of absolute Scalia y Thomas to two of the lawyers in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government.
« This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the code is contrary to the demands of several judges who closely follows the court by the same rules that apply to all the judges se federal ”, said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (common cause).
The judges were « agasajados in a recaudación funds shown with lawyers tienen cases pending before the court. ”
Su appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event socava any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia y Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that mix too easily the tribunal 's work with the agenda driven by groups such as Federalist Society.
Y 's wife, Ginni Thomas, is a prominent conservative activist.
Por otra parte, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, that has a ético problema, not Scalia y Thomas.
Kagan trabajó as procuradora general of the Obama administration when they were first presented the first legal challenges to the law in the Court of First Instance.
Sus critics have been pushing to que se abstain Kagan of the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law and to now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he is going to do.
Boeing receives un pedido récord of $18 billion
The airline Emirates pide 50 double pasillo Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option to 20 more.
Boeing also vende seis planes Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, an operation valorada in more than $1 billion.
Rara vez is in the news when a firm should get a pedido 50 unidades of their product.
Pero is a great transacción when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of selling 50 aircraft amounts to a récord of $18 billion.
As big as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a gold mine in growth of future pedidos of aircraft.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years the airlines in the Middle East will require 2,520 aircraft valor 450 billion of dollars.
Boeing announced during the weekend su pedido largest in history to commercial aircraft su valor in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double pasillo.
The successful pedido vino airline Emirates in Dubái.
The airline también tiene una opción para buy 20 aircraft more, which would raise the price of total to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced in the living room Aeronáutico Dubái of 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said it had asked seis Oman Air Boeing 787 - 8s, the so - called “ Dreamliner ”, which presumes a saving fuel and unos servicios para pasajeros spectacular.
The price of selling seis of them is more than $1 billion.
« This is clearly a huge positive impact on Boeing ”, said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
« The quality of these customers in particular is very strong. ”
Many airlines in the Middle East are propiedad of its oil - producing nations.
Por, therefore, not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but that a rise in the price of fuel — usually perjudicial para airlines, because it is one of the largest costs - it is just as bad, because the country is making money for the increase in the price of oil.
This is important, because they have less likely than otras airlines cancel or retrasar orders flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora.
« Tienen una protección natural, ” he said.
The order of the Emirates solidifica 's leadership in the market for Boeing planes fuselaje width and helps to keep at bay the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade their dominance with passenger jet, the A350.
The victory of Boeing in the fair air to produce four months after Airbus said that it was delaying the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777 - 300ER.
The debut retrasó para add more momentum after customers demanded a growing burden útil y range.
The actions of Boeing Co subieron un 1.5% to $67,94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says that the drug helped to his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest para governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón parece have lost its bid to be governor of Michoacán during the election of the violent state, and she said on Monday that the drug helped tip the race in favour of one of his opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
« Intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process and, above all, is alarming yesterday, not only for Michoacán, but for the country ”, said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview un day after Sunday 's vote.
« Amenazaron our candidates, our workers election … se grabbed the ballot box, installed barricades … y ordenaron people votara » in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until perdió the presidency in 2000.
Sin embargo, is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI tiene hopes of winning the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo parece have surpassed por poco margin Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate 's conservative National Action of his brother, or conservationists, refused to acknowledge to Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left - leaning candidate por revolución Democratic Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, finished third, a major defeat for the divided left and unfortunate before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles también se refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied vínculos with drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels, specialised in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Felipe Calderón, and he chose Michoacán para - led military to launch an offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Sin embargo, the violence has persisted.
Un mayor of bread was murdered una semana before the elections while was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left the nominations local fear.
But for the PRI, unpalatable as they may appear the elections in Michoacán, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who supone representará to the PRI in presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo y said: “ I believe that this victory should be very encouraging for the next year. ”
The BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has appealed to India and China to preparen para helping to bail out the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis para avoid a recession in the long - term, which would prevent the growth of the asian economies.
Rajat Nag, the director general of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two biggest economies in the world 's fastest growing que tenían « do everything possible para accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc ya outside through the International Monetary Fund, or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China] países que observan the difficulties of Europe to a “ impartial ”, said the financial assistance in Asia, together with the leadership and recursos european help to avoid a long - term crisis in the global economy.
« We all in this together. ”
« So that anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful », told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
« Ser protegida Asia may to some extent, but cannot be immune. ”
« So if China and India can help, which is por todos means. ”
The monetary union, Europe has been severely undermined by una sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, borrowing costs in Italy have rocketed peligrosamente y the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that he might push the global economy into recession and has led to calls for major emerging economies que unan para help the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr Nag predijo que any support from Asia will go through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance, such as buying the bonds of the bail - out fund, the european financial stability fund - ofrecía un greater power to negotiate the asian countries of Europe.
Anand Sharma, indian trade minister, said that “ India is to do everything possible to help the eurozone para ya que su propia economy now was suffering the collapse of exports and the exhaustion of the inflow of foreign capital.
Nobody « quiere que eurozone siga siendo unstable and turbulenta », he said.
« We retos tenemos que monumental and maintain a high level of growth. ”
« Is not an option, is an imperative, for what we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women. ”
Otros argue that the developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help the rich european when faced in with their own profundos problemas economic.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be very hard sell políticamente aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live with around $2 a day or less.
« At some point will realise that the greek people retire at the age of 50 years and van on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well, ” he said.
Lee Howell, the managing director of the World Economic Forum, is also preguntó por qué reserves of India is to be used for keeping the numerous and well - paid trabajadores greek public sector, in jobs of companies poorly managed, and loss as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threat with “ significant impact on chain ” por toda Asia.
The prognosis of the Asian Development Bank 's 7.5% of economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 is now facing the “ risks to the bottom ” due to the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “ planes of contingency ” para protegerse of a crisis and significativas salidas capital of their economies.
Serios Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defence
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the cuts automatic budget ahead podrían socavar national security and provocar una reacción financial chain from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the chains of assembly civilians.
The Pentagon is ya digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now teme una reducción additional 600 billion or more in cuts que si puede ser imminent Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.
« The impact of these cuts sería devastating for the department ”, Panetta said in a letter to the senators John McCain, a Republican por Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican por South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its result, the so - called “ secuestro », would lead to a 23% of reductions and global un high in many projects nuevos.
« Un recorte large tan, applied this indiscriminately, make the most of our projects naval and construction could not be carried out - you cannot buy tres quarters of a ship or an building - and seriously harm otros efforts of modernisation ”, Panetta wrote to the senators.
También « we would be forced to remove many of our civil servants of intentional and, due to the reduction would impose so quickly, it is almost certain that tendríamos que licenciar civilians in order to meet the objective. ”
These changes « romperían faith with those who continue our army and seriamente would damage the readiness. ”
The cuts in time to reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
« Si well funding for tiempos of war in the accounts of contingency operations overseas is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war verían adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of base ”, warned Panetta.
« Procurement personnel reduciría, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war. ”
« Staff in payroll se reduciría, leading to delays in payments to providers in time of war, and the support is legally and politically interrupted. ”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
« The result to a kidnap in the Department of Defense provocaría un rápido decline of the United States as the main potencia military in the world. ”
« We are strongly against this draconian action », the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening when publicaron the Charter of Panetta.
« This is not a result with which it is possible to live, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves. ”
« The abduction is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and must not be allowed to ocurra. ”
Si the Charter of Panetta y recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget compromise, un o stepped up calls for exempting the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about the potential cuts, despite the fact that came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in the budgets in Congress and the White House sabiendo y que se faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, Secretary of Defense pintó un sombrío panorama of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a núcleo.
« Is a ship without sailors. ”
« Brigade is a sin bullets. ”
« Is an air wing sin suficientes pilotos trained. ”
« Is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without suficientes soldados suited to the mission ”, said Panetta in their words opening in the Pentagon.
« Is a force that sufre low morale, the preparation and is not able to keep up to date with potential adversaries. ”
In fact, « invites aggression » …
In an appendix to their letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta nuevos set out details of how the reductions « generate significant risks operativos: the time delay in response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; limited severamente nuestra capacity to be made and committed previamente around the world; and supone un riesgo unacceptable in future operaciones fighter. ”
Y Panetta said that some of the biggest projects of upheld could face the axe, including anyone already are trying some y solo in the early stages of planning.
The list includes the fighter plane F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber previsto, the submarine ballistic new generation, the new ship combat coastline and the new vehículo fighter on land the Army and Navy, in need of reemplazar humvee.
Stop the development and the additional evidence of the F35 podría generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his partidarios say that it is the next step vital para improve and dealing with the potential threats from China and other rivales.
As a lie
Un vistazo to the most recent headlines shows us how serios y omnipresentes son deception and lie in everyday life.
The republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is occupied by exchanging accusations of sexual harassment, with several women; each side accused of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury por supuestamente ocultar reports that said that un football coach retirado sexualmente was damaging to children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, was “ pillado » with an open microphone claiming the President of the United States, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed países.
Congressman por nueva exhibicionista York and on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with their denials rápidamente rebatidos por the irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of offences in the financing of the campaign relacionadas with the smell of a relationship - marital.
Y, again, that is what no viviera olvidará never the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton for lying during his mandate segundo about sexual of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Are widespread legends sobre cheating on tests of school and university.
Se have given cases in which teachers have given the responses of exams for students in order to be better vistos in their assessments of performance.
Mentores que should be taught to the contrary are sending the message that lie and cheat son acceptable.
¿Deception, how much are we?
On an ordinary day, studies show that te pueden lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That is for sure, many of these lies are white lies.
Otro study showed that the unknown mentían tres veces in the first 10 minutes of getting to know.
Detecting lies, or “ the location of lies' skill, is an essential that we must acquire all, for reasons tanto personales as professionals.
Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is crying out: “ you tengo », the detection of deception be lost knowledge seria based on scientific data obtenidos during the last six decades in prestigious universidades que realizaron proyectos of in - depth investigation, especially posts in psychology and physiology.
Uno of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies have been rebatidos.
The liars sí look in the eye.
Not always tartamudean, stuttering out, ruborizan o feel uneasy.
It cannot be concluded tampoco que liars sean difficult to detect or expose.
Un detector lies trained puede come to learn the truth about the structure of the statement, the expressions microfaciales, training of questions and the times.
Pasé varios years sondeando discoveries scientists on the deception in the vast y siempre emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a technique which is easy to learn and to help navigate nuestro complex world - especially if sus responsabilidades profesionales include recruitment, interviews, and the management of negotiations.
The good liars tienen the ability to read well to the other, making them sentir at ease, handling sus propias emotions and sintiendo intuitively how others perceive them.
Sabemos por investigations that the extrovertidos lie more introverted, men say more “ lies orientadas to itself ”, while women say more lies « orientadas towards the rest ” — normal way for proteger feelings of someone — que married people lie less frequently to their partners que people who are not married (but the lies that suelen say tienden to be “ enormous).
También sabemos que si usted is seen as a perpetrator, the others were sentirán less guilty the deception.
¿How saber si someone is lying?
Primero, it appeared the usual conduct charge.
It 's called “ creating a line of base ”.
Help to provide puntos benchmarks to measure after the changes.
Observe the position of the person, risa y feature vocal.
It is best I can usually golpetea si someone with the foot todo the time for not making accusations unfair when will see the foot golpeteando in half of the meeting.
Next, look for groups of deceptive behavior, verbales y non - verbal.
Consider these groups of behaviour as hard alarm, not as evidence of deception.
The people who cheat pueden freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember su history, can point sus pies for the door, lean towards a salida, change its stance significantly o display a « comfort postentrevista » — that exaggerated suspiro of relief, and change of position que una vez todas difficult questions have been completed.
Often the interrogators makes out falsely que solo para has ended the interview that seek relief postentrevista.
También presta attention to the vocabulary of the person.
Scott Peterson got its foot until the fund and usó said that while the past tense su wife murdered was viva, launching a search of it on a national level.
The people who cheat también pueden usar un distanciador language: “ I had no relaciones sexuales with this woman … Miss Lewinsky » o repetir una pregunta íntegramente difficult.
The indicators verbales more common sutiles.
Can someone usar un pile of “ language restrictivo » when replied to a question difficult: “ Well … to tell the truth … so what I se … in my opinion. ”
This means that the answer is una percepción instead of a fact, and it is often a señal warning.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but develop skills to discover the deception is possible.
These skills, improve the chances of any for avoiding being victimizados por artists of the scam in their careers and personal lives.

The pipeline, 700 kilometres is stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.

Para it, we would need to cross seis states.
It is odiado por environmentalists, but most loved by the working groups, which have opted for the estimate of 20 000 jobs linked from the oil pipeline.

The other is whether a firm that was contracted to conduct the study was an original choice inappropriate as it was linked to TransCanada.

Se form on Wednesday the new italian government
The nominated as first minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of presentar Italy to the new government that will be facing a crisis that has pushed the country to the brink of economic disaster
The nominated as first minister of Italy, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of presentar Italy to the new government that will be facing a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has put at risk the whole eurozone.
Un release of the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that puede form a government.
Se expected to present un cabinet is largely made up of tecnócratas, although it is not clear when the office will assume the new executive.
Monti said that the President presentará the outcome of their talks with political parties in their attempt to form a government.
« Quiero confirm my absolute confidence in our country 's ability to overcome this difficult phase ”, said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that podrá form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the hurdles are have superados.
“ The framework is now featured », he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fighter una financial and political crisis has pushed the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new government led by former European Commissioner Mario Monti must adopt a hard paquete of austerity demanded by european leaders to recuperar the battered confidence in Italy.
Subrayando pressure on Monti to se hurry up, the instability of the markets put the performance of italian bonds BTP to 10 years for above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland will be vieron obligadas to be rescatadas.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, Italy 's employers told the press tras reunirse with Monti: “ Dijimos que would support a lot to this government. ”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy exiting from this emergency.
The chances of success of Monti vieron driven considerably as the backing of Silvio Berlusconi 's PDL party, whom the crisis obligó to resign on Saturday.
« Creemos que efforts of Professor Monti are intended to have a positive result », told the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the party 's right - of - centre.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had fought the government majority tecnócrata que is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support para apply what will probably serán reformas unpopular austerity.
Any blocking or retraso in their efforts podría provocar un nuevo y devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks sumó to pressure the note that one failure of Monti sería un disaster.
Monti began Monday sus consultations with the political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with organisations, youth and women.
Pondrá end to their ronda meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday Napolitano, who has available transición extremely rapidly in response to the crisis.
Tras un brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi will resign, the costs of the italian debt now have returned to critical levels between the uncertainty over whether the new Prime Minister will hold éxito.
Rescatar to Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite the predictions of widespread sobre que politicians sólo will tiempo to implement the reforms before early elections.
Monti has said he would like to include políticos in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that must be consisting solely por técnicos, a sign of their reparos facing a process obligados por financial pressure.
Sources políticas señalaron que the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.

Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is hardly nuestra segunda vez in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I have been in Costa Rica solo y una vez holiday; it is a country tan beautiful and I think that we are going to be able to quedarnos unos days there.
So we moved that make our music there.
Se because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fan viven intensity in the preceding days.
¿What you say to its most ardent fans?
Thank you for permanecer on our side through all these years.
It took almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there.
Some people even been refiere to its largest concert as a show of the year.
¿Adds that a poco pressure your visit?
Some tv larger than we have touched on for the last 21 years sucedieron over the last couple of weeks.
Tocamos un par of shows huge in Sao Paulo y we hope that we have put into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
In truth, we are very anxious to come there.
We love this country, we love surfear y jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
¿How discovered was that Costa Rica and sus olas para surfear?
Tenemos many friends who are surfeadores y tengo un great friend that vive in Tamarindo y waves that son incredible.
My friends were going to siempre se surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surfear; it was how we learn, by means of people who love surfing.
To see the tour, have been handing out shows huge with many songs.
¿What have planned para su presentación in Costa Rica?
We have touched on there as never before, we do not have any restrictions sobre what we can do.
We will try to make the best show posible with a good variedad song; trataremos touched on a par with songs of each álbum y give our fan un good and diverse repertorio.
You never repiten the repertoire.
¿Why should this be?
I think that is partially porque tenemos nueve disks and podemos tocar more than 120 songs and every one I like different songs, so it is difficult to choose what songs tocar each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire they have rato not touch, that keeps us focused and también keeps us sorprendidos porque reminds us of the reasons why we like these songs and que se pudo we have forgotten.
This means that show sea more interesting for us and, therefore, I also believe him more interesting for the people.
With this tour, are holding 20 years.
Looking back, it is difficult to believe everything that has been achieved?
Sí, absolutely.
First of all, I think that none of us can imagine that we would be in a large rock band y have done for more than 20 years, makes it seem like as a dream.
Seguimos nuestras counting blessings y we moved that much we can seguir making music together.
Todos we want y we love to create music.
Somos lucky to go to places in the world who are always quisimos go.
Things could not be better for us.
¿What significó para ustedes the fundamental have been part of the emergence of the grunge?
Siempre it has been an honour to be parte in this group of big bands.
Somos very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney y Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement surge of a group of friends and is a rarity.
Once in a while, a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten salen bands at the same time of the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the group of Seattle.
Todavía tocamos with some of them once in a while.
Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains y were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw to Soundgarden in his tour, so we are lucky to be friends of all they still y graced us ser parte this sonido in Seattle which surgió.
También is very strange that a band as the of you keep unida y with the same Member tanto tiempo.
Sí, four of us have we are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) brought us together 13 years ago, which, in itself, is much more time than last many gangs.
First of all, I think we are all fortunate to still be alive, and secondly, all we care about the others.
Todos somos friends very close and, thanks to this, have also been open avenues musical que give him freedom to each of experiment.
We trust each other with the music of each, and could not be better.
The relationship you with the word fame was no easy task; however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want.
¿Can find a balance sheet?
“ As we have been growing, has been more easy to find a balance sheet.
We make sure we cannot be too tour porque is easy to fall into the hands of the large crowds of people who loves y tu music.
As long as one recuerde que people is there for the music, that te recuerde que Thou respetar music and what the trajo, without encapricharse por un ser ser famous and rock star, something that none of it we are interested in.
¿How recuerda su otro proyecto Mother Love Bone?
I think that we wrote a very good songs and was initially something grand.
We were one band por almost three years and I never publicamos un disk until after he died Andy (Andrew Bretton).
There were many frustrations porque last tanto y what is most important is that we still somos very friends Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the band with us and when I hear una song o veo una pienso photo in the incredible persona que Andy was and how I was reír, provided it was a joy to go to work, reírnos, talk about music and football y much more.
He was human sorprendente y as shocked.
The band national Robertas será responsible for open show in Costa Rica.
¿It is true that you know their trabajo, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why the para chose the opening?
Sí, production sent us videos several proposals y that was the group who we liked more, so we are eager to see what the Robertas puede ofrecer live y should be very entertaining.
¿Por qué siempre change the letter of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
The él sings y I believe it does so with the first thing that happens.
¿As bearish, what their influences?
Son tantas.
Within the first I have are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski …
Son tantos que toda podría talk afternoon on the falling que I adore.
¿How has managed to maintain the Pearl Jam relevante grunge despite no longer be una fashion?
I think that all of us always we were all a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana y todas which surgieron at the same time, and, if there are relevancia now, I think that is something wonderful because it is music they vale worth listening to and gangs as Mudhoney are now doing better music they nunca.
At the outset, music tenía un content darkest and has now become more positive.
¿What has caused this change?
It is interesting because I believe that there are a couple of songs on the new álbum que tal vez parezcan lighter, but there are also songs, as the end o Just Breathe que qualify as songs very dark although sonar un poco positivas.
With both, when Ed tocó, I cried when I heard and son songs profundamente oscuras.
I think that when there is any more y trauma in your lives and se pierde to a relative or friend un, these things are starting to influence tu tu art and music, and these two songs, without a doubt, is that for me.
También, I think it can be ser una persona happy and still be able to music they sea oscura.

We ended the operation, it changed the lock on the door to avoid a repeat of the situation.

¿Parque o mountain?
The architects coincide in the opportunity of the call beyond polemics sobre fees
The contest municipal sobre 16 puertas reabre the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediados of 80, at the height of the now defunct Corporation metropolitan Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed unos pasquines promotion Collserola.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the great parque of the Barcelona Metropolitan.
What is more, they attached a comparison figures, with the Central Park New Yorker.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park volvió to be placed in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that are not geared to the north - south axis sino - down mountain (above) (Sea).
The rating of Collserola as parque natural redunda on this idea.
The reference ya Central Park was not sino Yellowstone, with jabalís in the role of the bear Yogi.
In these was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 competitions for otras tantas puertas access to Collserola.
Una puerta remite to the idea for the theme park, without a doubt.
O that or someone pretende poner puertas to the countryside.
The question sale sola: Collserola, parque o mountain?
The competition, both for its vertiente merely organizativa and what it means for reflection on the city is the topic of conversation between all the architects people of Barcelona.
It is now almost un tema recurrente to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of elected se reconocen in a lift.
Y this leads, quite rightly, to one of the few similarities between what tres architects people of Barcelona, and profesores universitarios, that it has been.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol y Marta Bayonne: the contest is timely.
Para Roldán, having dealt with the coastline « se is necessary ” to discuss « the mountain ”, while the speech Ildefons Cerdà, apples verdes, has not been carried out.
« Partir is on the basis that the park more extensive Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things by their great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex », according to the architect para quien the title of “ puertas of Collserola » contains a « trampa léxica »: we must not think of “ as the entrance to a theme park, but the demarcation of zonas where we need to act. ”
Mòdol, as Roldán y Bayonne with experience in the world urbanístico, called the proposal “ reto intellectual » with “ certain risk ».
Peligros derived from “ uncertain that is today proyectar public space » tras experience in the 1980s, and que tuvo in the area of the Fòrum « su swan ».
The first temor is the very definition of borders where they can build.
« Limit something is already setting the next step, which is to say, its » sobrepaso.
« We need to think of new instruments urbanísticos, planning, because the current [in reference to the plan General Metropolitan (PGM)] pueden lead to real disasters ».
Leaner to the question, Mòdol opina que, simplifying, the alaskan vallesana of Collserola « puede understood, the park as a Barcelona, no ”, a point merely topográfica.
Mòdol recuerda que ya there is a trabajo made by Patronat of Collserola que « must not fall on deaf ears », while grateful for the opportunity that the City ofrece his body to intervene in this project « from the first moment. ”
Y even more, he understands that the closeness of the mountain in the city is the salvoconducto que permite architects to enter the debate, but “ doubt ” sobre si is this profile técnico must lead the disciplinary teams (“ everything right, un » points) have had to create: “ the architects should be solo una tool ”.
Bayonne insinuated that the answer to the question that gives título to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the contest is a lack of global visión Collserola: “ you have called 16 contests transversales - says - mountain - sea, but there is no reading longitudinal, look at y understands the area as a whole. ”
This causes, at least in its case, which has opted for participar in 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for una doors puede clash in programa y definition of the architect of the door.
In his opinion, the city should ensure that the lower the Round Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that making a suave transición between the city and the verde.

He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify mexican risk factors for prevenir the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
The held this November 14 World of diabetes, specified que the aim is to raise to three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervisión of their parents, for the application of questionnaires specific food.
También se asking sobre physical activity and background heredofamiliares diseases, with the aim of preventing risk factors that triggered padecimientos as diabetes or kidney failure.
Detailed que se Saturdays applies to all participants measurements antropométricas (peso, talla, waist circumference of), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, cholesterol levels, triglycerides and insulin y genetic (seeks to identify gene associated with child obesity).
Cruz Lopez señaló que obedece this research to the concern of the professional health by the alarming increase in weight in the minors.
« Surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 señalaron que in just six years, there was an increase in the case of children, from 77 percent in obesidad, and girls of 47%; overweight también se observó un dramatic rise », underlined the specialist in IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the search of the markers se sustenta in which the country 's population differs from other por su genetic history.
Reported that on average, the Mexican tiene 65% of american indian heritage, 30% and 5% Africa and this condition is refleja in gene associated with diabetes, and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is the inability to traduce burning the excess of energy we use (calories) and stored in the form of fat.
The researchers explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which enables it to detect if presentan some overweight u obesidad.
Even, he said, the presence of pliegues color obscuro (acantosis) in neck and antebrazo, which indicate the likelihood that padezca metabolic disorders y until prediabetes.
The information will be handled on a confidential basis, the doctors give por writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and changes in the way of life that should make to prevenir diseases.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components que cause sobrepeso, obesity and chronic otros padecimientos: sedentary, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain the most part of the day sitting in front of the television or utilizar means of transport instead of walking short distances.
También se due to the high calorie intake, that is to say, the greater consumption of drinks azucaradas, carbohidratos (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, and so on) with high in fats and proteínas y the genetics being considered in this protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, a senior researcher at the chemistry of the UNAM, develops asfaltos modified with polímeros para producir una mixed with better performance, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
Si the signals that sends the pavement were met, it would not require repairing potholes about $200 each season of rain in the area Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Nájera Herrera, a senior researcher at the power of chemistry (FQ) UNAM si, who ensured that the process of building and maintaining a pavimento asfáltico is the right one, the cracks podrían reducirse in quantity or, indeed, be completely removed.
In its Conference an opinión tecnológica of potholes, handed down in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, made it known that the laboratory to his office develops asfaltos modified with polímeros para producir una mixed with semejantes characteristics to the tarmac, but with a greater resistance mechanics, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of asfaltos modified podrían utilizarse in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the training of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, the main bulk of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, high - molecular peso, called asfaltenos, and other low - weight, so - called molecular maltenos that together they give to pavimento su characteristic viscoelástico behaviour.
The behaviour of the viscoelástico asphalt is that at high temperatures, close to the 180 degrees, acts as a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade su viscosidad is extremely high, and to 50 degrees centigrade presenta un state almost sólido, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt se vuelve quebradizo, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but rather we are going changing during the day, according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in engineering química.
The investigator 's FQ observó que the streets of Mexico City in its majority are covered by pavimento flexible, which is made up of six layers of materials, including the last three involving the asphalt.
Among the more superficial se the file tar, shaped by pequeñas piedras bathed in asphalt and then compactadas.
Each of the piedritas que is the file, pointed out, is stained with asphalt.
The transitar vehicles and generated efforts, this permite que forces spread very well on the pavement.
Si se tratara asphalt amended se difundirían even better, felt the engineer químico.
The file sobre tar, he is a veritable última layer called file rolling, which is made of a material of stone fine, which is to say, a sand that también se washes in asphalt.
As this is the layer that va to be in contact with the tyres of vehicles, must have more mechanical than the file tar y proporcionar friction in the way.
As part of the pavimento que va to receive and disseminate the efforts, the file rolling requiere also have the thickness and appropriate se must take care of the material is made.
The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, in particular the water, he said, because it affects considerably to the performance of the file tar.
When the field was humedece, water in the interior of the file and it is difficult for salga, it causes un reblandecimiento of all sections of the pavimento y, therefore, the training of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, is the first to wear the film of rodamiento y sólo then it affects the file tar, but the damage is not instantly, but that is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with appropriate programas of maintenance.
Who is also a member of the system 's National researchers explained that the vehicular burden is another important factor in the training of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of pavimento must always be in connection with the vehicular burden y to ensure that it complied with, to avoid potholes are often.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and trabajar sobre the asphalt, for example, emulsiones tar, which in other countries ya se are even in the market and permiten reparar the cracks easily and at no need to use high temperatures.
¿What he came to the candidate of the Valle para ser the new señorita Colombia?
Analysis of the factors which incidieron para que Melina Ramírez Serna did not achieve the crown of señorita Colombia.
The Valle recibe su título número 14 princesa.
The Valley Cauca se queda with the appetite for the crown of señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna tuvo que se shape with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the group who the show as a new princesa of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the reins, the department ya suma 14 títulos of princesa Melina un y se the legion of women vallecaucanas que have been close to the crown pero que were proclamas princesas including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Elizabeth Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question is how many are doing what was lacking?
Porque the outcome represents the defeat of a great favourite que in each presentación showed that she had todo para ser the new señorita Colombia, not in vain was elected as Queen of the Police y Better Face Jolie of Vogue, que obtuvieron reinas as Taliana Natalia Vargas o Navarro quien se led the crown of señorita Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key to the decision taken by the jury to appoint its members primera princesa radica in which not impressed with its response to the question “ what is this book that te has marked by y por qué? made by Martín Gómez Murillo, the cart literary Leamos.
The interrrogante the vallecaucana respondió:
« Leo, I find it quite a lot in the literature, I believe it is a form of culturalizarse definitely, I believe that the book that I marked childhood is “ the principito », the book is quite serious.
Currently I read “ crime and punishment ”, is a book of world literature que todos must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, one Russian, a book called “ beautiful que se the heat of ». ”
Una respuesta poco primero por que liked the term “ culturalizarse » y segundo por not to explain in a particular how each of the books that have cited the set.
Pero at the end of the ceremony, said Melina sentirse tranquila y happy with the result « the universe is wise pasa what pasar.
Para toda y people, please read un poquito, “ the principito » is a great book ”
Among the scenarios launched se says that the Valle quemó favouritism.
Un periodista bogotano hinted that the preferred, the ovacionada y the woman candidate who came wearing a todos prizes preliminares (reto of gastronomy Oster, vote from the public about the best traje artisanal, and Queen Mother), “ that was the jealousy of the other candidates, estresó Queen y por that shone in the scenario ”.
This is y notó in her first speech in bathing in the beach 's Hilton y sus two parades in the evening of coronation.
But in both lució segura, notó que lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena y Atlantic sí showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the “ at home ”, as the channel RCN opinó que the fact that Melina appointed princesa « notes that the candidate, more premios wins during the contest is not as reina ».
In addition, Valle se showed the last very elusive, with the press, and that is where we are wrong.
Otra hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury sobre su interest in social work, which is in últimas, the essence of the National beauty contest.
Por something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who is committed to social needs of its pais.
« Beauty sola is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and social focus in your sensitivity, which before entering the contest are involved in projects », explained.
También se speculation that Valle pecó por sus flaws in the derriere fibrosis y que se I noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory pues precisamente the jury chose as the candidate « beauty natural ” with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical trabajo responsable.
The preparador of Hernán reinas Jorge Orozco reconoce que Melina was not the best body, which had better, “ but su problema of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for my was not highly visible, I fell puntos on the last day. ”
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the surgeries que se practicó.
« The surgeries are fine, but it is not the Valle supo do.
Su body nunca was his strong and here is the claimed ».
Por this prize, which for the first time released the contest 's National Bold, after the parade in bathing surgió cruel vaticinio que un last night he performed, he said that this was the contentillo que Raymundo denied to Melina para not to give them a taste of the krona.
Realidad o not, the fact is that from today Melina begins year reign, not as soberana, but as princesa, a position that it offers the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the competitions in international 's own National nomination contest.
Sin embargo, she pasará in history as one of the reinas que despite its overwhelming paso por Cartagena, he was elusive crown.
Such was the work of the caleño que identified the dead body of Alfonso Cano
Un lofoscopista of Cali pasó in history as the man who confirmed the death of “ Alfonso Cano ».
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November, a lofoscopista CTI 's Cali pasó in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum: “ the Farc leader Alfonso Cano », through the comparison of their fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopistas que working in the seccional of CTI, this week was coming up the “ availability » to Eliazar González, a man of Puerto tejada que leads 21 years working in the area of judicial inquiry.
To start his career, González trabajó in municipalities in Chocó, where many times tuvo que stops on more than five days in the jungle para come to the site in which the bodies were to be identified.
In the 2000 trasladó to the capital of the Valle and then to carry out the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin of friction, namely, palms of of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him that carried ropa tres minimum for days.
Something big is expected.
On Friday night the Cauca salió para in a helicopter from Palmira.
Sabía que had to identify two bodies and que se sospechaba que uno of them was the man who ran the guerrillas world 's oldest, for which he was asked to carry the card decadactilar of Guillermo León Sáenz verdadero (his name).
Sin embargo, when it came to the research team to the site in which it found the corpse not recognised por su physical aspect, since it was very different to that had seen in the media.
There were, beard, dressed like a farmer in the area, without glasses and a lot thinner.
Pero fingerprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, tinta, a transplantador y una glimmering lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the card.
Su ojo not ruled: “ Alfonso Cano ».
That same night, the man oriundo Puerto tejada was confirm to the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzon, se trataba the maximum, head of the Farc.
In search of the footprint
Para un dactiloscopista of Sijín of Cali recognition that did the President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference por operational against “ Cano », it is very significant.
Not many people are aware of our work.
The dactiloscopia is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support inquiries by y theft crimes such as murder and confirm the identity of the people caught.
When they are caught, many criminals are bonds false or have no papers.
We will take the fingerprinting y the seek in the database.
The investigator told us that, in a case of theft, it was quitar un pedazo wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported his power to take strong una box full of jewellery and money.
« The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate for superficies sacar una fingerprinting, but in that case pudimos obtener the footprint of the entire and identify the offender, who had participated in various » petty theft, recalled.
Fingerprints también pueden dismiss o reafirmar sospechosos in cases of murder.
Recently found a man dead, with bottles of liquor around her.
Por half of the research found that un family podría ser sospechoso of crime and, effectively, a footprint in the bottle clashed.
While this does not guarantee that has been the killer, they ubica at the scene of the crime.
Un dactiloscopista of CTI explained that in the objects « fingerprints would be sacan with reactivos químicos o physical ».
When they occur, they use transplantador un o tape in order to lift it.
After that, the perceptions are sent to the Asif, which is the basis of delinquency data, or the Registraduría.
« The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented ”, said the expert of CTI.
Clarified that not everything is as shown in the television programme, CSI.
As well as not everything that is gold shines, not everything that is toca se vuelve footprint.
Sin embargo, if it can be usada if it is collating respectivo.
The “ indignant » defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protestors agolpaban Zuccotti para camp out in the square.
Una much in the cost and se trasladó paruqe to a close.
The members of the movement ocupa Wall Street challenged this Tuesday to the authorities in New York by trying to enter again, under the aegis of a court order, the square in Manhattan since they were ousted night dealing and trying to occupy otro parque of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of protestors agolpaban before Zuccotti Square, where they wanted me to thank access on a warrant judicial permite “ outraged » volver to camp out in the place, whereas another part of the movement respondió displacement ocupando un parque further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
« Our idea is that, if the court does not we turn to camp out in the square, we are going to fit in some other place, and we will continue to battle the legal by volver to Zuccotti, as well as through - long sit - y peaceful demonstrations », one of the leaders of the movement “ Ocupa Wall Street ”, Mark Bray.
Bray que detailed the response of the “ indignant » displacement of their camp personalmente por dictated the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came up to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibía forced the evacuation of the place and permitía on demonstrators to stay camped out.
In addition, the “ indignant » procedieron to the occupation of a new parque situado at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to Holland, which unites nueva York and nueva Jersey, and propiedad parish of Trinity Church.
At least for one hour ocupar managed to the place, but then the Police will procedió to stop some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while told Efe que vio a number of journalists were also que handcuffed.
The organization says that son varios hundreds of people they had installed at that point, where they have already moved una delegation of religious leaders in a show of support for the movement, and that has tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a recinto private property - is still closed pending the conclusion of a vista judicial prevista para this Tuesday in which they must review the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some of the demonstrators posted there portaban y repartían at this hour copies of this judicial and even indulged in officers guarding the square, which has led to some small « clashes', indicated Bray, who deplored the fact that some officers propinaron blows to the demonstrators.
The court order prohibe authorities to evict the members of Ocupa Wall Street or apply “ laws publicaron after the occupation began o prohibir demonstrators them re - enter the park with tiendas u otras propiedades que utilizaban previously ”.
Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to the court, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, who warned, however, that the local laws do not allow them to volverse to install with tiendas of campaign and sacos of sleep.
The regidor personalmente defended the eviction carried out dawn Zuccotti Square, an operation in which procedió around 200 arrests and that se porque decided the demonstrators were “ violando law. ”
Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the square porque ésta se « it was turning into a place where people were not to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do damage to other people », as “ some business habÍan recibido threats ” y neighbors temían « por su quality of life ”.
The eviction « early this morning was disgusting y shows that in the fund Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests that workers Americans ”, added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of “ lack of respect for freedom of speech. ”

Japan renace tras the earthquake
The GDP growing by 1.5%, thanks to household consumption, and pone end to the spiral of declines began in March
Since last March, Japan 's economy was still convalescing por paralizada, the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that padeció nipón the country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo 1.11 material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, it seems to have watered down.
After consecutive than three quarters of declines, the fact of the gross domestic product between July and September sirvió para pasar página, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared with the previous and trimestre un 6% in tasa annualized.
In the second quarter — to the Japanese, the fiscal year starting in March 2012 - is, moreover, the faster pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
Recovery will be explained, in part, by the upsurge in the purchase of machinery to restaurar areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investment in a 1.1%, compared to a drop of 0.9% on the cost of capital observó from January to March, the first retroceso after six months of rises without interruption.
Sin embargo, the real revulsivo of the japanese economy is not based solely on the momentum keynesian, invited to take advantage of the crisis to reforzar - or - reconstruir infrastructure, servirse shortcomings para grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently make up 60% of Japan 's GDP.
This peaked un 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo have been has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen, Japan 's currency — has become one of the “ values refugio » chosen by investors fleeing from the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky previsiones US, a privilege that pesa, like a bombshell in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, resultan products more expensive overseas, a serious revés para un país whose line of floating economic viene determined by the health of the large groups tecnológicos.
Toyota o Sony, for example, blaming weak sus resultados between July and September to the value of the yen.
While the markets remain with their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not leave the guard.
« We should be alert to the risks that persisten, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen », pointed out yesterday, the state secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
Y, in effect, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) precisó que most countries member countries submitted in September signos more distinct of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the points of turning into the world economy puso highlights that the major powers se are slowing down.
Ya que fell four tenths to 100,4 puntos, compared with 100,8 August.
The euro zone, even were por below the average, which is at the level of 100, in rushing ocho tenths to 99,13 puntos.
Athens vuelve to feed the doubts
Papadimos says that it will approve the adjustments, but the Conservatives not to sign a written commitment
With the risk premiums periféricas shot y uncertainty reinstalada in parqués, Greece is still stumbling into the maze that led to the departure of the great european debt crisis.
The feeling that the “ consensus ” of the new transitional government Hellenic viene more imposed by the demands of Brussels por un genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days agreed in its designation quizás se quede short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative Party nueva democracy, Antonis Samaras, claimed that will not support nuevas austerity measures in any case and reiteró su call new elections to the scheduled date, on February 19.
« The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October » aseveró Papadimos, by opening up yesterday, a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive.
Un paquete with 24 programas para boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and nuevas measures against tax evasion serán the first initiatives.
Sin embargo, the message of Samaras does not deal with the doubts about its postura: “ we are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to any more. ”
The conservative leader was a pasito further in their struggle to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unblock the 8 million that Athens needs to urgently and made it clear that it will have set its seal on any letter of commitment to compliance with the adjustments.
The European Commission, pero escocida alone by the impact felt the por órdago of the referendum Papandreou confirmed yesterday that su demand is strong: not will release aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties helenos not signing « un commitment written with ambiguity and as soon as possible. ”
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors regresarán « very soon » to Athens to discuss with the new Government: “ it needs to service the sixth tramo » of 8 billion, although there are definitive date.
The bundle greek still has thread para rato.
Lady Sofia: “ they are instruments for progress and hope ”
The Queen highlights the place « preponderante » of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain “ has reached a prominent place at global level in the role of the Microfinanzas ».
The Queen Sofia Mrs recordó yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades in the second donor in the world in relation to this a tool of cooperation, whose “ essence ” señaló que radica « on being a tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in being human ”.
The Queen opened yesterday, the 5th World Summit of the Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that “ there is no doubt ” that is tipo operations son « absolutely indispensable ones ” para achieve the Millennium Development Goals set up by the UN, with horizon 2015, and, “ especially, in that tiene goal as the halving of the volume of people living with an income of less than one dollar a day, with which contains the “ poverty threshold ”.
Spain “ sigue trabajando » para extend the network of beneficiaries « to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task “ with responsibility », said Mrs Sofia, which expectation that the initiatives and contributions that are originen at the summit, which runs until Thursday, “ to ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women ”, the main beneficiaries of these loans.
Son « many achievements » y « many challenges that we face ».
The summit of the Microcredit se plantea not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to boost « two goals basic ”.
Thus, his Majesty explained that he aspires to the end of 2015 sean 175 millions of poor families que agreed to these services and financial que 100 million of those homes salgan the poverty line in which hangs.
The momentum in the design of the micro - credit in Spain and in the rest of the world « has followed the path started years ago so pionera » por Muhammad Yunus emphasise Mrs Sofia as an “ act of justice and reconocimiento due.
It described the father of this tool as a “ idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty, ” whose work known for 15 years ago, when the Queen viajó to Bangladesh to know about the ground su política of loans.
To this experience was followed by un year later the first World Summit in Washington and their meetings as the celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada, 2006, and “ in all have been able to see the continued development ”, explained the Majesty, whose vínculo with this project earned him yesterday described as the “ head of family ” congregada in Valladolid por parte “ baquero of the poor ”.
Finally, the Queen Sofia Mrs concluded its intervention by encouraging people to take part in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty.
« Imperativo ético »
The foreign minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity « is an ethical imperative » para todo democratic state.
In this sense, explained that sería un mistake to link the cooperation with paises developing times of economic boom, because it is a “ obligación permanente ».
Jiménez considered that microcredit suponen « una política seria y rigurosa devoted to eradicate poverty ”, and now “ ever more ” developed governments must work under criteria of solidarity and not let ésta sea víctima cuts.
Para Spain, microcredit consisting of “ a major lines of development cooperation ”.
Por su parte, Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded « success ” of “ confidence ” to the people “ excluded whom all the doors »; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Lions of the Riva, welcomed the present to a city which « opens its gates caught the spirit of solidarity ».
The CDU propone elect the President european sufragio universal
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has taken place without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and presidenta Party 's Christian Democrat.
Initially had not been included in the order of the day, the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular for satisfacer to militants who believe that the government 's policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and podría serlo in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted prácticamente por unanimidad.
Of 1.001 delegates, only se registraron nueve votos against and 10 abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and after hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, europhile cleared out any possible doubt.
The main thrust of the Chancellor, and of the motion, resumen in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe. ”
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because « nueve million jobs depend directly on the euro. ”
Para Chancellor, “ the time has come to lead the way in Europe. ”
This could result in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon in order to grant reforzar control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but I could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission for sufragio universal para « making it a reality to Europe. ”
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Sin doubt, it is improbable for 27 to arrive quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain hostile to him y leaders of the CDU parecen saber que Nicolas Sarkozy also.
Pero the ball on the ground.
Por otro side, the delegates have rejected por una overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank in terms of weight of each economy, which obviously reforzaría Germany 's weight.
Eager to calm down on the inside of her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is seeking to win his Congress at the expense of the “ small ” países or european countries in difficulties prepared to criticise the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of “ friendship Franco - german », Angela Merkel has not - discussed to France.
Salvo in passing.
Recordando que, two centuries ago, there was a sangrienta battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating for the army defeats Napoleon.
The incidence of fraud in the sick leave
Tras subsidies, the UMP and the government taking up ofensiva against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux para visitar una box responsable subsidies and family pronunciar un speech on the subject, as recurrente since 2007, the fight against the social fraud y the ayudantía.
In addition, to accompany tal ofensiva, that part of the desire to save a rigorous, but still recuerda an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First of all, for cuts presupuestarios: the government plans to impose private sector workers un fourth day of lack of power before taking the low.
In short, unless there is a convention of company specific, a worker falls ill que perdería four days of pay, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
Se trata a measure that could stir up a oleada of anger but one that can allow save 280 billion, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure to a more symbolic: imposing officials un day, remuneración in case of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days in the private sector).
As we discuss these issues, most vuelve to putting on the table is also the subject of the fraud, this time orientado towards the abuses of the low labour.
« Van will substantially increase the controls and, in addition, if discovered someone committing a fraud, must reimburse the sums », warned Xavier Bertrand talking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement parecen slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of low labour.
In fact, since 2002 realiza un seguimiento constant in this matter and have launched several ofensivas políticas que, normally have borne fruit.
The French are ill more than in the rest of Europe.
Look carefully, first, the national figures.
Según the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 was paid more than EUR 237 million entitlement por low labour.
Según the French Institute for Research and documentation of the economy 's health, subsidies for low representaron, in 2008, 5% of health spending, rising to 11.300 billion.
Of this sum, 46% up to maternity and por industrial accidents, while 54% is connected with the sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion.
Por, 2.5% of spending on health.
In 2010, the French have taken una average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group soul Consulting.
Una half that, without a doubt, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the syrian professional management Monster. com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 french employees surveyed said that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Otro study, in this case the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the sick leave tuvieron una less than eight days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were longer.
Si compared with our european neighbours, french workers are not more likely than in other areas to get sick leave.
Un long study in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall lack of work (both in razones health and other oscilaba), in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to a 20% and a 28% in Denmark, a 15% Kingdom and between a 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.
The fraud is un - fairly limited.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of the sick leave of more than 45 few days will be sistemáticos.
In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in a 13% of the 285.000 realizados, that the low short - term were “ unjustified o » too long, which is to say, 37.050 cases.
In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were “ properly tailored o unjustified; a figure, taking in transactions un total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132.
Por, makes a total of 169.000 cases unjustified » between several millions of workers that they took a sickness.
Sin doubt, a figure insignificant in comparison with, for example, the work in the black.
Según the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, the practice representaría unas pérdidas income tax of 9 - 15 billion euros per year, which is more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, no doubt, considerably more than the fraud in the latter.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to fix its economy.
This is what declared on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament, he added, too, that the 100 days have given its government union would be sufficient to achieve that goal.

The right - wing rechaza nuevas austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the group, showed on Monday their support for the measures already adopted for trying to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his partido will not commit to additional austerity measures.
« We will not vote in favor of new measures ”, said during a meeting with members of his party « nueva democracy. ”
Señaló que was in line with the goals of reducing the deficit and the debt, as well as in the fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and the EU will not desbloquearían the loan of 8 billion required without una written guarantee of the all - party support for the measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that su palabra suficiente y que sería not sign anything because of foreign pressure.
Un experts say that should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide
The Canadians viven denying the death, according to the report from the Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the committee reclama que governments, institutions of health care and the doctors are working together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.

With medication or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
Y, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians wish to die at home, the 68,6% of them just die in hospital.
As a whole, the highest rate in this sense the registra Quebec, where a 86% of casualties occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and the suicide attended, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it wants to amend the penal code in connection with the euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Sin embargo, according to the experts, who also have studied the situation in all the countries where such practices have been legalized o does not constitute a criminal offence, there is no proof that the fact that there are not considered a criminal offence has not led to a abuse of its implementation, that is, the use of euthanasia and the suicide seen with people not competent or que had not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co - author of the report, said yesterday by teleconferencia que, on the contrary, more observaban excesses in those countries that have not been legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.
« In Canada practica euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal ”.
« In Canada practica assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal ”, explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians, pro - euthanasia
Recordemos que 85% of Canadians ya se have spoken out in favour of euthanasia, since opinan que permitiría people whose death be close alleviate their suffering, according to indicate a survey of Angus Reid realizada in 2010.
In addition, 66% believes that the fact of legalising euthanasia will not to understand that people 's lives are elderly or disabled tiene less value.
As for the people who have assisted suicide, 41% of respondents opina que should not open a proceso against them.
In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, between its recomendaciones sugieren que se listed on the criminal code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence.
The panel of experts pide also formed to healthcare professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rechace care at the end of their lives without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the committee reclama que governments, institutions of health care and the doctors are working together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Por último, in connection with sedation paliativa o terminal. it is already employed at length in the health institutions of Canada, the committee pide que, except that sirva para reducir the physical pain, should be considered as euthanasia and se someta the same procedures.
Experts say reservas otros
Otros experts in the field of the right health ya have expressed their reservations in connection with the conclusions of the report by experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in right of health, has described as “ extreme » the position of the experts who concluded the report, among other things, because not only the practice of euthanasia to patients in terminal decline.
« This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and tenga more than 18 years can help to pedir suicidarse », says Deschamps, who consulted resumen yesterday 's report.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy sobre any other value of society.
Now, adding that “ in society, there are labels and limitations ».
The health law specialist in Margaret Somerville también « expressed his strong opposition » with respect to the report 's conclusions, which he described as “ manifesto for euthanasia ».
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, calls into question, especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide son legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

Un scientific ruso has collaborated with the iranian nuclear programme
Un scientific ruso, Vycheslav Danilenko, has worked with Iran in the development of a detonator that se puede utilizar with a nuclear weapon, according to said Monday an NGO american specialising in the nuclear risk.
Para the identification of the investigator, the Institute for Science and International seguridad (ISIS) is based in a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and in other documents issued by the agency of the UN.
The IAEA said last week his « serious concern » por una « posible dimension military ” of the iranian nuclear programme.
Según ISIS, based at length in documents from the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, have trabajado for three decades, since the 1960s, in a soviet military nuclear station in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had been involved in the manufacture of diamonds sintéticos por explosion.
In 1989, or 1991, have left the centre to form a company focused on production of “ Nano » in Kiev.
The economic problems of their company would have led to contact, in 1995, with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Then, it is believed that cooperated with the iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA says that there are “ clear indications that Iran is developing ” un sistema of nuclear detonation « with the help of an expert abroad, that not only he knew well the technique, but also, according to un Member State to the agency, worked for most of his career in this technology in the nuclear programme military of their country of origin. ”

Austria
Introducing a “ regla presupuestaria of gold ” in the Constitution
The government of great social democrat coalition / Christian Democrat que is in power in Austria has decided Tuesday to include in the Constitution a « regla of gold ” presupuestaria para reducir the public deficit and, as well, to avoid a possible deterioration of the note soberana of Austria by rating agencies (triple a).
It was the same Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision following a Council of Ministers, when the austrian public debt stands at 74.6%, a figure far superior to the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
« Si se redujese the solvency of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pagar EUR 3 billion more in interest every year ”, said the Christian Democrat Vice - Chancellor of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responde so at the request of the Brussels summit to the countries of the euro area Member of the past 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government asked the inclusion, before the end of 2012, to reduce the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with value equivalent.
The device adopted by the austrian government closer to the “ german model ”, as Germany was the first country in Europe to adopted this kind of “ regla ».
By 2017, the public deficit structural should reduce each year in a 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the public deficit structural federal state should not exceed every year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should submit presupuestos balanced.
The aim is that, by 2020 / 2021, the public debt is reduzca under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.

Before the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009, the dollar contributed to around 120 yen y the euro to more than 160 yenes.
This explosion of the currency perjudica Japan 's exports in the archipelago, as more expensive products made in Japan y reduce the value of the revenue abroad by japanese companies when converted to the national currency.
Japan is struggling to « reconstruirse » tras the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the region of Tohoku (NE), Noda stressed, which fears that the rise of the yen Court roots of the weak recuperación.
Ranked third global economic growth has recovered in the third quarter (a 1.5% compared with the previous trimestre), for the first time in a year, thanks to a rise in exports and the consumption of households affected by the disaster.
Pero the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the “ economic foundations of Japan. ”

Política energy:
The facts should be more than the dogmas
Si there is a subject that cannot be treated teniendo considerations into account of the short term or simplemente pensando on emotions, is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects purchasing power and in the competitiveness of businesses.
Resulta proper for a meeting out will be the time to think about tales issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The exclusively resultará útil si studying all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinión in objective facts, in data racionales.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic trends supondrá duplication of demand for electricity by 2050, unless it is prive to a huge share of the world 's population of a vital element.
At the same time, must be filled the increasing scarcity of resources fossil fuels in order also to seguir produciendo electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Por this, Germany permanece sola in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its way to the need to find a source capable of replacing or Switzerland, which only tiene por objetivo power stations built in the last generation.
Por otro side, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, are moving with determination with their projects.
The United States, for their part, after Fukushima decided to add a unidad its parque, picking up the construction of a power cut off after the accident at Three Mile Island.
Si the german model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes as an example, the reality va against such a speech.
The choice of Berlin va to lead to a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence por increased the need for imported gas, in particular Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions per plant construction of gas and coal.
In a few months, notarán the harmful effects.
We must think sobre Denmark 's case.
European champion in the wind, of which obtiene 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the great usuarios of coal and gas intermitencia due to the wind, and for that reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the european average.
Por instead, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours militate in favour of electricity bill un 40% higher to the homes of the French.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key component of the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the utility industry in the national territory, the french companies benefit from cheaper electricity in Europe.
Por that reason, any reduction significativa of nuclear energy supondría una sharp rise in the price of electricity, which restaría realismo to the wonderful statements on industrialization of our country and the defence of our power purchasing power.
Se trata a price the vast majority of the French are refusing to pay and, in fact, not oposición por principio to this type of energy polls show.
Recordemos que energy policy in our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125 puestos working director and 410.000 indirect jobs.
Widely orientado export, covers a galaxy of SMES specialising in the international markets and does not create jobs pueden relocatable.
Si France decided to abandon nuclear energy, sacrifice a lot of these SMES and the loss of 6 billion annually in french exports of equipment and services nucleares.
¿What would an electrician un EPR designed to operate sesenta years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer?
Para solucionar the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is not a miracle source of electricity production, and it is not a source devilish.
The development by Areva solutions with low co2 emissions, nuclear y renovables, shows the complementary nature of the sources of energy.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintaining the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security exercises control strict and transparent tanto sobre existing plants as on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, recognized profesionalidad, are also obsesionados por security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Tan solo uno, the Three Mile Island, took place in a normal operating conditions; t the consequences and for the people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and to human error unforgivable.
At Fukushima, some people seem to be olvidar que the accident due to two natural disasters of a scope, which resulted in the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and operators and developers, the french and german EPR presenta un design able to withstand such phenomena.
While they studied by all the players want to build an electric power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville sería un great gift for competitors from Areva and EDF, as it would leave them vía free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear industry.
Resulta necessary and legitimate to seek the best options for energy for nuestro país, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and manoeuvring partisanas dominasen un debate as important for the economic situation, social and financial of our country.
Immigration, a burden or a oportunidad para economy?
Immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised partiendo from various points of view: the saturation of police services, administrative and judicial sometidos policy figures, the compatibility of this policy, with the status of self - proclaimed “ country of human rights ” of France.
More recently, is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have jumped back into the headlines, with the interior minister (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclamando past que France “ does not need foreign talentos, Workers and waiters ».
Sin embargo are rarely the moment analyses from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a lot of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the guidance declaring in 1976 which « 900 unemployed should not be a problema para que un país has almost two million workers immigrants ”, while on the left, it set the tone, Michel Rocard, explaining that France “ cannot take charge for the misery of the world ” in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right who shared the fear of the invasion of the territory national una multitude of polish plumbers.
On both sides, and it is felt that immigrants are a burden for the economy and society in France.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they operate with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande se confined to include trivia, indicating that the co - development permitirá solucionar “ problema of migration ”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps resulta rentable electorally, but economically sale very expensive.
Tal as economists Ian Goldin y Geoffrey Cameron on a building site reciente que resume knowledge most recent immigration (Exceptional People: how Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists in the positive impact of the migratory flows in economic growth, the wage and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
The limitation of immigration perjudica weakens growth and employment.
The fears relating to the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea that these can sustituir for national workers, in particular the poorly skilled, by pressing to que se reduzcan sus salarios.
Pero experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are more complementary sustitutos of workers and national exercise principalmente profesiones in sectors with the lack of jobs.
Immigrants poco qualified trabajan in sectors that do not attract workers and more skilled in sectors where the dynamic training does not meet the demand of staff.
Un positive effect on salaries
In the same way that a surgeon tendría difficulty working one that will be lack of anestesistas, complementarity between national and immigrants provoca que the arrival of the past have an impact on wages and the use of the national.
Teniendo all this in mind, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase of migratory flows presents una subida in real wages in the long - term of between 0.6 un y 0.9%.
Y, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants are making contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (there is a large share Nobel Prize y naturalized american companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay y Yahoo was founded by immigrants).
The migrants also son net contributors to the social systems, since they bring to a 1% of the total budget in european countries.
The International Labour Organisation estimates that, for example, in Germany by immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years realizará una contribution net income (less) expenses of EUR 150 public budgets on average during his lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek points of growth that he lacked « teeth ».
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, only you need to think in a european democracy
Democracy is a precious thing, but also fragile.
The european continent should be able to remember this, even though it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarismos, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some might think that, for democracy triunfase definitely sobre sus enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way to posible.
Sabemos, from Napoleon « the Petit », that it was in mind.
The universal suffrage, although this is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and could even become a “ tool of oppression » said, formerly the philosopher republicano Etienne Vacherot.
No, the democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation un y control a separation of powers, an education, Luces, solidarity economic and social justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is on the verge of becoming a political crisis and democratic.
The greek referendum palinodia verdadero - false tuvo, in this regard, a dual effect revelador: it showed the need of a return of the political sphere potente, but also the worrying sensación of its failure, their inconsistency.
To consider this ambivalence para superarla.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle have now been moved, and que, in many cases, the soldiers republicanos ya not moving in the right direction.
We will not come out to gain if we demand a sucesión national referendums, organized on the basis of the needs and in disarray.
Una blank cheque to the monarch european all or un high into the void of the hole nationalist: what opciones para the citizen!
No, we do not want to drive coups effect, but a joint exercise, full, calm and steady, choices and democracy, this time at european level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, have no idea where to end the list), because only there is a crisis, Europe 's crisis.
The whole of Europe is the pliega on the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which already suffering from su su impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers una humiliation in the international arena.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe which is the great loser slowly sovereignty and, with it, each of their nations.
The most urgent is that popular sovereignty recupere over the helm of the european project.
Porque únicamente together can they Europeans reducir the weight of its debts, freed from the markets and preparar su future through investment.
The way out of the crisis requerirá decisions at european level that cannot be taken sin una democratic legitimacy, except that total sea para lead to disaster.
Tras have long struggled against this proposal for the Socialists and Jacques Delors, all calling for a european economic governance.
Que.
Pero pensar in it without una greater political integration and democratic - without the vivida as such by the citizens, it would be a nueva madness and will lead a new died.
We must take a new stage of european integration.
Para build the Republic in France, was necessary « republicanos do ”.
The revolution is motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson sigue siendo applicable.
We need to build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Únicamente se podrá achieve building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real soberanía popular european.
Para build Europe, let Europeans.
Cards with chip « generalize se sin contact ”
The Salon World cards chip se begins Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an environment optimista.
In fact, the 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with chips (tarjetas bank, telephones SIM card, etc.), with a total of 6 million units, according to the calculations of the cabinet Eurosmart.

Su quota should continue to rise in 2012 (prevén 580 million units) and representar roughly 10% of the global market for cards with chip (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long rezagada with regard to the Asia - Pacific region, is gaining ground in the sector of the payment sin contact.
Around 26 million bank card Visa ya have this role, which is accepted in 75 terminales payment.
In France, their start - up phase is more modest: they are using 400 tarjetas Visa sin contact.
Pero hypermarkets trabajan por four.
Carrefour has issued this year, 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard sin contact.
Para put the gear, however, it is necessary that the banks put them at the disposal of its customers.
There are two major « establishments french have committed themselves to disseminate sistemáticamente in the future, among its customers, cards with banking system 's sin contact ” announces Gérard Nébouy, director general of Visa Europe, France.
The banks prueban payment for teléfono mobile
Pero tan solo is a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with the technology Near Field Communication (NFC), essential to make transactions.
« Se are rezagando ».
Pero « should finally experience verdadero boom the next year ”.
« Prevemos que se venderán between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 in the whole world, ” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.

The Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front va on the rise
Paris preocupa por links between Al Qaeda in the Maghreb and islamic sect Boko Haram.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and nigerian sect Boko Haram, on which sospechaba for some time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Algerian Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even argued that Algiers ya « tiene certainty ».
« The way in which both organisations operan y the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating », he said, without providing further details.
Paris it seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two frenchmen in Niger last January have reanudado the gateways.
Raptados in a restaurant in Niamey por personas relacionadas with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour y Vincent Delory died the next day, along with several of its secuestradores following an operation launched by french special forces.
In the rubble of the speech, the researchers discovered french and nigerian varios chips telefónicos que pertenecían terrorists.
Axis terrorista
The study indicates calls made to several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
Según radio France Internationale (RFI), numbers embezzled especially the interest of the researchers: one leads to a nigerian que permaneció for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, presumably, is close to Aqmi y to the sect.
« Se trata progress, but certainly we must expect to have more formal pruebas before talk of operational cooperation between Aqmi y Boko Haram ».
Pero « is possible ”.
« We know for years that the sect enjoys financial support and intellectual and is becoming increasingly active ”, says Kunle Amuwo, a researcher in Nigeria.
In recent months, these “ support » had been increasingly evident in the development and the speeches of Boko Haram o in their ways operativos, now involving the use of suicide bombers o explosive devices and increasingly complex in the same way that those used for Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, is since then to presionando Abudja para que tenga account of the problems created by Boko Haram.
The nigerian authorities, in fact, have long been considered the group as a community of enlightened poco worthy of interest.
Un éxito rápido
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri on a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, “ western education is a sin »), it calls for the establishment of an islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this region pobre, the association is experiencing a éxito rápido.
Se politiza y requires a respeto strict Sharia law, while its militant throw to the fight against the central government godless.
The latter orientan firstly to churches, bars, to the authorities.
In 2009, the militant Boko Haram were particularly assets and increased attacks on police stations.
The reaction of Abudja was, as so often happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and registraron 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested in life, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect se radicaliza y abandons its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, claims un attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, later, another in Abudja.
In June, Boko Haram vuelve to attack against Abudja, particularly against the headquarters protegido police, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the headquarters of the United Nations makes its primary objective International.
The creation of an axis terrorista in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia pasando por Nigeria, worried about all the specialists in security.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and que Somalis al - Chebab operan in Kenya, Boko Haram surge as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram y said he was willing to “ share all the information. ”
The world according to republican candidates for the presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry in rivalizan simpleza y lack of knowledge.
Una America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas o even simplistas?
Listening to the republican candidates para presidential, voters podrían pensar que is as well.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates ever more statements thunderous y shortcuts in terms of foreign policy, traditionally strong un punto Republicans.
Se spread mottos, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, the aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination by the “ Grand Old Party », has threatened to lead to the Chinese to the WTO and denouncing them « por manipulation of its currency », a key issue in an exasperated America por the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
DA if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to Obama in China and the only candidate that posee una visión sofisticada of foreign policy, is nearly drowns in an attitude that « apabulla » emotions.
He asked for a firm, but a constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
Pero Huntsman, that it falls flat in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney también has promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
« Si salgo elected to go to Iran, ” fanfarroneó.
« Si Obama sale reelegido, will have the bomb ”.
Prometió also increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet their obligations in relation to appears that.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second candidate best classified, shows for su parte un vergonzoso ignorance of such topics.
Recientemente, urged to counter the threat of chinese military porque « Beijing is trying to develop nuclear capability », apparently ignoring the fact that China has nuclear military since 1964.
Governor Rick Perry tejano, which supports Israel and quiere intervene in Iran, says that, for its part, is ready to deploy the US army in Mexico to combat drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists', prohibited by Obama in 2009, also preconizan Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are significant with the republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, peso pesado in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President Reagan told that simple ideas y que también tenía won the Cold War.
Recuerdan que Obama himself was an amateur and que tuvo que loosen the pistón in the fight against terrorism.
They insist, rightly, on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, at the exit of the “ boys precipitada » of Iraq and in their tergiversaciones in Libya, and labeled as weak.
Pero attacks are not sencillos.
The population of judges in a way rather positivo the balance sheet of national security of Obama, who finished with Bin Laden.
In Iraq, is wary of the military interventions which generate a collapse.
And, arguing that we need America to economically reconstruir resucitar su leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
Nord Stream, New puerta entry of russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which communicates directly with Western Europe Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is already has put into service.
Must supply gas for the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event, with great pomp.
On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra un y sensitive bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, the new communicates directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Simbólicamente, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the french prime minister François Fillon y su counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have been together the steering wheel of the heart valve que controls the entry of russian gas in the network of Western Europe.
With this new pipeline, each year will reach 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas to Western Europe additional through a first tuvo of 1.224 km to communicate the St Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg - Pomerania.
Un segundo tubo should be completed by the end of 2012 permitirá suministrar un total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is to say, enough to cover all the french consumption.
In addition, are already talking about the possibility of building a tercer tubo por the same recorrido.
Para Gazprom on time, the completion of this enormous building site presenta redolent of victory.
Poland and the baltic countries will had fought firmly to the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream va to allow suministrar gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course terrestre por terceros países (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries pierden something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia amenazándola shut with access to the markets of western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate in comparing the Nord Stream as a “ nuevo pacto german - soviet », in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin para ocupar Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, support the project ruso, has obtained a greater security of supply.
Pero price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between the Eastern and western Europeans.
Russia has managed in just five years, ensuring the victory su visión of an alliance between Russia and wealthy western countries, big consumers and gas reserves in increasingly limited.
« This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery que unites us organically », François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the pipeline, showing how the big contracts sector gas are tan políticos as economic.
This explains the broad todo sonrisas on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of the pipeline will also supone un technical achievement.
The handset submarino is made of steel recubierto of cement for protegerlo against the anchors of the ships.
Se supports at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 metres.
Para build it, it was necessary to avoid areas of mines that date back to the Second World War.
« It necessary to withdraw o destroy a hundred of them, by precaución », says Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream.
Also, it was necessary to step up measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The handset is a long serpiente of metal that pesa as 242 torres Eiffel and is not interrupted in all its length: or válvulas, or by station maintenance.
Scheduled una plataforma control in the waters of Sweden, but leaders of the project to the same renunciaron to see that the swedes were not very willing allowing a sociedad Russian State se established permanently in the sea off the coast.
« In case of outages, stop the passage of gas in less than a minute ”, precise Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline was released, therefore, to the atmosphere.
Pero manufacturers see poco probable que se produzca una flight, as planned junturas que, according to forecasts, will have a brain drain every 100,000 years ago.
State control of the pipeline was guaranteed by a robot submarino, pulled down by un ship, which carries out foreign inspections, as well as through a device that touring the home of the pipeline.
In the form of pure, it introduces inside the tubo, which has a diameter of a metre, and moves with the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travelling at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on posibles deformities of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to function during 50 years without any kind of repair.
The movement of the gas is simply guarantees por pressure.
The principle is 200 bars y at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to be able to carry out this project.
The company leader is Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
To her, they joined the german E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the dutch Gasunie y the group French GDF Suez (9% each).
These five sociedades have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploit the pipeline.
Tiene su sede Zoug in Switzerland, where the imposition resulta particularly favourable.
Later, Gazprom hired in this society, over a period of 25 years renovable, the entire transport capabilities of gas.
« A Gazprom repay them por the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas realmente se transporte », precise Jens Müller.
Financing the construction of the pipeline is carried out by 30%, with the input of shareholders and 70% with loans.
The total cost of the project should reach 7.4 million euros for two tubos.
Para GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached the 240 million.
Pero minority shareholders are certain that must not exceed su investment, as Gazprom sí solo takes over the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin, in a sandy coastline plantada pine.
Unas válvulas, with 4.5 metres high, are the exit door of gas.
There are some sensores que measured the temperature and pressure, the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before transfiera pipelines to the Germans.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal recibe un million cubic meters of russian gas every hour.
Totally at capacity, will be tres million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a book brand.
Set up a half - century by una italian company, Moleskine quiere get people a taste for writing.
Tiene un air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a vela.
The book Moleskine se reconoce easily, with their pastas rectangulares black, his rubber, their sheets of white color roto, as ageing por time.
Sin embargo, Moleskine books with the current were born … in 1997.
The italian company way way, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch the market a book of letters of design, but distinguished.

Que un éxito provoca envy: in the autumn of 2006, way, way was acquired by the investment fund Personal Capital Europe, currently Syntegra capital, written a new página in the history of Moleskine.
¿Por qué, the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities sigue siendo tan high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th semana para employment of the disabled begins today.
In spite of a public policy resuelta, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities, twice the average rate: a 19%, compared to 9% for the whole of the population.
¿Desalentadora?
« Not, ” says Éric Blanchet, the director general of Adapt, the association organiza a week for the use of the disabled.
« The progress made in the last 15 years are considerable.
« Back then, the unemployment rate was not sino tres veces two times higher than the average.
« Sin, however, there is still much to do. ”
It is worth mentioning that the unemployed disabled siguen face many barriers para access to employment.
Suelen tener una older: 37% are over 50 years (a 17% on average).
Poseen un poco high level of skill: 80% has not ended the Baccalaureate and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 disabled son.
Por último, long - term unemployment is rife among them: the 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is to say, there are many issues that difficult, especially the return to the world of employment and which « form the crux of the problem, ” Christian señala Grapin, director general of Tremplin, a partnership created in 1992 to help companies to hire workers with disabilities.
These are the obstacles objetivos.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mindset of the people, but it is moving too slowly.
Un study conducted in April by the association IMS Entreprendre para - the Cité señalaba que directors surveyed tienen « un level of knowledge about disabilities under », with a “ representación excessive people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual ».
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of recruiting a 6% of workers disabled goal set in a law … to 1987.
Según the latest figures available, which date back to 2008, attain a relación of 2.6%.
« Now reached around 3% ”, says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting the contributions of the businesses that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishment sometidos » contribution to this, as well as the funds disbursed, have fallen between 2007 and 2011, from 59 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
« The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure on businesses ”, explains Pierre Blanc.
Pero « this also improves refleja una verdadera awareness, particularly among large groups ”.
Según the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the societies that poseen between 20 and 49 trabajadores account with disabled employees on its staff, compared with 82% of companies between 100 and 199 trabajadores.
“: “ A joy ”
To face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), “ Eden y Georges Leekens not hiding a pleasure to create this party.
We dare not say that it noted collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sentados uno next to each other, on the floor of the audience in the Stade de France, Georges Leekens y “ Eden realmente have made peace.
Five months after the gesture of ill will from their front against Turkey, the belgian seleccionador has only praise for él.
« I was a lot of Eden, for their progresos y porque sea belgian ”.

Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal 's Paulo Bento se faces with a great deal of optimism for the return against Bosnia (22h00), which is to be held Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the IDA, lacked the realismo to both teams.
« Have elapsed will we these 90 minutes we be team happy and, above all, a country happy. ”
Paulo Bento ya se ve in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selecçao, which runs from September 2010, will qualify para Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separan Portugal from happiness.
Pero there is one party que un play and rival, Bosnia, which defeated.
Teniendo account of the IDA (0 - 0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the thing is not determined.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not make the valuable que goal would have been quiet.
« Is a good result, but at the same time may pose a risk, because we do not have set out of the house. ”
Pero at home, in the stadium in the bright light of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced of, in front of a crowd que should be just as excited, even if it is clear that the party is very « matched », dixit un Bento optimista pero lucid.
« We hope that the party is very equalized, but we are absolutely convinced that we can lead the tomar », declared the coach portugués of 42 years.
« Following teniendo un 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012 ”, has, however, relativizado 's successor Carlos Queiroz.
The standoff Friday in Bosnia obliga to the Portuguese to brand and to win.
The Bosnians could reach a draw, although they also have need to score.
« Is a good result, but at the same time may pose a risk, because we do not have set out of the house, ” regrets Bento.
« Vamos to play against a team that posee una great technical quality and que available players with a great quality individual ”, he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercise, from the outset, a pressure maxim about Bosnia to not leave them to think « tiempo ».
Una good idea, provided that, this time, is realistic.
