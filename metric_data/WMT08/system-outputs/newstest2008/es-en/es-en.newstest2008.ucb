European inflation it slid in food
Accelerating inflation, recorded in the euro area, you must first of the rapid growth of the price of food products.
The price increases in November has been superior to the expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after the 2.6 percent of October - inflation averaging 3.1 percent - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts gave only as likely a 3% - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike banks emitters American, British and Canadian cut, not the basic interest, claiming the decline, together with rising prices of raw materials and forced reduction of unemployment, would invite a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least around 2%.
According to a analyst, the ECB is in the trap 22: "We must negotiate" on inflation so that they will not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, beating the record of twelve years old; while in Espana increased from 3.6 at 4.1 percent.
Inflation were shot in the euro area to rampant food and energy prices.

Gallup provides a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for early December the support of the alliance of young Democrats increased significantly, at its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced so low-13 per cent - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of voters certain parties - due to the more firmness voters of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two-thirds (a 71 percent) with the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the democratic Forum and the alliance of the Free Democrats not met or the limit needed to make any parliamentary escano: its support within the entire population is 2%.
Among voters insurance is one percent more sympathetic on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point pre-has never been so high, a 41% the proportion of those who particularly bad judged the economic situation in the country, while another by 46% believes that the situation is bad enough.
Families, after expectations more promising spring and summer, are now more pessimistic in exchange for their own economic situation.
With regard to the next minister, the majority of the population with the deterioration of the situation and just one - tenth expected an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the consulted, figure greater than any previous survey of Gallup, estimated that President of government rather desempena evil that function well.
13% of the consulted trust or entrusts much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, Viktor Orbán in both the backing of the 38 percent of the consulted.
A 54% of the population does not trust the absolute head of government and a 27 percent does not trust the President of the alliance of the young democrats.
One of the indicators of shaping the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced vis - à-vis the person of the head of government without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last Minister 35 percent an estimated that it would be desirable to keep the power of the government and the head of government, this proportion is currently only 20%, so that the relative majority (a 33 percent) believe that the only solution is new elections.
The interest of the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60% of the respondents to the question of participation responded that participate surely and another 20% said that it is likely to participate.
In comparison, as "general elections to be held this Sunday" security participate with only a 55 percent of the population and another 15% believes likely their involvement. On the basis of the current intentions voters there is no doubt the outcome of the popular consultation.
A 74 percent of the population dim view the payment of the rights of studies, a 79 percent of the service of medical consultations and a 84 percent of the hospital care.
If we look at these proportions solely participants safe in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, payment by the medical consultations and the hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan Tesco, has its price fivefold
Increased held the average level of the price of a percent of the 16 supermarkets trade triangle gold Budaörs, with the difference that this Minister has not increased VAT.
Article Napi Gazdaság
This Minister also increased by an average of 16 percent in the trade triangle gold Budaörs the usual canasta Christmas Napi's diary, but in all supermarkets growth recorded a far superior to the thousand HUF.
As in December of last Minister had already been fired prices in supermarkets of food, so it is not experienced a percentage dramatic increase in comparison with the high starting point.
However, it is obviously chilling to consumers the fact that what the last minister could buy at a price well below the nine thousand HUF, today it can do not by ten thousand.
The canasta of Napi in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF psychological limit ten thousand HUF.
canasta and the highest value was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that canasta Minister cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of spirits unique event and fish remained almost at the level of previous minister, but there was a sharp increase in steak of pechuga of Turkey, the nuts and the seeds of poppy.
The price of bread wheat flour and followed the data from the central Bureau of statistics, though in the Auchan also have found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition does not cut the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
Equally was surprising in this shop than the price of Coca-Cola with bottle redimible gallons of two cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost just 257 HUF.
Yet, in the canasta of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheaper.
According to our calculations, with regard to the price of Christmas Minister of the past, Cora increased with a 15, while and Auchan Tesco with nearly a 18% prices that figure in canasta of Napi.
Comparing the values of the most expensive canasta Minister of the past with the canasta cheaper, the Minister of this difference has been a 12 percent, while growth cheaper between the Minister of the past and the more expensive this Minister has been a 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
The minister past average growth of prices was 1206 HUF, so that during the Christmas Minister of the past in prices was the rise of VAT.
It is precisely this process was that smashing trade, visibly supermarkets were unable to take a decision on the scope of prices to apply for each product and calculating the effect of change of prices on consumption.
(If the planned trader wrong the speed of the movement of a product, may lose an important benefit in the room that fits the turnover.)
The increase in the price of canasta of Napi reached such extremes to increase VAT, the more expensive was superior with 1720 HUF value recorded in 2006, while in the cheaper difference was just a 844 HUF.
This minister is not produced such extreme, because the highest price of has now been 1630 HUF more than the minister past and cheaper also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two seasons navidenas, growth recorded a catastrophic in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets grew over 30% the price of articles of consumption of first need.
(But this does not necessarily confirms the numbers of the central statistics office: this office, in the case of some food first need recorded in the meantime 12 months an increase of higher price by 30%.
For example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the canasta of Napi, in this case, this seems almost impossible, for in the price of this product that was quite expensive because the minister past compared to the basis, recorded, at worst barely 10% of rising prices.
According to all the indices, suppliers of flour have a stronger position than the egg could impose the dramatic increase in prices even multinationals.
The hypermarkets not complain in the trade triangle of gold, constantly talking about positive results.
According to our experiences collected, the majority of consumers of the three visited shops, no longer care about prices.
Of all the products they buy large numbers, raising by paletas food maintained.
In the manana on Wednesday, in the three large shops are formed lines ahead of the boxes because increased suddenly the number of customers.
However, we have information that inside the country volumes of sale are lower, multinational numerous complain institutes survey because incomes are below its plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the appliances.
In many hospitals are saves with organophosphorous
This Minister have occurred in hospitals several thousand infections produced at first by the improper use of antibiotics.
The ruling hygiene circumstances in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overload the staff not encourage control of infection - affirms the Department of medical - woman center for national epidemiology.
In many hospitals are saves even with the organophosphorous.
Not long ago diagnosed with MRSA contagion in the Department of traumatología János hospital.
In a man hospitalizado after a serious accident was detected the presence of the bacterium resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same sort of contagion occurred in this same hospital minister in the early.
A car accident gravely wounded high gave the hospital and the same patient shortly after should return to hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then has not been able to make an important surgery for the presence of the bacterium in their bodies.
Until the 10 December this Minister have occurred in the national surveillance Nosocomialis 1094 cases of infection hospital produced by agents multiresistant - said Karolina Böröcz, medical - woman's Department center for national epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals certainly recorded this number of infections produced by multiresistant agents, the rest is not has information.
Nearly two-thirds of infection cases (683) should be the MRSA, i.e. by Staphylococcus aureus resistant, methicillin - oxacilina.
A third of human beings have their nose the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without any cause disease.
Infection produced by the SA (for example flash.: throat, amigdalitis infections, skin infections, wounds) react to antibiotics and are easily treatment.
However, once applied exaggerated or unduly to antibiotics, bacteria normally react to antibiotics, it into bacteria very resistant to antibiotics and contagian rapidly in hospital conditions inadequate.
Can cause serious hospital infections, for example infections wounds or blood poisoning first patients with transitional or chronic immunodeficiency patients with the body weakened, or elderly people of little weight.
In view of the director of the hospital János medical - there is nothing special MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA only is absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where not examined its presence.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff you at them and rubber kid mask antibiotics and there are suitable for treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients hospitalized are reviewed previously to verify the presence of MRSA in his body, but even then can we avoid the infection in all cases.
It is fashionable take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however present circumstances not encourage national hospital for prevention of training and the transmission with pathogens multiresistant - claims Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection was produces fundamentally in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals, should consider patients hospitalized and isolate immediately the enfermes inside the MRSA body.
However, in hospitals Hungarians is not fashionable taking microbiológicas samples.
This fact is also due to the national health system not financed these medical examinations.
So the majority of cases out into the open when there are already visible MRSA infections of the patient-in-chief of medical told the Department of epidemiological center.
The European Union is rigorous encomiendas for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infection and pathological cadres.
We must empenarse in which the antibiotic therapy directed, or should be done microbiological tests to prevent drug resistance to hospitals, but not fulfilling this demand.
Taking microbiológicas samples are even less frequent in the case of patients ambulantes or in basic health care - stated Karolina Böröcz.
It saves with organophosphorous
Experiments scientists have shown that in most cases of a patient MRSA is transmitted to another through health workers.
Therefore, a very important role desempenan laundering hands, the use of rubber kid and masks, but also in this respect are experiencing considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
The MRSA is transmitted through the transmission by drops and direct contact between people, but in the national hospital circumstances is not always possible to isolate the patient contagiado.
Moreover, Cinemas often hospitals are crammed, which are often very together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it may experience also - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of economic situation is less favourable saves with organophosphorous, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater chance for the infection.
In view of Karolina Böröcz, where they meet the appropriate preventive measures, are less infections of this kind or can stop the transmission of agent.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of infection with MRSA is a huge spending to the national health insurance, so that in all countries will fight against him.
In Britain, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program has apparently successes, according to the data supplied, infection with MRSA show tendency of decline in England.
The European Centre for disease prevention and control (ECDC) has among its priorities prevention multiresistant agents (among these the MRSA) and hospital infections are due to these pathogens.

Bulgaria, paradise EU housing
It is remarkable development Bulgarian housing market - the attention of all Europe is moving toward this Balkan country before little mentioned.
What, where buyers and in the market even cheaper of the EU, which is rapidly price?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of re-Max.
The goal preferred to the property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with their cheap apartments ski slopes and villa of beaches.
montanosas regions of Bansko, Borovec Pamprovo, and are the most Vitosa favourite, whereas in Albena beaches, the "golden coast", the "Sunshine Coast", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but increasingly people seeking estate also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts of re-Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central part of the country - as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - incite the interest of promoters housing and increasingly people buying property in the area especially cheap Rus.
Similarly, the capital can be inviting spaces Sofia, trade and offices promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive Golf havens for Europe, and thus a destination also highlighted during the other two stations, as well as the summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In view of the analysts, those who buy property in Bulgaria, also work to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are British come, but also in France, Belgium, Espana and increasingly of Romania.
They are also present promoters maltese and Cypriots traditionally clients and there are many Russians in the Black Sea beaches and ski havens.
The foreign clients may fall into three groups - says Georgi Jankov regional, director of re-Max in Bulgaria.
Those who seek to settle here expecting buy new or revised by a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad shape between 5 and 15 billion euros for renovarlas then.
Demand good communication and access to them, is closeness of a major city, shops and usually a local doctor.

Constitute the third group housing investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefit to medium or long term.
The price of buildings capitalinos goes in constant growth, the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union, Bulgaria has home prices lower, in the past five years old these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of buildings exceeds considerably wage growth.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
According to reported the environment minister and Hidrología Gábor Fodor the meetings at the level of experts will end Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime post-2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world deliberating about the road map Balí on that efforts following the period of reducing emissions, established in the Kyoto Protocol, valid until 2012.
Today is performed animated discussions about the particular among developing countries and industrialised.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment does not want to negotiate about accurate figures, although tends to reach agreement that in comparison with the situation in 1990, until the minister 2020 undercuts with 25 to a 40% emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for the.
Another major issue of the conference is that if the industrialized countries, in addition to reduce emissions, or are not willing to give material support and technological countries that need it.
A compromise was reached Moreover on aid to offer to developing countries.
The Fund support, laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, will be guided by a management board composed of 16 members, probably within the Global Fund for the environment of the UN (GEF) - writes the "is Piac profit."
The six by hundreds of Hungary
In the name of Hungary, the environment minister and Hidrología Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in the global protection of the climate and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared that the EU undertakes reduce until 2020, with regard to the level of 1990 20% their emissions of gas, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not the agreement on "post-2012" and is ready to engage in reducing even 30% if the other big developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with its responsibility and their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that countries signatories of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 undertook to fall in a 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states are committed to meet an 8% decrease.
The commitment of Hungary is down with a 6 percent emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect on the period between 1985 and 87, that our country - senala served the press release of the Ministry of environment.
The stakes are high in Balí, because within two years old will sign the international agreement on climate policy in the long run, because if not, it is certain that their entry into force would continue to after 2012. In this case reduction commitments undertaken in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of reducing emissions, whose need was an institution in its most recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the UN dealing with climate change, which received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Thus, reducing emissions would be a delay and could not prevent an increase of more than 2 or C of the average temperature of the earth, made by scientists have unfathomable and irreversible consequences.
The British army in Youtube recruit
The British army units in a distributor of video recordings of actions filmed published in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.

Operation in Afghanistan
Originally air force was charged with the videos recruitment goals, but in view of the Ministry of Defence serve also to present the public the real purpose of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda virtually costs nothing in comparison with conventional TV spots recruitment - declared the BBC the expert in defense Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably have some political message, because in a specific manner justify the reason for military action determined by the government.
Americans produced a videogame
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recordings recelosamente editadas censuradas and, in the distributor appear also videos fans, for example, on the death of soldiers propaganda films: in the official a bit hypocritical, talk as officers maximum losses, without presenting however the bloody part of the fighting.
Moreover, the battlefields Iraq and Afghanistan have borne the Internet because numerous videos engraved in real operations, but the British army just lately is taking this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly differently to recruitment with descargables gratuitously video games of gunfire denominated America's army, in the midst of a situation in which more or less real player can be directly instead of soldiers.

Instead, if adopted law, will gather commissions strike and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda on Monday of the National Assembly is also possible that only vote on the law of public health in hours very tickets night, or to the best nearly midnight.
As a result of the strike beginning on Monday, we must reckon with significant difficulties in transport: in the railways will be working indefinitely, for the manana may be to a part of the public transport in Budapest, and more than half of the city transport of Volán bus companies.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country will closure of half of the roads.

Political capital: in the country is increases the risk by the Hungarian guard
According to the division of analysis of risks (risk Analysing division) of the political capital Hungarian guard activity, constituted in August of this minister with the support of the movement for a better Hungary, from several views has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the "warning about risks being written companía": in connection with the operation of the Hungarian guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the escalation of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma Hungary, even in the short term will occur violent ethnic conflicts."
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this character - added the representative of the Institute of research.
Claimed that all this is one of the mistakes of the main players in political life Hungarian: "The protagonists of public life relented public discussion of the Roma problem representatives of the political groupings radical extremists, who could establish his political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarian."
This makes the problem, prevents any normal dialogue, empowers extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - estimates.
Moreover, according to the Institute of research, the activities of the National Guard, by consequence of the great attention of the national average and international deteriorated significantly, "the image of Hungary abroad, especially when it comes to the stability and democratic development of the country."
We remember that: from otono 2006 received growing advertising and momentum reorganization of radical groups and extreme right of Hungary, and that since the summer of 2007 were formed in the country numerous organizations autodefinen associations of "national self."
"The common feature of these bodies is that autodefinen civil organizations as openly proclaim, while the training of its members to defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defense, defence of public order), citing the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state" - added.
Claimed: all this occurs in accordance with the method that seeks to give a civil presentation at different political aspirations, based on the discontent with politics and society with political parties.
For emphasizing civilian and form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of the legal status, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian guard activity is a risk factor also from the standpoint of neighborly relations.
"In recent months, in numerous neighbouring states referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own policy anti-Hungarian with the establishment of the Hungarian guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region "- Agregaron.
According to the Institute of research, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that throughout the region increased the political risks.
Wrote that the Hungarian guard works in such a way that, for example, Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme right.
The Constitution of the Bulgarian guard must be massive unrest Gypsies produced in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Seizing this situation, UNB decided to provide the Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "the national self."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years old saw "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the political capital.
Agregaron: this initiative provoked a vivid discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As wrote, suggests increasing the risk of ethnic conflicts that certain Bulgaria's Roma organizations have announced that to resist, constitute its own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian guard until now has shown similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, cannot be excluded also Gypsies Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, organizing its own self-can read in the warning about the risks of political capital.
The director of research political capital, Attila Juhász to the question of news agency said: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the Institute of research.
As he said, every Minister publish their analysis of risks and when experience something that can influence the change of risk, information to the public, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The party is not always writes with red
In Hungary law defines precisely the days that writing with red in the timetable and has now become a widespread practice that around the days of party - that the next minister will be less - was reorganizan working days.
Even in the EU or in America are standardized parties.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, Party of state and gatherings hours.
Gatherings hours fundamentally are related to religious parties and historical efemérides.
The new Festejamos Minister also: both the last day Minister of the old, as the first day of the new minister is celebrated - Haider especially to relax the minister festejando that the old.
Throughout the eleven Minister have written festivities with red in the timetable.
It is national holiday 15 March in memory of the Revolution of 1848 and 23 October, Memorial hours of the Revolution of 1956.
The 20 August welcome the founding of the state, or May 1, the Party of work, or and 2 or 1 November we remember our family and friends deceased.
Moreover, in our country are festivities two days of resurrection Easter whit Monday, and the Christmas.
According to the timetable, our government parties, national or religious seldom coincide with a weekend, so often becomes bridge when before or after the party is a single workweek.
In exchange for the weekends alargados so during the previous Saturday cannot be ausentar of job or school.
Is the Minister of work that regulates in their specific decree when there are working hours exactly to change directly precedent or after the party.
This is obligatory legal norm for all employers and for their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not compulsory in exchange for enterprises and institutions of services that, owing to its role, even during the work ceaselessly gatherings hours.
This Minister the order of work can be changed only around the end of festivities Minister: from 24 December virtually stops life in the country, because according to the experiences, most people days ago during the bridge between Christmas and the end of the minister or make their vacations during these days.
The next several Minister of our parties will agree with the mid or with weekends, so that there will be less changes in working hours that this minister.
First will change the agenda around the Labour Party to then, during successive four days, can rest workers.
On Saturday, 26 April will workday, for that to change the Friday 2 may be holiday hours.
The other is related to change the party of October 23: Saturday 18 October, will work instead of Friday 24.
Instead, the next minister during the Party of the end of the minister can rest, because from 24 December will not be almost nowhere, even the last minister is a Wednesday.

Interest pierdes if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual backlog of manana.
It sounds a compass extrano violin on radio: with electronic effects.
Subo volume.
Changes the pace of music, and the previous tones add the low and then the voice of a chorus female as a real gem intervening.
The station mr2 reproduces singing wings of love of Zagar.
National musical life us not malcrió much with electronic pop quality.
But now seems utterly different this backlog when you are listening to the new disk of Zagar.
Appears Yonderboi songs. Some new and interesting of national digital underground are gradually changing the image of new and although it is fashionable rock style guitarras garages, breaks, the national pop electrical has shown: there is innovations under the sun.
Balázs Zságer launched his career in the city of Pécs touched, in the whole of Yonderboi until began its independent race perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of a whole.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, a mixture of jazz, electronics and pop music bailable, tried to succeed, when asked cinematographic soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public knew that the whole initially acted alone in clubs pequenos when the magazine wan2 selected his first disk published in 2002 among the most important national discs, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only national incoming trends, capable of sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are fashionable, but nobody has asked whether or not willingly this label.
The whole reacted as must react: set a new drive, and even better.
The newly launched disk entitled cannot walk fly instead can open new paths for them, although the very title intends to establish continuity with the initial years old city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It is the reference about him, on the flight, but also how best to music, now appeared - in the spirit and the tendency of the time - the guitarra that sounds more strong, the effect of rock and roll.
With these disk songs presented in the Millenáris, the singer György Ligeti now working in England with all the puzzle.
In the disk includes a real success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that recently transmitted the manana night popular music. This station led to the ears of the radioyentes music high flight from wings of love, with six engraved Hungarian singers ($ivas underground .
In order for everything is (?).
hvg.hu Balázs Zságer asked.
hvg.hu behind this new success: the question arises that you are interpreting, to what extent music is a devoted to select a public?
Balázs Zságer: the definition of public selected for me means little.
In my view, there are two types of caste mild music; no alternative, not mainstream and underground and pop trade, but and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, without sense and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from an inspiration sincere.
Also, the attitude of the spectators works with this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: you see any difference between the reception of your music by the public and Hungarian abroad?
B. Zs: abroad, especially the West of us, music slim has traditions larger.
There, not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years old frequent concerts, but also the old.
Pay much more attention to the changes in their midst music in the light, because the as part of the culture.
hvg.hu: what role has the public in your work?
Do you matters who they are, where and how they are the people who hear your music?
B.Zs: I am naturally well to see that attends ever more people to our concerts.
But we have never composed music to the market.
For some music not componemos goal, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather feels in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only on changes inconceivable.
Yet I grasped that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, pierdes their interest.
hvg.hu: to what extent pretendes follow the example of Yonderboi?
It works in solitary and made his career rather the West.
B.Zs: we do not accept their way, despite that sometimes try to compare our music with him.
We rather work in equipment, we trust the musical presence and leave to unfold.
It was inevitable that initially compare our work with Yonderboi music, because many of us we started our career in his group and hence we ran another way.
hvg.hu: in the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi wings of love is in the first place.
Many people listened for the first time the name of Zagar in connection with this song.
How Abriste concientemente with this style towards a broader layer?
: Not sought Zs.B. compose great successes and sell with these successes our disk.
This song is something more than this.
At the end of the agregamos disk, trying to relax after the resounding orgy of disk and the heaviest issues.
hvg.hu: how has selected singers six?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: the idea was to create a chorus Gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of the solistas of good voice of our own national musical scenario.
So created this chorus of six women - i.e., Kutzora Edina seine, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [] and Juci Németh neo - that was then termed Divas of underground.
hvg.hu: Compusiste singing exactly or girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: this song existed long ago in instrumental version, and when we have already had all the material of disk, we believe that there is still something.
The commensurate atraía crowned.
Yet I recorded that night singing later the learned girls.
Virtually all arrived at first attempt and spontaneous incredible way.
I remember, I entusiasmaba vastly then, but also the Divas naturally needed.
With my voice had not worked with as much strength.
hvg.hu: both in the concert as in the disk seems as if girls were in the background.
There is no solistas (except the brief only Judy Jay), they do not own role, chant all together and no more strongly that music, music, not only acompana their chants.
Also in the scenario rank in the Fund.
How intentionally?
B.Zs: they are basically simply by technical problems.
Instead consciously not wanted to distribute roles of solistas.
Singing is about this forget that our ego Presently, who of where it has been and where, so that, as those of US lifted discourage love.
It wanted to ensure that other mood eufórico he felt that we feel when we began this song.
hvg.hu: what dedicaste more work?
Zs.B.: in the composition musical in reality to any, instead of mixing pieces there was more difficult.
For example, the Dorian gray's dilemma that I am playing in a piano of concert or rock 'N' roll goes to the girls, where did not want to work for a long time, and then the groove gradually all began to its place as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: what is your singing preferred in the new disk?
Zs.B.: this constantly with concerts and because I have "soltado" the disk.
Now the Prophet fool, is to escape from the earth and never the same.
A treacherous corridor risks exchange billions for their inferiority complex
An unfair malversador.
So as to its former employee, Jerome Kerviel giant, the French banker Société Générale owner, the Bank also Czech trade.
He lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather than Kerviel was a major player who wanted to be compared to their colleagues and, indeed, with good capabilities.
Intuyó long ago, unlike all large banks Czechs, the crisis in the market for American mortgages.
"Has a fragile character" were left to hear of his superiors, the same that he was sent to the police.
But what emerges from the responses of Kerviel contained in the French media, as the newspaper Le Monde, is that this is a man who late last year had a gain more than 1.6 million thanks to their business.
Not only in America, Crisis
"Everything that I wanted to do was earn money for my bank" assures in their responses.
In fact, the summer, managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million.
This opportunity for the saw come at the beginning of the year.
In February began to hear some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgage offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
No Kerviel believed him and his bid correctly.
And, at the end of the year after their profits surpassed the 1.6 million.
"When I earned my first 500 million would not learned as" Kerviel admits and adds, which has not been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation declared that had distorted records in such a way that it was not his discovery.
Even came to mislead bosses, even when the Eurex began to take stock of their business.
The risk became benefit
What is feared that comes to discover?
Rather, not.
"I thought that had won 1.6 million for the Bank and from that simple fact, they would be happy."
Where took so willing to risk in this way?
In my position is gradually should work.
Went to work in Société Générale exactly in the year 2000, after studying in Lyon.
Its annual wage be handled among the 51 dollars.
Two years after it was Assistant stock Corridor and in the year 2005 became corridor of bag with an annual wage 90 dollars.
Still knew that was never going to earn as much as others.
"In my first interview in the year 2005 already observed that I looked carefully.
Owing to my training and also to my professional advancement and personal "described Kerviel researchers.
But the little time of my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title 500 million.
And this was a starting mechanism, and wanted more.
If you, you fall
This is as a "snowball" said the police.
But it says that bosses knew all this, or rather the sospechaban.
While earned "money, closed eyes."
Only then came the coup at the beginning of this year.
While in a lost billion euros.
After the weekend half of January wanted to wipe every fingerprints.
When the Monday came to work, no longer working in the Bank.
And two dias later, the Bank announced that he had lost $5 billion by his guilt.
And how they gained localizarle?
Became suspect from their holiday.
"I chose only four dias by the year.
That is not the corridor holiday is a corridor that does not want that nobody takes a look at his dossier "Kerviel ended.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of achieving 365 billion
Government ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs that the Czech Republic can get 14 billion (approximately sek 365 billion).
It is practicamente half the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels for 2007-2013.
Seven operational programs won an estimated 125 billion in the regions.
Czech firms can get around 100 billion wreaths program of enterprise and innovation.
Most of the money will go to transport, until 150 billion.
The program of transport is the greatest operational programs and represents until a percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get the Fund.
This money increases the Fund's budget for transport infrastructure state that next year will carry the number of 90,800 million kroner.
The program of enterprise and innovation should serve to entrepreneurs and businesses for the provision of resources in innovation of business.
Companies should funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for implementation of organisational methods more effective.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least members are recien order.
Twenty years penalty for the president of Nicaragua, passed the Court
The court of appeals of Nicaragua passed tomorrow worth 20 years for the president of the country which, arnoldo alemán, which was doomed in 2003 by the desfalco $100 billion (almost 800 million kroner).
Despite this, following a time, was released from prison to move to finance arrest in its not far metrópili Nicaragua.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the PA agency, then Central American head of state between 1197 and 2002, will be behind bars.
According to the President of the court of appeals, Ileana Pérez depend rather prison agents German leave if its punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court demonstrated as constantly traspasaba German government money account of a firm in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and account belonged, in reality, their families and cercanosT supporters.
Part of this money ended in the German fund that created to finance its campaign in the election of 2001.
So we approved the budget
This is.
The state budget was approved.
Why is special this budget?
Is the first produced by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because they set the minister Sobotka ČSSD and could not be allowed the not follow.
Aside from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing happened dramatic.
The Parliamentary Assembly, traditional in this view, although the most influential calmly approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government starts and ends with each chapter and budget line, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but he hides the power rivalry between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and so comunicacón spend a special attention.
Discussions policies are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The budgets of the state of the past governments of the Social Democrats suffered three defects that for this year 2008 is not possible to resolve so facilmente:
The first is the high turnout of mandatory laws, called as expenditure of the leaders who are not only pensions, but also the social benefits that already last year were adopted before the election by the silent coalition of ČSSD KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a consequence of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, as the budget deficit and local community.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the state's budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, lies in the budget deficit municipal and community.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money taxes, charges and creditor banks, often issued, without sense, obligations with which to their local borrowed disproportionately.
In recent years, managed to pay these debts through mass sale of energy actions and other networks of development that received the state and privatization.
Currently do not have this resource.
If we keep only official and verifiable facts, we discover that:
Our economy, because a few years ago, passing through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which boasts ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government order to halt state finances.
However, instead of the state continued to borrow.
The rest of, except for some members as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economizaron much more reasonably that our Republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
Belong to nations that within the global measures are less threatened by poverty.
Why are not necessary social massive programs that, unfortunately, in recent years are hincharon inutilmente with measures gigantic.
Although they gained eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist approved spending this year before the election, whether in brief does not change the retirement age and pension reform then really will be the end of any policy in this country which governs who governs, and will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little can say that politicians be transformed into government officials, repartidores mechanical of most of the money for retirement taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but cannot stop the pressure of normal expenditures expenditure proxy.
The deficit planned over 70 billion to 2008 would have been entirely unnecessary if the government past had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
Politicians who want not only in government officials from must therefore be patients and giving this weak coalition government realize that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and charges, quiet for the preparation of other reforms laws.
This will only gradual achievement of a balanced budget for the state.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks Swiss British, and Canadian decided to fight together against the market crisis of finance.
In the monetary marked will be more than a hundred billion by means of licitaciónes.
In these tenders auctioned off banks interest rates, for whom are capable of providing money.
For example, the American Fed sent to bid 40 billion, and after the other 24 billion will Europe's central banks Swiss and.
After the September 11 attacks, is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this process coordinated to protect and reduce the consequences of the crisis of finance.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e., the contínuo growth shortage of free capital that banks could provide" wrote in his report to customers, Bernard Baumohl consultancy economic outlook group.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably diminished the recession in the United States of a 65% to a 50 percent" added Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already spent 60 billion in outstanding credit, especially in the United States.
Economists ahead billions in losses.
"Central banks should really be fear what I expected still when decided to take this step," said the chief economist, Kieran ABN Amro Davies.
"It seems that the situation is truly evil" added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send to the American economy into recession with different impact on growth in the world economóa.
Central banks so decided, after not managed to reduce the so-called flat Libor flat, London interbancaria used for the loan of money in the market interbank.
This means that they feared banks constantly given money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain reduced during the autumn their interest rates several times.
"Will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said the Agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio Tempus consulting the company.
Some economists are not surprised at the step taken by central banks will contribute to inflame the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem is that the demise of the property market in the US.
Klaus: debates of environmentalists are staggering
The global climate change particularly affects the developing members.
President Václav Klaus expressed again with regard to the problem of global warming.
The critical emerged now with the closure of the UN International Conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where presented his book Azúl green planet, not commented, which debates of environmentalists are impossible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between rhetoric used and reality.

The Czech President during the presentation of his book emphasized that this issue is very important for him, and this is why interest.
Also expressed his delight by discover his book translated into German because as said "many times only I encounter with a caricature of my ideas."
Now the interested can informed about their varied views.
Klaus reminded that it is not a climatólogo but that is, according to his opinion, enough supposed to write a book as this.
Academic is able to follow and judge a specialist lecture, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the time of the closure expressed thought that the climate constantly and that its changes are normally, than about global warming, there is an agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence the development of climate are useless, ineffective and costosamente unacceptable.
Moreover, as men experimented with the totalitarianism regarded as unproven views unacceptable to impose on others, which feels like a dangerous to limit the freedom of others.
The questions of the present explained repeatedly that is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment, but against the militants ecologists they do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
The same subject spoke Klaus in Vienna two months ago in the Institute Hayek.

Polívka lost the realm of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost out on the mark of Walachei Kingdom.
According to the Court's jueza provincial of Ostrava was the first used the realm of Walachei but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor worked.
Polívka today was presented in sight oral.
According to his lawyer the cause probably not have finished and client recourse.
"The row consists in Mr Harabiš and his team are so many parasites popularity of Bolek Polívka" said after the process of Polívka lawyer.
For him, before the words realm of Walachei, around the world has been the image of actor and comical.
The same idea has also Harabiš.
"We are behind us some ten years of work.
Pursuit of money and invention of activities, "said.
For him, the cause of row is in the money.
"After years I realized that the project is successful, and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites our work "added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court marks the realm of Walachei was used in its first by Polívka television programme.
In 1993 was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it was not on the creation of a reorientation fictitious Kingdom.
Some years after it happened to Harabiš editing the realm of Walachei passport.
From that comical origin was a business and a lucrative business activity which Harabiš created after the realm of Walachei society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed in the use of its name and signing in passports and even offered to their discount the vistantes holders of their farms and assistants to their shows.
Who sit in the throne?
The jueza today also found that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka issued in the stage for their own benefit of business.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Walachei" said the jueza.
Added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team which pursued this completely.
The cooperation between the parties, now descompuestas continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš Polívka organized for the coronation Vsetín official.
Since then began to see conflict between Polívka Harabiš and whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav R, the elected forever."
The main role in the realm, through Harabiš resulted in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as Queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented a charge against Harabiš and their society that until now has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament by the throne with their princesses, that is already preparing Harabiš.
It should get the new king.
Did not reveal even more data and dates.
"We have no hurry.
It should be something like the King's path towards Moravia.
The King would have to be elected in a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka "may be added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi overcome prejudices:
Frankly I have never liked too the Peugeotu 206.
Their characteristics of March were never anything particular, the quality of the manoeuvre changes, and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now exists in the market his successor, Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, because I can only pensármelo better.
When the classic probé Peugeot 207 five doors, I complaining, for example, the area of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only because of complaint bodywork combi means in this sense, I will not suffer from the two meters length.
Poland by the World
Step by the interior very quickly not to repeat it too.
It is an elegant design, where the only flaw is the central tunnel poor.
Give serious consideration here more the invention of design, although the car already seems quite elegant.
Seats are comfortable, there are times in which we quejábamos short of seats and supports.
Unlike the model also 206 lateral leadership has improved considerably.
And space?, and this is how can feel have grown bodywork measures.
In the combi disappears the cited shortage of space on the head.
The boot suitcases
But the main in this vehicle is its boot.
This must appraisal as highly accessible (thanks to portón backyard flexible so that it can fold) and a storage well distributed.
The dead spaces estan Goma equipped with money that constitute an ideal solution.
The trouble, and can not extend to the point secured objects heavy.
But US stand in store.
According to the tables in basic regime, has a capacity for 428 litres what in comparison with competition is rather an average.
But not in comparison with the vehicle for the same type more sold in the Czech Republic, the škoda combi Fabia.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav model, found that the Peugeot lags behind in their perceptible 52 litres.
Holiday abroad or in placing the child's buggy its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive I quote the floor is quite background after reduce supports the line II.
In four marches 120 horses
Our testado car was equipped with a encedido injection of four about a valves capacity L. 1.6 and a force of 88 kW.
Frankly, and this is how should look like a 1600 that menospreciara family the five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has thrust.
If I compare with the days of škoda then that seemed as if the escape lifeline were taponado by an attack, I can say that with this can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of car is not for all the pockets.
However, we must bear in mind that we have testado a vehicle gracefully equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of car with ignited injection of 1400 by 329,900 wreaths, it may still be.
Our aggregates since 410,900 wreaths put it, which is already too.
The kind premium testado 80,000 wreaths already reached other.
Only that tendriamos airbag headwaters, still in the air conditioning squeegee automatic, automatic, Windows traseras automated...
That is, the car with all around, costs 531,900 wreaths.
It is much, but commands supplements in Fabia equipment and come to a fairly similar.
Now it is only to decide which of the two highs.
Students Slovaks are not integrated in English schools
In English schools children attend members from Eastern Europe and therefore, local inhabitants fear more changes in schools.
The integration of East Europeans for now only brings a series of problems.
Even British schools register cases where conflicts among immigrants and indigenous children from the increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children in Eastern Europe in British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where are starting to grow conflicts between the natives and migrants Slovaks.
Discussions, estorsión and broncas between students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has gone as far as Chatmam police arrested a woman Slovak that was hitting sticks to a student of ten years with a Green bar.
In its defence said that she was right to his son with insults tone racist.
The police had to act also after an attack on two girls age against a Slovak emigrant.
Girls agasajaron him with insults racist and jettisoned deeply stones.

When he said that what we did the shrug off of heaping apples and pears, and then fell blue and we showed its backyard described another unpleasant incident "to the times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the conflict with indigenous even designated migrants from Eastern Europe as of struggle for survival.
The cases aforementioned already show us as the environment in English schools awfully tense.
In Britain is registered 70 Slovaks came here by Labour motives.
An estimated 30,000 students Slovaks attend English schools.

For the vistantes is really the island of freedom.
Anything that expect their holiday is it possible to meet, whenever eliga correctly.

Columbus called it, the more beautiful that human eye has seen.
Havana became grocery and port of burden of that Spaniards extrajeron treasures of America and led to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National hotel grew at the end of the 20 years.
They sent to build one of the leaders of the mafia Americana lucky Luciano, because everything that had of crime in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Between their guests, among others were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana arose buildings were high, by big avenues cars that were a symbol of religion in 50 years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway is bought a finance in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had its yacht.
In the walls of East Bodeguita left their firms stars of the world of arts and politicians of all the Americas.
And now?
In the walls of Bodeguita habanense you can leave also his autograph.
In the bar of expensive national hotel compound the cocktail according to their wishes.
These cars and already cult of the 1950s, until today are still running for Havana Lada and fiat, because those who have long ago oxidado between these wetlands and salty winds.
Even when Havana, especially the district old goes deteriorates sharply, does not exist in the vicinity many wonderful colonial monuments and beyond.
Elsewhere metamorfosean in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings both necessary money, its development this guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years grew new not only in Havana hotels, but also in Varadero on the coast of the province of Holguín and islets as Cayo bogeyman, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curious that is unique in the world, and that is highly valued by lovers of railways.
It is transported sugar cane since the vast plantations until sugar factories by vias close in steam engines or electricity.
Their garages for dozens of years cannot be found and are now there, machines that work and whose models brothers in other parts of the world only in museums.
Where go?
The more known to most vistantes will not change.
And it is not therefore necessary to speak more Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, only to remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway finance is a museum for those who are lovers writer, must not stop see him.
The valley of Viñales is the most scenic corner of Cuba in the West of the island.
Exuberant vegetation bred in land chalk rock.
Mogotes, pilones chalk rock and rocks of high escarpados caidas in the valley, and in their grutas fertile land is aclimatan thanks to which are formed roquedales that hiding dense vegetation.
The Valley is the place where cultivates, probably, smoking higher quality in Cuba.
Any visitors factories habaneras of pure could meet its end product.
Perhaps someone will appear to be interesting tarmac beyond the Chilean part of the number, the largest Zeman.
Trinity
Old pedigree city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonizaran the island.
Slavery and sugar the brought fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the construction in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the settlers French arrivals later, in four centuries barely has changed.
Trinity, between the sea and Sierra of Escambray, is a place as (which still in 50 years of the last century was not the road to join with the rest of the country which.
Such isolation the helped to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new built and therefore, nor, nothing is destroyed, for each person was happy to have where live.
If you have more time in Trinidad that a single sooner, worth know places interesting close in the vicinity as Beach Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of music, which encourages with their music the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
Small town in the West of extreme Cuba, some see as the most beautiful island.
Surely this view is already confirmed by the own way.
The two roads that come back from Guantánamo must endure and quebradas high mountains, how by a barely known action nature of man.
This place Eastern Cuba has been enshrined as heritage by UNESCO intact thanks to their nature.
There are the best chocolate, in his Church have Columbus cross (it is actually a cross which came 100 years later the landing) and from the hill, where it was the house and that there is now a hotel with his name, can be seen mountains, including the best known, the anvil.

However, as we are told, better at once.

A foolhardy exit that accumulated records, owing to its duration of his departure from the modules livable, the speed with which has been posited, chapuceados instruments for astronauts for repair.
The problem appeared Tuesday then that astronauts had liberated from the shuttle discovery module harmony, one piece gruesa cilíndrica welcome soon laboratories leading scientists and Japanese (see encuadrado).
This is a kind of andén module landing for the modules - laboratories.
But it must be proveerlos in electricity.
The second task of the crew was displace a drawer of electricity production with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, to put it in its final position.
After having displaced, the crew began reorganization of solar panels of module that have a scale of 76 metres.
And it is where one of the panels, they deploy as acordeones, has been damaged in little more or less of a metre by a cable that atrancó.
The deployment has been stopped not to harm the panel more.
Astronauts, which had initially made a way out of control of the shuttle discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was flawed, were forced to engage the panel damaged.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been elected to go to caracolear at the end of the 30 metres length of guided arm of the shuttle added to the station to make repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker space" (andador NASA).

Having scoured precisely the damage, seccionó falible cable and instaló types of "tablillas" in the area damaged.
He had helped the second "spacewalker" that had been esclusa near the air, and of the Interior, by other astronauts as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool used, a hockey minibastón wrapped with aislador to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundreds of volt electric cable, has been designed and "chapuceado" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once finished operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel is completely displayed before making the list of their instruments and return within the station.
Yesterday evening, were digging astronauts benefit of a rest day before today, seven astronauts return of discovery shuttle for the return to the Land planning on Wednesday.

The choice of the status quo
No surprise Sunday, out of the ballot box: the Russians are massively to opt for the Party of President Poutine United Russia.
Confirming their quest for stability, even to authoritarianism, after a campaign very limited.
Three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin are now heading voters a message televisado on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does as leader of the list for United Russia, the Party's pro-Kremlin whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, President left no nothing transparentarse receiving ambassadors foreigners, cannot confine ourselves to deliver a new charge against the West accused of foreign - its issue of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and want basis elections, more transparent and more open, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Denunciation a campaign tarnished by pressures.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is no "never had elections as dirty, even at the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of demonstrations of last weekend, the former world champion Garry Kasparov thwarted, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are banned visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians, observed the mindset of Homo sovieticus"
Behind these legislative elections without surprise between two questions much more open:
Who will happen to Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates have until the 23 December to become known.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek the third consecutive mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will play Poutine after March?
What Prime Minister?
Does the head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that elegería the government and President?
Whatever, legislative elections as presidential elections, the outgoing power will stand.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians, observed the mindset of Homo sovieticus, not feel masters of their destiny," considers the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Centre Levada independent.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov state of the University of St. Petersburg, harks back further: civil society in this country cristianizado atrasó five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After liberal reforms in the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a state paternalist, fully accepted by the population because this new paternalism, has not been followed by terrorism, but by a true economic desahogo", estimated Maria Lipman, Carnegie foundation.
Today, the Russians "own willingness to resign for personal responsibility" of those who had given briefly test after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon is all classes, including the world affairs.
And administrative elite to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) direct local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often sinónimas of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The prefers to stability.
In the name of the Russians do not vote nor by the extremists.
Conclusion Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a professor of age of 54 years: "Why reflect?
Those who are to power are not too bad, why replace? "

Climatic propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is merciless persecution both skeptics of their forecasts as to which they gain from other social and political battles, is obliged to show an iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is the Chairman of government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than the Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet."
This approach requires explain why the action, or inaction, his government have contributed decisively to Spain to chair the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the failure to sectors, in what has been produced and why his government, the contract with the planet, it has not prevented.
Moreover, it requires explain with clear to the Spanish what measures it will take to halt climate change.
What businesses are affected, what habits citizens must be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what will economic consequences.
So, who sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But nor will there has not been such explanations.
Precisely because it is sacrificed and paying.
Measures against climate change, the real actions, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the penny of petrol suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that has been keen to deny it.
So, it comes to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with slogans devoid of any real consequence.
With phrases impactantes, committees, committees, protocols, new jobs.
With contracts with the planet, that Mr as helpful to electoral campaigns that neither speaks nor denunciation nor demands, but adorns the rallies tenderness and inspires.
Always restricted to be a virtual merely party and not intended to move in US bicycle or let us with the range.

What I insurance?
The car insurance, which covers the driver to possible sinister, represents a major expenditure that depend on various factors, such as the age, sex, the age of the card civil, the state, the kind of vehicle to ensure or the use of this, among others.
Have the car is only the beginning.
And it is that, choose the proper car insurance is even more difficult to choose the model of vehicle.
We must first be clear what we are talking about.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This compromise materialize in a contract of insurance, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed to change that will be responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which sets considering various factors, such as the age, sex, the age of the card civil, the state, the kind of vehicle to ensure that it or the use of this, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices in terms of statistics, so to greater likelihood of an accident, larger share to pay.
It is for this reason that both the elderly 25 as women have to pay premiums lower, because statistics reflect that have a lower rate of accidents due to its prudence.
Similarly, scraping the memoirs, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents that single drivers.
The use of vehicle him to influence the frequency, and thus in the chances of some kind of unfortunate experience.
The increasing frequency increase the chances.
The variables that are many insurers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
This is why, that the driver has studying well to choose the car insurance that best suits their profile.
Here the most significant variables will to choose one or another kind of insurance, for that, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offered a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 years are with various disadvantages when recruiting a certain at affordable prices, as are the reduced experience in leadership and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well secured is a livelihood insurance, there are other options more economic.
More cautious drivers may opt for a whole risk with franchise, so that they can get the insurance coverage of all but a price risk more feasible.
This kind of Convention would mean that the customer a part of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of sinister provides the customer is preestablecerá in terms of the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, head in Spain of first Europe, insurance mediator online.
Another option is a certain to third expanded, so that the customer protection against certain damage to third, although not before the caused in their own car.
Moreover, would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of vehicle.
A Council.
If you are less than 25 years trying to be careful and avoid the sinister insofar as possible, because this affect the payment, reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A reduction is a bonus tariff on the basis of the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this charge basis.
"The bonuses and penalizing will depend on the company and the benefit of this.
If the company has had a good year can afford to raise the bonuses, "lightens Noguera.
The past 25 years drivers have it easier to hire a safe, because the fatality Index falls thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is a more advisable employ all risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the previously acquired experience to help in an accident, and even in the conduct" in Spain, assures the director of the European company, which adds that most accidents occur in the second year of conduct, once the past fear of novice'.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children preferable to negotiate a livelihood insurance, provided their economic situation permitting, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with lower rate of accidents, so the recargos will be lower.
In this case, the best certain would be one to all risk with franchise (could be 300 euros), or, when it with a high level of bonus, one third extended to the third year of life of the vehicle.
"To conduct a more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power to afford to take a number of franchise greater," Luis Noguera sentence.
For pensioners is advisable to all risk insurance with franchise (remain this 150 euros), or one third expanded when you have a high level of payment.
We must say that the car insurance is important, not only because covers the driver to possible sinister, but also because it is a major spending, which is why it is essential to study properly insurance that more suits US according to our personal situation.

New fears about the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The dispute growing by the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
The majority of gas exported for Russia to the European Union is directed through Ukraine, so that each roce between both countries is a source of attention.
Kiev Moscow has warned that if the gas price increases, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute before last year cut supplies to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money to pay for Ukraine by the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that will become more to Ukraine, because it is committed to pay a extra 50% in 2008 of gas that comes from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that could be that Ukraine pay 40% more by Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important for the gas tránsitos during the talks," said the Ukrainian economy minister Anatoly Kinakh to Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about levels of rates of [transit route to Western Europe] Ukraine."
The last major of gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut through the supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a decline in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supply of the EU.
Russia has the largest gas reserves of the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies of Turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries of Central Asia.

Supporters of al-Qaeda have mounted a campaign against local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell eight militants formed by foreign residents planned an attack on an oil installation in the province of this, the report noted television.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000 effective force to protect Abqaiq facilities, the world's largest oil plant, after an attack failed of al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a declaration of Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "expert in launching of missiles," which has entered the country.

Climate of Venus can provide an idea of the future of the Earth
It could have been Venus once a place appropriate to life, declared scientists yesterday.
The data of a European space Spaceship into orbit showed the planet more like a land twin than had previously observed.
Venus is closer to the planet Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy orbits similar, although Venus is slightly more closely to the sun.
Millions of years ago Venus could have been conditions similar to those who made a habitable planet Earth, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide, and the greenhouse effect, the erosion atmospheric by Solar radiation and solar rotation slower sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today, the world has no water, the surface temperature of is sufficient to melt lead and is eroded by winds huracanados and storms of rays.
The results of the European Space Agency to express Venus, who has studied the planet by a year, offers a picture of how the land could develop catastrophic changes to cause climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, physical Department at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus express, declared: "It is clear why the climate in Venus is so different from the land, when they are two planets as similar.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as land, possibly with a environment hospitable millions of years ago."

Even remains open
Mitt Romney says that it is not worth presidential candidates to answer questions of a monkey Snow.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidates for the presidency eventually reallocation to maintain a debate in Youtube, in which ordinary voters engraved in video questions and send to its diffusion between candidates.
None of the questions put forward in the late on Wednesday 28 November were more foolish monkey that Snow asked about that Democrats of global warming in the debate the Republican Party of Youtube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican Party in the face of elections next year.
No one knows exactly how CNN producers, which co-sponsors the debate, chose the videos of Youtube to show the candidate aspirants.
But the first half an hour of debate, the longer devoted to a single issue, focusing on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful themes for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters that caused dial listen when they agradaran ideas: issuers notaron approval peaks when candidates spoke with arguments extremists.
Exchanges of words harsher night occurred between Rudy Giuliani pioneer, national, and Mr Romney frontrunner, which has been crucial in the polls Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to ruining the reputation Romney soft because it was with illegal immigration as mayor of New York.
Mr Romney attacked, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts recruiting illegal immigrants to work in their home.
Both responded aggressively when I asked whether some candidate could support a "amnesty" (allowing illegal dandoles regularize their situation and the possibility of gaining citizenship).
The minor candidates as Duncan hunter, a congressman Californian, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, managed to deal with the issue.
Neither has the word be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both blew the whistle on the immigration issue before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This cliché, along the fear of toys toxic of China and other concerns about abroad, it helps to forget the Republicans, or minimize, divisions between the liberals and conservatives Christians.
But the debate was transformed into uncomfortable appeared when other issues.
To Mr Guiliani asked why had supported arms control, in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney debated about whether the immersion in water should be considered a torture.
A person asked if candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr Giuliani to cause towards the position that while the Bible was his book runner, did not believe literally in the history of Jonás and shale.
Another person asked whether Jesus support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in the most recent survey of Iowa, thanks to his Christian conservatism longstanding - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When it was pushed respond if Jesus would be for the rió Jesus, saying that it was too smart as to be candidate in elections.
The race unusually remains open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa Coincidentally, with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and its heated debate on Wednesday's statements.
These two emerged from the Fund, because the two sides of party reached agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and forcefully with a message winner about the nobility of America, to satisfy both sides of party.
This time the party is divided, and the result is far from clear.
Labour Pains
Gordon Brown has found another hole in which sink; but equally emerges
As the political scandals remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It does not seem to have been sold influences, nor is it exhorbitantes auditors hotel in Paris, or chupadas of fingers extramaritales.
But it has shown that a rich man of business has disguised contributions to the Party of Labour government English, more than 650,000 sterling (1.3 billion), for nearly four years using names false, and that the party did not denounced.
Two months ago, when Prime Minister avoided call an election, insult car British intelligence declaring that opinion polls had not in its decision, the hope was that would provide a strong government and efficient.
But instead, as Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat heads with growing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr Brown has evolved from a Stalin to be Mr Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated the weakness regulatory and poverty trial in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has brought business groups, together, against the government.
Fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data revealing administrative botched unimaginable.
A trio of retired generals began a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against the courts in military spending: be ministers of the armed forces is called for, a part-time employment.
They are now the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt Labour, the Secretary General previous (and complicit) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown irrevocably move towards the departure.
Governments can reach a turning point after that are unable to govern.
People do not believe as politicians, but usually suspend its disbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve matters, which does not take a long time, this suspension is more: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are; the press seeks to bad news; and the government puts the defensive and not focuses.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, unlike other political leaders cannot be defended by arguing that is new.
Although I disowning Tony Blair, was his lieutenant superior.
The problems of Northern Rock and registration tax authority, are linked to decisions made as Chancellor Brown's funds.
And even when it is not directly wrapped in setbacks of Blairish - or "for" effective partners, research funding of political parties - voters may assume that if it is.
However, the situation of Mr Brown is not as bad as it sounds.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr Bean, nobody is dead, nor has it been cheated directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is giving what trends, of course Stalinistas Mr Brown's government has pledged always: a reliable and brutal.
The new political scandal donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, comparing their donations with gifts of charity, says that it wants to public recognition by its benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision decision him.
Laws against anonymity for large political taxpayers is clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
Mr. Watt, said that they know that the agreement of Mr Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, chief of raising funds to which they asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown until now is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of payments was done after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half of work.
Has been quick to condemn his party by violate the law, but it wither in decision - making by a family affair, a commission of research on the matter - conducted largely by a judge, and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, is a matter of the police.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, as Chief find a permanent and independent for the Commission of standards in public life, as it has been one from six months ago, and it must also pressing for a genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require a hard work cooperative of Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation has with unions - contested measures to a partisan as Mr Brown.
But he must confront some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way that can persuade victory is to act with a neat probity and a strong competition.
Sharks Cards
The crisis of mortgages subprime is infecting the American market of credit cards?
When there are blood on water, it is only natural that a fins dorsales naden emocionadas around.
Now that the American market of housing is in crisis, predators have their eyes in the country's market of credit cards.
In Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that losses in credit cards can reach the 99 billion if mortgages subprime crisis or other forms of Consumer credit.
There are already signs of contagion.
There is an increase in both the charges of cards as crime rates, measuring the proportion of the balances that have not been covered or that are more than 30 days of backwardness, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that has taken 1.4 million office in their business financing American consumer, partly because of the weakness of borrowers of credit cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
Late and crime are low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter of 3.89% crime rate was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of people (2005) gave rise to a sharp decline in the applications of bankruptcy, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and hence of gloom) would be growing again, or it can happen that conditions for lenders were getting worse.
The industry also reported solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts pay consumers each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset - backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other areas.
Dennis Moroney TowerGroup of research, a firm, predicted that the volumes of emissions by the year 2007 will be nearly 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection of the crisis between mortgages subprime and the market of credit cards certainly exist: consumers like to carry the debts credit cards now that the credit institutions are ending.
But the emitters of credit card look more the flow of liquidity that values assets, so falling prices accionan not necessarily a change in the ability claim of borrowers.
Can even work for aventajar to issuers.
The incentives for consumers continue to have the mortgage declines if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, debt repayment of the card rises in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or upsetting balances creditors.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid retasación assets.
"We will not arouse a day and assess new all loans," says Gary Perlin, chief of capital finance one.
If the subprime sudden infection in the market of credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a steady decline are far more realistic.
If prices are lower houses and a credit crunch drive America to the recession, industry undoubtedly faces a future more severe.
We must continue to monitor these fins dorsales.
British bankers convicted in Enron case
Three British bankers were to trial for their responsibility in fraud in the former head of the financial Bureau of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.

The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling commissioned guilty the last years for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a condemnation of more than 24 years.
The condemnation of lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when died of a heart attack last year.

Britain takes with the demands of trial and Ravi Bopara Owais Shah
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should strike at no 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important compared to the first test against Sri Lanka, who must take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, President of the selection is on loan - with that title particular at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the manager, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill out to become dials national, and if not, in one part time.
The not succeed in the sixth of breaks will be unfortunate, but life is often unjust and sport, too.
It is not easy to throw what makes a man at the top of their profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, because they require trials that always end up being subjective.
Is the time just to Bopara feet?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be done in another aspect if John Edwards, says "or" Tubby Banerjee, two bright young executives with good degrees and that are familiar with the business, had to be promoted board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless given the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Naturally figures have a great influence in decisions, but it also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the eye of Captain at the same time taking a wicket bateador to secure and an opportunity to change the order if it wants to have an impact as a player one day.
But capture the eye of the seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison pleads for fit and bowls like wind networks.
Anderson took wickets 32 first class in 33 careers for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more of them.
The Shah or Bopara games in the stadium of Asgiriya may be only a matter of opinion.
The choice may break the race or make a man, or can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did so well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite pencil a cent double against Australia in Australia, may yet be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney Vaughan Moores, and, after a discussion more in today's sitting in the stadium, will continue its instincts Asgiriya conservation and promote the greatest experience of Shah above the exuberance of young Bopara.
There is a case for both sides.
For Shah is your brilliant and valuable proof debut of the early in Bombay 88, 32 hundreds of first class against only Bopara 6, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten careers in both its shift in may against the West Indian in the test in lords, his home as Middlesex player, and that caused a rejection of the immediate selectores Vaughan when requisitioned its place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken its batting élan something that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has joie de vivre on swords.
He prende for nothing in the field of cricket and its attitude was summarised as when turned their exposure to the vehicle in a car sponsor of England, Volkswagen.
Suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing that did get their Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his fellow team that scorned from afar, to say with excitement: "dresses that?".
Is the best Bopara player is, including its slippery happens to have effects on their flanked by, for that seem satisfacerlo batea with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choose the best moment, another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
My inclination would give Bopara its opportunity, which does not mean that the Shah successful, as suggest the leaves of tea, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Refugees buses bring back to work - and the fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees of Syria began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who stayed without effective, without extensions of visa and hoped that the city return to normalcy.
Some even had returned to fight the militants that led out of their homes.
In the station of Mansour buses, even before the advent of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of government composed of a dozen buses, terminal was full of refugees Syria and Jordan had grown in private transport.
"Decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I returned today by what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that is certain now."
"Say that the Mahdi Army left to kill people," declares, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered their troops a desired domestic ceasefire.
The Shiite, Qassim Atwani 38 years and professor Sunni in the area of Amariyah, returned to his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria for the regime does not want to Iraqis working in their country.
Its neighbors Shiites in which they Amariyah telephone to say that a US ally helped to bring Al-Qaeda outside their bastion the West of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers of Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been taken from his home in Sleikh North of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after which called for citizens to stand up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends and I called told me that had begun a militia anti al-Qaeda and that they needed in Sleikh my support and my fellow."
"I therefore again today," declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said to be swayed by the calm growing in the capital since US troops afianzaran groups of "citizens concerned," armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many have declared by the visa ban and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government imposing visa restrictions of refugees to compel people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country for sectarian cuadrillas cause of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni Muslims.
"I do not believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my home after that I left."
Part of the reason for cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from the Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees does emerge again sectarian tensions and start the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even is conspicuous by the international orientation of their superior schools.
As in the entire country, the sarlandeses only a lack of education.
"Yesterday explained by a quincuagésima not sarlandés that we are not franseses" - that was the bike ironic about themselves of smaller federal state for its cencuentenario.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a large role in the educational system of Sarre that in a study of the Institute of the German economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, by tradition superior schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken melted was in 1948 by franseses.
Until now students can end here his career universities with two or three dipolmas.
By a consequence, the percentage of nickel of foreign students is high, 15, 6 by hundreds.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in schools superior. Many of them have no bacillerato.
"In the Sarre it seizes the system of vocational education," says Axel Plünnecke, the experte of education sector in the Institute of the German economy (IW).
More than five young people in school baccalaureate makes his professional. So it is that the Sarre is 7 points percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for an academic - vocational education is very wide.
The offer of careers double, relative to the number of people, it is the second best in Germany.
Despite vocational training and a growing demand, the number of engineering graduates in science fell by a third in recent years.
This was the reason why the Ministry of education of Sarre forced schools superior to do more to advertise sciences specialities engineering.
After the first "PISA study conducted, reforms in schools of General education," says a spokesman of the Ministry of education.
So the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For children begin as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "Kita - hope," he has no cost. Meanwhile, this model imitate also other estades federal.
The comparison with the next studies show if has increased students' performance.
According to the report PISA of 2003, the number of pupils behind in development desminuyó school of 29 at 20%.
But, in general, the Sarre not improved much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, pupils calculate know better.
To the chagrin of the sarlandeses, the report PISA does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, though in this field could achieve good results.
Despite sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in secondary education Institutes.

Venus: twin brother Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suited to life, Venus is the planet more akin to the land, something that has so far been raised. The European probe "Venus express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolinos in the Poles, the same winter also appear on earth.
Since three decades ago researchers had the suspicion that may be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves on the verge of the atmosphere. In Venus cayen rays of heights of 54 miles from a cloud behind other Russell Cris account of the University of California in Los Angeles to scientific magazine "nature."
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller rays, caused life on earth: storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for its part, had given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus is not so: if there had some day life, this would have to be in one of the first states of evolution, "explains are Solomon of the institution Carnegie Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus cannot be life: the pressure atmospheric is almost 100 times higher than in the land and on the surface temperatures reign 500 th oscillating C, so that they can be achieved freezing temperatures.
"Possibly, Venus twin is a" diabolical "of the land, but remains a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus express" is to respond to the question why Venus, so similar to the land by its mass and size, has had a evolution so different.
As since the 1990s was not special missions, only to research of this planet, the launch of "Venus - express" in November 2005 was a very important step for research from Venus.
The final results of research that will be presented in many stories of "nature," according to emphasize researchers, not just the unity of Venus in the solar system.
This desmuestra "also planets neighbours are more common characteristics with the land of course," we reports that.
Despite the familiar winds tempestuosos in the North Pole, researchers found in the South polar region also a vórtice formed by the clouds that tour faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high ground atmospheric layers of Poles, according to describes a research team Giuseppe Piccioni Italian Institute of special Astrofísica physical and space.
The second world of solar system has the mass almost equal to the land and with their diameter Guinea 12 miles is almost as large.
This planet also called star ALBA or evening star orbit around the sun almost 50 days.
But his period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus amounts to 243 days on earth.
Although Venus with their surface temperatures 460 degrees and with its pressure atmospheric 92 bars is not to the land, scientists are based on the basis of both planets had formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets had aglomerado water on earth stayed in the oceans, but in Venus disoció is in the universe.
Whereas in the land carbon dioxide had become carbon stones Venus, form the bulk of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the rally of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
Kohler, the Federal President insists on the end of the fight between the parties by adopting the Dalai Lama in the federal offices.
He criticized indirectly by social-democratic party by their attacks on the German Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Kohler, the Federal president is concerned about Germany's image and therefore demanded that the grand coalition ends this fight by the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present as a divided nation," said the newspaper Koehler "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed its understanding with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Union Demócratacristiana) in September.
"Although in awe the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force for me," said Koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in meteria of foreign policy, highlights the federal President, defending Merkel by the reproach received to make a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor not taken the distance from the traditional course of the politics of a China.
China also knows, "said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the minister of foreign affairs (social-democratic party), had been indirectly its displeasure by receiving Dalai Lama and because of this was attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its policy ineffective in the external issues.
The reception of Dalai Lama offices in the federal caused great misunderstandings in Sino-German.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to peer Steinbrueck social-democratic party, the finance minister of Germany, but also information sources, according to the magazine "Spiegel," froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China's position, claiming Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians were religious leader of the Tibetans in its official position.
The actions and the words of Dalai Lama showed that is trying to divide the Tibet, and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that will be seen as the riots in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shootings, burning cars, Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that will be riots as was the case of France.
The federal minister requires that we do everything possible to social dissatisfaction in Germany is not transferred to the streets.
Became barricades, the vandals fired guns with the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the federal minister of internal affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Union Demócratacristiana) fears similar tendencies in Germany.
"We have to look at the social problems of our country does not take the form of violence."
"That we have to take seriously," said in the newspaper "Neue press", published in hanover.
Not all the young work in constant change of social reality.
The federal state, the federal state and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Schaeuble.
This is not only to the integration of immigrants.
"The summit of integration into the conference of Islam: all this is already taking its first fruits."
It is still early to assume the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the suburbs Germans do not have the same problems and sociological edificatorios as in France.
The young conducted serious riots in the streets with the police North of Paris past nights.
In Tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish community in Germany demanded federal government's efforts to integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns copycat effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
Despite all the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years is above the average.
We must ensure that there is more jobs vocational training.
Kolat underscores: "We must give a prospect of the young."
The president of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in families," greater than the country French.
Moreover, the majority of the young of foreign origin does not destroy what had built here their parents.
Kolat speaks: "But despite all, we must be careful."
There is that "providing the opportunity to young people receiving faster a job or of vocational training."
Meanwhile night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew across the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as heaps and cars burnt.
Since the day before a team of nearly 1,000 policemen is addressing security.
After a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of internal affairs, announced that the police is going to strict measures until it is necessary.
Monday evening Tuesday around 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident Sunday, which killed two young.
According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of the young was not because of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke.
Far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content came to his last point and expect no nothing more of it.
But in what country live really Chancellor?
After his heartbreaking action, indifferent and without much contained in the general debate of the lower house, we must say: it did not live in the country that would have to be governed by it.
In terms of reproach him by have devoted repeatedly in foreign policy, Chancellor presuntuosa goaded with a phrase.
He said that this would be a way truly provincial and thus showed did note that does not understand what interests critics.
In the lower house pled very clearly articulates all that reproach was right.
Nor could not be felt a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke was this: a policy very high fleeing in foreign policy and without achieving there is nothing in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: flabbergasted praised itself by decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how here these goals in matters of climate.
In general, this way of alabarse itself - from two years ago, the leader of the Party of the Union has not been able to allow Demócratocristiana so modesty.
For insists on expressions to a boost to the people.
And thereby impairs its public image by the pragmatic vision to solve the problems that go by without the trees.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke aparencias internal problems are of little value.
The poverty of children and concerns about low-wage workers?
The only is dedicated to talk about this issue using subordinated sentences.
How many times is impressive is wrong to speak when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a phrase more or less good.
Starts to face "as if he had been in uncharted territory," when it was more concrete information.
The section attacks.
The two front, and Mitt Romney Rudy Giuliani, made a confrontation in a heated debate Republican presidential precandidatos of Youtube and must now fear only one candidate from outside.
Since a principle to be felt tensions between candidates.
Mitt criticised Romney his adversary Rudy Giuliani that he had made in New York in "a site of refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, responded with serious accusations: "I say that his own house was a" port "for illegal." Giuliani replies ex-governador of Massachustes saying that he was who used to illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attacks: as until now the group of Republicans has no clear favorite, the eight presidential precandidatos exploited the debate on CNN, especially to discredit his adversaries.
The small videos 30 seconds rodados by Internet usarios that were sent to Youtube, nor have much content.
"With this way of isolation fall to Hitler coming to power," that was the accusation of John McCain his adversary Ron Paul, the only the meeting that insisted on immediately withdraw troops from Iraq.
Romney receives too much criticism by the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when refuses to acknowledge as torture Waterboarding a method of questioning, to leave a person choke simulate his death.
The public's reactions room in St. Petersberg missions in Florida show that Meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or debates about torture.
The public applauded always very strong when alababan conservativos values and denying higher taxes.
It can do better where are the weaknesses of both front.
"At the time I was right," explains Romney compungido pardon and demands to people and the public television by have been defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, it did not know what to say when asked what he thought about literal interpretation of the Bible.

Thus become the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.

The founders of Krautrock again.
The most famous German band of the 1970 their activity continues: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As reestreno became a copy of "live 1974" that was written in the heyday of the Gang.
In those days were very famous in foreign countries.
These three gentlemen's assistance to an official food caused the sense.
Each of them has in front of his cajita itself, its cable and above all their buttons.
In the East is sitting Dieter Moebius that has 63 and is dressed in a white shirt.
His left is Michael Rother 57 years, which has its portable computer and guitarra.
On the right, looking audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years of age, which is busy with the panel of controls.
Each contributes to their sounds, among them are even pace.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This does not seem to bothers Messrs..
Something very exciting to the passionate of Krautrock was the fact that the Gang Harmonia music to do.
What we must disclose here is this: the questions precisely have shown that the name of the Gang retumbaba in the minds of people, but it was not something special so as to 32 years after the public extrañase both.
But why Germans cannot also applaud his legend alive in the 1970s?
Above all because the misconceived Kautrock strong was always more in Britain and the United States in his own country.
When the entertainment industry gave a prize music "echo" to the members of the Gang can 2003 Cologne for his work of life, in the room could be shocked to see the faces of German pop artists.
And when network hot Chili Peppers agradecía gang to the Düsseldorf and Neu!, all opened up with astonishment.
He later Michael Rother time in the stage for the network concerts hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (band).
Ignorance recognition at home and abroad, are one thing.
It is a problem to remind this band, because the threesome existed only two years, and in those times achievement, not a great effect on the public, however, it was subsequently thanks to others.
A long ago Moebius Roedelius music and had done with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a cluster name, which promised much fame.
Initially tocaban in the cellar of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, worked with a firm in Duesseldorf music that was patronizada by a Church.
For a while, Rother had a trabajillo in Kraftwerk and then worked in the Gang of guitarrista Neu! managed to improve the reputation of this German band in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of cluster in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is in ruins of the sixteenth century, lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological that I, where Roedelius Comune could complain of his position.
This was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
According to say, one day appeared a cosy compact of association of Ottenstein Harmonia song in the Rubbish, which proved to be a good name for art.
There was also disadvantages in the use of Harmonia name.
The first albúm called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "Lux."
Despite the music was smooth and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as artist was not only to be known itself.
The CD "live 1974" was engraved during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording participated nearly 50 people.
Then Rother expressed its desire to power Harmonia and make once in trials.
This demand for Roedelius and Moebius is against the habits.
In 1975 band announced its separation.
Ended Rother proxy esoterismo issues and secured its existence with álbumes as "Flammende Herzen."
Cluster reviving the 1980s and from that time has been more successful than had Harmonia.
The direct recording of albúm in Griessmer, this is to thank Groenemeyer.
Their company music Grienland aim was to cultivate this contribution to preserving it as German own music alive.
As the work of Roedelius, also band Neu! was new exposed.
The presentation of Harmonia as gang takes place in the House of cultures of the world in Berlin.
The public with measures subsidized was band of Festival Wordtronics.
There is Julian cope, English, the old punk and the author of The manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There is also present Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influence of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super - Banda, since he was a vacuum.
The phrase of Brian Eno coupled with special music full room: "This is the only some music music, she would partenece the fúturo."
There are photos where appears Harmonia with producers in a holding.
The history of the development of the legend is in projections photos in black and white, where are instruments with cable.
There are three in the Fund veterans that began to improvised new.
Do nothing more than set microphones to the body and set to produce an extraordinary tones with the help of the equipment effects that had built with their own hands.
Today the electronic music is as well as had to be.
Three people who build technology.
But this does not change anything.
Under the direction of barbaric Morgenstern, in an environment is tose susurra musical, and in a good moment of emphasis was sings "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always a longer-term English.
But this was never rock.
It is not the origin of gender into the blues, but in schools music (can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Who here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia retains calm.
In the scenario is very well thinks about what is already clear.
Where it begins and where it ends music?
This may break one respiratory or giving away rapid moments of luck.
To Richard Gere solely will need more cynicism.
The two films "the hunting party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" go back to the war in the Balkans.
But both were not so much conviction.
Or the concepts focus much in stocks and tirotes or two films are demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with their "the hunting party" nor can help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark Interior during the Bosnian war, was found again the actor Richard Gere.
Finally, we lost the man more guapo view of the 1980s, because no one wanted to look after their roles and pleasant unimportant in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "the hunting party - when a hunter becomes what pursues" (why today titles of films have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to see: in the Fund, its role in the war is reporter presentation of what could make Richard Gere, if the destination and the film industry had not been so misericordiosos with him. He was a man whose better times of life already spent, as a monument to ruin of its decline maintained until now the bulk of its charm.
"The hunting party", despite this triumph, together with "Moerderischer Frieden" that is the German and production will also presented this week, seem to be only a series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
The film "can be narrar Moerderischer Frieden" in short: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbia francotiradores of Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that it takes that they are also enamore it.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we welcome the Serbs are not brought once again as the only culprits.
The film is like series German alarm collects 11 "all" without multilane, but in a state of war.
In the example of "the hunting party" can be investigate, because in reality there has never been a good film on the war in the Balkans.
In another moment, with another director and with another author of script (Richard Shepard in two charges), history on reporters Americans in the war that are to detect a Serb war criminal called Fox probably could be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are remarkably similar: the small teams are twice to mountains to carry out something that cannot do the army and increasingly is a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "the hunting party" is when at the beginning present US Simon hunt, he would not cease to be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also provides an adventure amorosa with a Muslim Bosnia to kill then.
Then the hunting party is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive quickly achieve what could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all hunters of head of the world, which was capture the war criminal and to leave Bosnians musulmanos vengaran for a fair way.
It is so badly, who want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on the crimenes against logica cinematica.
However, the lack of punitive is, in reality, one profondamente human.
The pelicula wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić esten even free, and stresses that Americans and the French are not estan genuinely concerned of persecution, owing to their political arrangements between them.
Sometimes it good and bad are so similar, so that one comes to lead a very famous poem Brecht.
In this peoma is a mask a demon Asian gandes: "in the effect of their front see, sharing the feelings with him, it is hard to be wrong."
In movies as "the hunting party" there are also these devils, but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only in the kind of films of war in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published that all the Hollywood movies produced in Iraq are fiascos.
One can also add that there has never been a good film on southern Africa.
It is almost always a rule: when a star dabble too for a region of crisis or the minefields, then something like "Rangoon have recently" with Patricia Arguette, "on the other side of all borders with Angelina Jolie" or "diamonds sangrientes" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short time.
They have to spend at least decades until a good ruede Hollywood film about the Holocaust taking as an example the film "the list of Schindler."
Because some films need more time. The classic as works on the war in Vietnam "the deer hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "full Jackett metal" in his times were not concluded by unanimity as masterpieces.
Today, perhaps know much about world conflicts, and therefore in our time every slaughter (Massenmord) comes presented directly in two televisions at home.
And this is because the authors of the lowest script have no qualms (which is necessary for power) in narrar stories good.
"To be or not to be" or "the great dictator" were ultimately so good, because Lubitsch Chaplin and still not so bad knew that was in fact the Nazi regime.
Perhaps we should not be a good man to got a film.
Perhaps there is to be as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its distant and look sarcástica an artist.
When he was asked about the parallels between their historical novel dictionary Lemprière of the war in the Balkans, replied, "this is only that some things never change their."
Large cities always will be in danger, men will always be killed cruelly and Yugoslavia always will reign war.
Von Beust receives as response negative criticism about the Olympic games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism of politics and economics by applying for the Olympic Games summer.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the section of water sports.
But Beust reminds us that we need to be realistic to estimate the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Chamber of commerce in Hamburg, stated on Wednesday this resignation as "no good for the economic location."
In the last time no other project in the city fostered motivation, much like the idea of the organization of the Olympic games.
Without this objective "could not keep the political momentum, sports at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time."
The Mayor Wednesday Ole von Beust kept their statements that Hamburg ambitions in the organization of the Summer Olympic Games were not carried out until at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but that is decided by the Federation of German Olympic sports," says von Beust in Welt online.
Referred to the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund) that is expected in early December, on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games of winter of 2028.
This preference "means for US than in this period of time, until now, we have until 2028 from the point of view, we will not have a realistic chance."
Despite all this dream did not forever, said von Beust.
The Federation of sport Hamburg (HSB) laments statements von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not seek the Olympic games.
"It is too early to deprive the opportunity, if at this moment plans are bankrupt," said the Wednesday Günter Ploß, the director of HSB.
A renunciation of the request is contrary to the declaration of the head of the Senate, which did in a reception during the general meeting of the Federation of sport German public schools superior (adh).
There von Beust appointing the application of Hamburg Universiadas for 2015 not as "a substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport schools superior Hamburg appointed as a candidate application.
The fraction of the German social-democratic party (SPD - Bürgerschaftsfraktion criticised) to the Senate that failed to take the time so valuable to building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate holding with the development of small town of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympics or building houses," claimed Carola Veit and Jan Quast, members of the German social-democratic party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning for the small Grasbrook Olympics and then the use of houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request of Hamburg to the Olympic Games in the summer of 2012 provoked a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed to cause of Leipzig.
They are not the crates of timber.
Who do the terms Sweden and box of timber, thinks in Ikea, but not think about Andy Warhol.
Or do?
Today the crates of timber produced in Sweden are like the shadow on the list of Warhol works.
Most of the 1990s and four glitz - box "type of" of this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen halt" doubts about the true glitz - boxes of 1968 of Andy Warhol, the modern museum Stockholm Museet conducted internal investigations and reached conclusions disappointing: six "glitz - boxes," that the former head of the museum Pontus Hultén into modern museum Museet, are false, and almost one of the other "type Stockholm," which are in circulation in the art market international, are too.
The dark ages is too complicated with a confused relationship between the artistic production and patrocionadas.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York its first "glitz - boxes," in the crates of timber, blue red and white, with the same shows that had cartons of dust flakes "glitz."
According to Warhol, in the exposure of their works of 1968 in the modern museum Museet were exposed hundreds of glitz - cardboard boxes. These did not Warhol (because of the expenditure), but were brought directly factory carton of "glitz."
It was not works of art, but of copies (which were only a objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed produce in Sweden a glitz - crates of timber, but were not exposed in the modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now talk about that almost fifteen crates, who at the time came in the history of art and the auction original as "glitz - boxes" from "type Stockholm" unauthorized by Andy Warhol.
At auction some of them were bought by more than 100 billion dollars.
The problem is that the famous Museum director Pontus Hultén inaccurate made in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost 100% of timber boxes Warhol that they are left to him.
But in reality, 105 crates were produced in the same year in 1990 to Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
In this time Warhol had already died since 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives in the modern museum Museet, explored six glitz - boxes museum ownership and also Three Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. Was first imprimieron esmerilaron and their platas serried and then the painted by óleo with the pincel.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990's copies shows that paint was implemented with a steam without printing directly platas serried. Moreover not paint, but the óleo paint acrílica.
These boxes "have not been approved by the artist and must be removed from the list of official glitz - boxes Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, the director of the modern museum Museet and adds that if the Commission of Autentificación "Andy Warhol rule" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the modern museum Museet clasificará these six crates as / objects copies of exposure. "
In July the Commission of Autentificación formally announced that accepts these "serious accusations" that it is crates of dust bubbles.
But since that time there all remained silent absolute.
