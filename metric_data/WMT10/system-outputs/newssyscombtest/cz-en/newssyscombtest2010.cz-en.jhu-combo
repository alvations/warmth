The US: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny, with a snaivost Barack Obama, the president with a reputation the nejchytejho, the repeated in the Afghan strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered it.
When finally vypotil his eagerly expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that her over koprk of Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
not only in the text uses the word several times turnover as in Iraq, "but did not even use the name of Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration:" new way forward ".
He was three years ago, criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq beset by civil war as "irresponsible and in the aftermath of catastrophic decision".
The subsequent months have shown, however, that the Bush strategy based on a recommendation from field commanders was the only possible and velespnou so that today in the intelligence on Iraq.
Bush's reputation, but objectively he left his successor, much default situation than can be expected.
in Afghanistan, Barack Obama in that the miracle again.
The increase in military contingent asked him again field commanders, in particular the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite subordinanm harshly criticized the practice the shooter in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men in order to break the situation for the better.
The President three months hesitated, but nothing better, and so at least the general 10 thousand soldiers.
From Europe could squeeze out the promise of further 5 thousands, even though he was initially originally with at least 10.
on the whole Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin of troops from Afghanistan for 18 months and end this process within three years. The Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the increase in fruit increase the same fruit as the in Iraq.
Despite the internecine wars of recent years is the Iraqi society is relatively well ordered, its leaders to honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - the one could not count and no agreement have not been compliance.
Wrong under these conditions, prepare the Afghan security forces used day to change the master, as it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they are formally based, will remain just potmkinovou village, which will continue to spread patriarchal tribal relations.
Balance the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to nepehlednosti ratios, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Neither the establishment of a "akceschopnho state", a minimalist objective of the operation, does not look too real.
Obama's strategy at the time horizon.
for the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated only, and is now on the verge of explosion.
To believe that soldiers into combat in order to "return home" will cause here made a miracle, can only really romantic soul, the facts.
From a political point of view, setting a date for withdrawal of troops by, because the Taliban will be seen as an implicit recognition of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing the.
European politicians can not and do not want to explain to voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically to intervene in the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions on the Iranians not, from the United States the question of whether to try to solve the problem of military force.
to reply to it, it will be just at a time when Obama's America to withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only for Barack Obama, the fact that the presidential election three years, and there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop.

The secret glow of Norway rozlutno: the Russians tested a
over Norway to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border, an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Start again but was unsuccessful and the shot known as type "Bulava", which was originally the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black nightmare Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
his presence at the tests missiles on the success of the test flights.
majority of all took nevzltla or damaged in the air.
In Russian newspaper of "writes as the" rocket that fly.
missile, which can fly but shines
This in order for the 13th experiment was initially normally.
The end of the flight was again to technical apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third stage of rocket.
This time, "bulava" startovala from nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which was below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missiles, allows the firing of rockets from the vessel, which is in motion at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by the unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Indeed, the Norwegians from the first time they had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals this time, and that we cannot speak clearly about failure.
The first two missiles, and an accident to hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines in the first instance.
If not have not one test start, for the failed leadership of the ministry of defense that only six of thirteen.
Almost 50 of success because the generals are filled with optimism and still claims that "Bulava" one day fly without problems, and that even up to ten nuclear blocks of a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.

Hyundai the unions. Cancels all overtime
Management Nosovice Hyundai car with the unions agreed to abolish all overtime.
It is because of the often announced by the unions on Monday.
It confirmed Hyundai spokesman Petr Vank.
Management, however, wants to trade union leaders to agree even on a Saturday this year's shift.
We can not resign in our production plan, it is essential, therefore, was designed to voluntary overtime Saturday, 19 December, with the result that would have made two shifts, said.

In addition, all employees Saturday shift get paid the fare and lunch.
Whereas the overtime was nejurgentnjm and from the point of view of comments and complaints, and employees of protesters, last week stopped production, so the management yesterday afternoon decided with immediate effect, the abolition of all any overtime for the month of December, he said.
Staff car companies were last week forced to virtually every day after an eight - hour shift to work overtime.

Czech discovery: a substance that works on 'hardy' HIV
A team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that it works and the viruses that have immunity against drugs.
This fact, in some cases, that the compound is a normal variant of the virus is not as strongly as some already available medicines.
AIDS can not cannot be cured.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that inhibit reproduction of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Partial suppression of propagation of the virus has resulted in the development of the so - called resistentnch viruses against which the are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences Czech republic of, from VCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus.
proved that a substance called metalokarborany acts on a protein responsible for the reproduction of HIV.
Metalokarborany are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus than all currently used drugs, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work, scientists are coming with the new improved compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
have a unique three - dimensional structure: two cages connected by atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked metal, in this case.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV proteza is a protein, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protezou fission caused by the HIV virus would not ripe infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry, Academy of Sciences.
in work published in the scientific journal Journal of the medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which they are two pairs of cages (see table) a short organic chain, which is also systematically revised.
A slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti HIV proteze was tested in vitro, and also against the sturdy (rezistentnm) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as clinically used drugs, but its effect does for resistant variants against which used drugs are often ineffective.
A unique mechanism of action and its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications of metalokarboran makes interesting compounds for further research to the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlna ezov, head of the Laboratory Structural Biology Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument for the budget. ODS has to Fischer, to prevent
of chairman Mirek Topolnek described the approved budget for next year as "awesome" and the government of Prime Minister John Fischer, he should consider the continued existence.
Expression of ODS named prime minister with strong statements.
He said that the time for analysis.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly not working.
The Prime Minister, according Nease must decide whether it intends to rely on the house of minority, which regards the fight against growing deficits, or he wants to remain in office with the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy on the issue of public deficits is fundamentally different, "said Neas.
The House on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, with the leftist amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House had raised money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
criticism of the government's proposals to address social democracy was that by increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote, left the hall, meet the wishes of the government that the revised budget is less bad than a so the solution.
disappointment and frustration
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government assess the current situation even more.
Neas is convinced that if a seriously to leaving functions in the case of the adoption of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television ordered on Monday after the government of Prime Minister.
He suggested that is considering further remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment of the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer willing to continue the fight the budget deficit, not the government what to do nominanti Social Democrats, which changes in the budget.
Prime Minister should also clearly say that he would resign if the House approves further legislation increasing the deficit, such as those relating to sick leave, pensions, or an amendment to the staff of the law.
ODS Topolnek: ministers
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the government.
Ministers have n't done anything wrong, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
He reminded that on several ministries are in nmstkovskch features people, the top 09, who voted against the budget.
. pointed out that if the Fischer decides to abandon the principle of fight with the amount of deficit, "is perfectly logical and correct that relying on left - wing majority, which is currently in the House."
Then, but can count on support from the tolerance and civil tolerance.
I had not thought about it, and when it is the current, so that you take, told reporters in the House Defense Minister Martin Bartk, was nominated by the government of the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
at the request of the prime minister stepped ODS
Neas also stressed that the ODS would seem to be in the House on Wednesday voted against the amended budget, if the prime minister of the Civil Democrats explicitly requested that the adoption of the budget.
I do not feel like orphans, we are small children, responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget netila absence of the President in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my voice was missing.
When I was giving up the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months will be bolevizaci the House and destruction of all positive, he alone.

Vaccination against will be free and optional
Vaccination against since January.
to be the first for free, and at the same time.
But there are voices, that it would be compulsory vaccination more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokm peak.
The Institute has set a maximum price of vaccines, which pay health insurance.
Experts have also have clear procedure for vaccination.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for children in August
From January may be free of charge against pneumokokm children who were born last 2 August and later.
The condition is that still did not even one dose of vaccine.
Who began last year or sooner, it must pay for himself and others.
The first dose of vaccine must be made between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against pneumokokm quarter of families.
Parents, paid 1600 crowns per dose even more.
the need for vaccination the youngest four children are needed.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies to on the vaccine dose of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
But the treatment that children without vaccination needed.
Yet for all the vaccination of children was roughly 500 thousand a year.
vaccination was introduced by the so - called janotovm package.
inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including brain and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infections in us for the year die in hospitals to 28 children under 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic by the vaccination of children against pneumokokm in in 40 countries.
The vaccination compulsory?
at the same time, but there are views that would in the future could be the vaccination compulsory.
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
It would be better to vaccination, for example, head of the civic association Unmute Rudolf Kalovsk.
his long association pneumococcal vaccine.
Experts at the international conference, which our associations participated in, they were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to push through at least this.
I think that is the way that we have to get in, said Kalovsk.
The Ministry of Health but the vaccination against change.
at the moment about at all, said his spokesman.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors
The president of practical children's doctors Hana Cabrnochov recognises that the voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, could be considered to reduce the number of "in situations where this vaccine is the high amount, quite understand the political decision that vaccination was started as a voluntary," he says Cabrnochov.
Experts expect that their infants to vaccinate against pneumokokm from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is a breakthrough and that it was the first area vaccination of children borne by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should make money on prevention, save it for further treatment, explains Cabrnochov.
Doctors will have to buy the substance
but with the practical which relate to children's doctors regarding purchasing vaccines.
According to the original intent of the vaccine to buy insurance companies and doctors would receive, as they become available substance to other vaccinations.
Some Members, however, feared that they could give insurance companies "money from the health insurance.
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substance and wait until they are insurance companies.
According to estimates, the individual child physician doctors to invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochov.
Still they and we
It may be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
at a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the building of minarets and generally spread alarm reports the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed, whether they are to integrate Muslims - and whether and integrate - into one of the continent's secular society.
Some of the readers, after reading this book became the artist's last work, "why the French do not like on the head" (2006), this elegant and a study on the issues that divide and employ the country for a period of 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
mr. bowena the last book has a broader and more ambitious scope.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now taking care of 5 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen called "Islamic areas".
It is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues, which is most worried about.
Should a Muslim enter into marriage in the mosque or at City Hall (or in both places)?
It should be taught about the development of young Muslim and gay rights?
It may be a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Muslim has the right to use interest - the banking system wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, which are discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than the political drama, which employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other - known, including Tarika Ramadana, Arab, Muslim and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate on how it can also be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have arguments for all their custom.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the actual idei French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists that Mr Bowen conducted interviews, on the belief that is the counterpart Selafiho - supporters of Sunni Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia - this group is small, but affects the European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But the adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It wonders how far are French politicians (and intellectual elite, so obstinately defends the general public) actually committed to the idea of pluralism.
is of the opinion that Muslims in matters of faith are likely to experience than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republiknstvm.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found "screws values."
It may be a Muslim? after reading this book may have a tendency to say "yes, but not now."

Certain charges has not been made public, but according to the Cuban rights may be a Cuban citizen or a stranger imprisoned for almost anything that is as "dangerous".
All the so - called kontrarevolucionsk activities, which include mild protests and critical Stati, raise the risk of imprisonment.
anti - graffiti and speech are considered to be serious offences.
in Cuba, there is a young blogujc community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Snchezovou, who often writes about how she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Snchezov repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country, in order to take the prices, but the permit was denied.
The detention of American suppliers may be the result of the growing tensions between the communist Castrovm brother, in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was monitored as a "delaying tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first report on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the cuban government will take concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, the United States take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought - after commodity in a country where the average wage of state employees is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted an ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones in this year; these are used mostly PRPO textovchg messages, because 15minutov phone call would cost more than one daily wage.

Personnel Administration rozkrvaj conspiracy, concerning the broadcasting of men in Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of the conspiracy, to the deployment of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan, to kill members of the, and said they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists terrorists who on the Internet and finds radikalizovan young men.
Investigators said the search for a personality, known as Saifullh, who invited the men to Pakistan after it first appeared, when one of these men, comment, the authorising officer terristick attacks Ma videostrnce YouTube.
Saifillh over leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the zone of indigenous tribes pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its camps for training terrorists.
But Pakistani intelligence official who submitted a report on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullh usvdovn was unsuccessful in usvdovn commanders, and that the men were part of an attempt the CIA infiltration into the terrorist network.
As a result, a few days they were transferred to the eastern sarghody, far from the mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were seen as a unit.
That is why they were, said the official, who spoke on anonymity anonymity of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not deterred and still trying to obtain consent to gain access to the camps of al-Qaeda, were arrested when they by law.
The case of the five - which remained in Pakistan and the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important to determine who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the American intelligence service is the highest priority attempts on the location of the human resources to Al Qaeda.
enterprise organizations act as, vyazujc those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
American Al Qaeda recruits were subjected to special scrutiny, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because due to their potential access to U.S. objectives and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the Foundation, based in the US, said that terrorist groups will also become in recent years, significantly more cautious in order to allow up to them, because the intelligence agencies received experts on their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which was already been so much? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those, which is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands in Copenhagen, called climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets, this Saturday and for stronger action on climate change from negotiators in the city center of Bella.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police odnaduje that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists put several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center.
on the day when the incident occurred in the talks on climate change, which sponsored the UN, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried banners with inscriptions, "this is not a planet B" (i.e., secondary) and one in panlttin that, "he says' enough '.
protest in several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensenov, which stated that traveled to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and provide me information about the dismal state of the country, which has the impact of climate change, which still occurs.
That's part of the reason why we decided to connect to this the great march - through the world and to appeal to the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry out, it still can not be avoided.
Police prevented the protesters to converge to the center of Bella and said that had arrested 19 persons, in the first place because they either masks or a pocket knife.
These activities are under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the spectators, who did not wish to be identified, because it is involved in rohovor climate change activists as athletes and in black suits the several bombs near the main channel, which is located near several ministries.
for buildings, said zahajivali flares, but followed by "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is likely to have penetrated the consciousness of key officials, such as Su, the chief Chinese negotiator on climate change.
When asked whether he was be a constructive impact on the international negotiations, said English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (actually it's something you do not realize).
He continued ntin and said, "because the venue is large, I can not hear what's going on outside.
He was the march of pain or helpful depending on the outlook for everyone.
You can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "can also say that this is a distortion of the negotiations or the freedom of others.
date of test revealed the persistent racial differences
The federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public school district of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country's highly productive systems, the certificate showed greater progress for pupils and classes in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last atestanho numbers of the National Center for progress in school are persistent differences in the knowledge between afroameriany and white students, and that both the local and the national.
The average result of white pupils of the District of Columbia over the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their peers nrstu only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in the knowledge actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
progress the african - americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant of one point of 245 to 245.
The average for white students was not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not big enough.
Image in term of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black students fourth classes in 2003, when the NAEP was first performed in the district was 60 points scale (262 to 202).
Although the result in children from oboiu groups during this period, the difference is approached 58.
Some advocates of education in the district in the last week expressed that the results, oslavovan secretary Michelle A. Rheeovou and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were for white students rozshleji stimulovny where there were already high results.
That would imply that we have increased the amount of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non - profit group that advocates equality vdlvn in the district.
Nesku up and down because of the diffusion of two or three points, said committee member of, Kwame R. Brown (d - at large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade elementary school in eatonu.
Often, management style of Rheeov, Mrs Brown said that a report on the results of the test means secondary education in the town is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It is clear that always want to see the virtues and I respect that.
But what is, that we did not pay almost no time and energy, which had to pay our middle education.
Mrs Rheeov said that the district is continuing in the search for better ways of addressing the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, Wilson reading system, aimed at students in higher grades of primary schools and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their school kariea significantly lag behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics curriculum and teaching math to sixth grade, emphasizing the games and experience of real life, which put them in the district for the former Director Clifford Janeyiho, can be attributed to the progress which has been made, a report last week.
and I think that we should continue to work and carry out the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of class, said Mrs. Rheeov.
Others said that the results of the NAEP clarify the question of whether Mrs. rheeov can continue in the overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary for reducing the difference.
It's a definite dilemma Rheeov Mrs Michell said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, where she the results of the tests in urban areas.
The conventional approach is to focus resources and administrative reforms at, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
so the focus to political repercussions, which are against important agenda.
But the complaint but also the other city, who are trying to keep the mean diameter between white and black.
We must focus on the creation of a system of large schools.
We have utuit affinity of our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be provided an excellent public schooling.
Mr Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element of the reduction in the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to place the validity of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days, able to push through the changes, said Mr Janey, who concluded an association agreement with its teachers last school year the 185 days, which to be a "flag" the search for a greater increase in the next year.
To make higher education part of a better future
Tour bus pulled into the track with a loud.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, and for a moment on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracielini parents barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Yet Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the land track.
Now she and other pupils eighth grade in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition was $dollars a year, their position was rather than visitors enthusiasm for potential students.
Yes, that's it! "she said, which would like to study medicine when the wizard offered to enter into the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said, when they a low ratio of professors to students.
The college was one of the seven which visited on his three -, and were now they occupied with the future message: the question is not whether to enter the house.
The question is where.
But this is a problem relating to the high number of children born in the US, Spanish immigrants who are excluded from the universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get a college education and enter the middle class.
In fact, fifth "duh generation of Spanish students from the college - remarkable results indicate that many of their parents, mostly Mexicans and people of Central America, in the United States, without having completed high school.
Their story is important, the researchers, because it underlines the point the way forward for the generation that has played a marginal role in the field of the force in the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they natural nklonpost to school and congenital assertiveness and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set their children high goals and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the American education.
But the school programs also play a special role in helping Graciele millions of children and, who would like to track - especially if these efforts in time persists.
If you take into account that children come from groups with low incomes, whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them norientovat in the system, free from any interference in each point is resolved, says Patricia Gndara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.

The federal program that funded the trip after the rails, is a useful example.

Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil ministry has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get the major oil companies to rebuild their its infrastructure during the two auctions, which took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of oil industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a significant role in the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, the decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have left with capital participation on two out of 10 vydraench fields.
Seven US companies pay for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has lost.
Two U.S. companies have reached agreements on the field, which was announced in June.
the participation of American oil giants in an open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and American companies here in the first place on the way Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq oil forum, online news service.
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for sale.
Safety concerns, highlighted by coordinated bomb on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of American army is likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has the third largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
American companies have in some cases at a disadvantage, especially the Chinese and other - controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc.. were the only U.S. companies which have signed agreements with the ministry.
Leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil industry and offer technical assistance in the past years, left empty - handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom the top shareholders in two of the contracts, which were committed at the end of this week.
The China National Petroleum Corp. contributed to the menus at more contracts than any other company, and left with large stakes in contracts for the two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic, as well as a technological power, said for the Ministry of Oil industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and to meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies, which have been provisionally selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the price of a barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for above the current output level in each field.

delegate of the United Nations in Kabul.
delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he wanted to withdraw from his of his post in March and end a stormy term, which was allegations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
To the left, because the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said that he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the timetable for the US in the state, which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO nations to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal Afgncm that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long - term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
the increase of the armed forces must be copied to the civilians, he said.
Eide said he resign, but that simply fulfills the promise he gave his family in March 2008, in Kabul, spent only two years.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
secretary - general ban ki - moon is now said that he needed time for a replacement.
As I said, it is time to look after the dauphin, said.
When I came here, there was a vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to officials of the UN Ban began seeking compensation.
Officials said that the decided between Staffanem Di, who has a swedish - italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and jean - Maria Guhennem, Frenchman, who led the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eideho position in Afghanistan was tested by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraithovi, who was accused in September President hamidem karzm, who won the presidential election of camouflage, the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied those allegations, but said that the allegations Galgraitha - which was released - "damage the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said that the proposed meeting with the representative of citizens for the coordination of relief efforts for the leadership of US forces in Afghanistan.
Also urgoval the of the UN to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries, which would be for the Afghan mission, because, he says, wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan and said that the heavy handed regulation on hiring undermine the UN its ability to use.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain since May, only one person, he said.
This is a disaster, and I cannot continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose on Iran "significant additional sanctions" because of a lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq during the weekly trip to areas where the war is fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to a question of a soldier on the likely development.
One of the things that depend on me, is that if I learned something from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is inherent unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration decided on a package of sanctions which could hit irnskou military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary irnce.
He said that "a package of incentives and" would require "to persuade the government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will be extremely suffer" sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion, issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration engaged European leader in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if not its nuclear program into full compliance with the committee of the UN nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop their expertise for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, indicated that he wants to return to talks on reducing their nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of its stocks of enriched uranium in return for badly needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has planted in such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to allow time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran withdraws from the interim agreements - partly because the expert, because leadership is irmsk on views on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in the iranian obstinacy to the international community of some proposals, which are actually agreed at the beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on a path that is not the terminology of additional sanctions against the, said Gates.
President Obama set for 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to search for other elections, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degradujcmi".
In its opinion, issued in New York, irnsk mission at the UN on Thursday condemned what she called "and unsubstantiated allegations" against some members of the Security Committee on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that he wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long - term solutions.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met this morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in kirkuku and Kurdish leaders in irbilu.
There remains a high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, in particular because of the border, property rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to zabrnlo delay US plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen concerns about Kurdish from persistent depression. Official cited by the US Gates when he told Massoudu Barzanmu, President kurdistnsk regional government: "we want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomiji in a united Iraq.
We do not want to leave. "
In an ageing China, change course
Weijia Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which read that "mother earth is too tired to fund more children" and "one child means a grave".
Then they a lesson that if the official government position in Shanghai, alarmovna low birth rate and ageing population in their city, suddenly changed course in this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: never.
We have always spent all their time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31 years, of human resources, which has 8msnho son.
More than 30 years of policy of China have only one child was introduced, and thereby created two generations of the notoriously boubelatch and zhkanch children afektovan "little emperors", threatens the country's population crisis.
The average fertility rate decreased to 1.8 children per couple compared with six than vpolitika vsoupila force, according to the UN.
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years and above, predicted to grow from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. That is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and above accounted for almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child of the couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission for population and family planning said, many couples have children, to "help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and the of establishment of the workforce in the future".
He says it's about "be old, that does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden.
The gradual
How has been inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
The pair, which violated the policy, face enormous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work.
China's official positions advocated policies that helped the country avoid critical of natural resources, while human rights defenders were sentenced to enforce policy.
In rural areas, some officials forcing pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexisticky selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
in recent years, population officials were progressively milder in its opinion on the one - child policy.
In 2004, as a rule, povolovali vce exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities and in cases where a man and a woman were only child - and in 2007 to mitigate the population of their passwords, the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing Institute of population research university, said that officials of the central government has previously debated the radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, one of the partners was an only child.
In June, anghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign for incitement to more births.
Almost overnight, the posters urge parents to have only one child, replaced with the regulation, describing in detail how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration has sent officials to plan families and volunteers, so that they can meet with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under the door.
also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The response was cool, said officials for planning families.
Zarmucujc response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai experienced an increase in interest of couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban precincts were reported changes.
Huinan urban district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Frustrated officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births in 2010 is still expected to only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Committee for family planning in Shanghai tvti Caolu said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, she said she would like to have two children, and they being legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, who have only a lack of health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without dociln zchytn network could be the choice of irresponsible.
People in the West consider the one child policy is wrong as a matter legal question, says Yang, a structural engineer, whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in volume with the first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples the psychological reasons hesitation.
Wang, manager of human resources, says that they want only one child, because she also was an only child: "we were the of our families and all of us.
We were not used for the provision of care and, in fact, we did not want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who vlatn translation company, has it much nepokrytji.
For dvoukarirov middle class parents, who lower birth rates, he said, be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30let dorstajc nahlej on parents as is the first days skho experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of ivita for himself, he says.
Just one child places enormous demands on time parents, he says.
Mother must sacrifice for at least two years of his social life.
Then there are disputed issues propstoru - "you have to rebuild your apartment - and the strategy -" you must have a resume prepared at a time when the child is 9 months for a good - school education.
Most of his friends, wants to be content with one child says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher ivitnmi standards, he says.
We do n't want to make too many victims.
The UN group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
UN the sponsored conference on climate change - reduction of neukznnmi position and mutual osoovnm - again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes ambitious greenhouse of gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations, most of the burden in the immediate term.
The text, which may provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But it was to progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week.
The working group created the UN ad hoc, this text, how much money rich countries should provide the poor for coping with global warming in the short term and in the long term.
and provides a full range of options for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to reduce their carbon output and what should be the upper limit global temperature increase, which will be policy makers able to tolerate.
It dodb process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the high representative of the club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested estistrnkov document zestrunn of 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what a top official on the issue at the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
The outlines of a possible settlement, in which could be the industrial nations to reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period for 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union on Friday to discuss his promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change - from with floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still Friday said the same type of verbal fireworks, which prevailed in the talks in the last week.
The US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with dobrovolnost for the main emerging economies, if not be financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration established the harder line against China on Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will accept the treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of actions, "said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to cover the limitations and should be examined by external observers.
Stern made this comment about an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the Central American negotiators on climate issues that either a lack of "common sense" or "exceptional irresponsibility" led the week earlier in the statement that the United States would not help financially China to to deal with global warming.
With the future of the world's major economic powers at stake, both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fighting is mostly on the conservation of individual economies, rather than on the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States on the implementation of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two of the most influential countries in the world to ignore scientific imperative for the implementation of the action.
Ricardo Ulate, delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in seeking to prevent the large issuers responsibly in their actions.
It is clearly a game that the new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelneln effects of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major participants, said that the best outcome of the talks will be the political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, created a draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur runge - metzger, who led the international negotiations on climate change in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations "a political tlkak on the whole process," partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
Negotiations led to a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that they have solved most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of governments compete the deal.
high - ranking officials, such as, for example, the Indian Minister of environmental protection and Chinese Deputy Minister stepped out of the aircraft and halls Bella Center to a closed door meetings and conferences so they could set a new claims, which will be assessed next week.
Total rozshlost of the Assembly - where the 13,000 people every day to and from the convention center, the guitar playing activists inscenovali night ironizujc spectacle of countries, which believed that put them forward, and there were on the transfer of proposals from hand to hand on the paper rather than by electronic mail - controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is only an extension: in Copenhagen were present almost all of the key ministers and in the center of the 60 heads of state.
We got to the high category, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for global policy for international nature conservation.

British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday feelings
at: 13 Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the train, which meant a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high - speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashfordu in Kent to London St Pancras and the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmesov and into the first high - speed passenger trains outside lLndn.
He hopes that the new service or, the Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains, and large urban agglomerations Midland, North and Scotland with London.
stagnant water should reduce transport times in passenger traffic and trade trips and the transition from aircraft and cars on the could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties to get for this vision.
But dozens of bilin pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about the environment now building the development of British high - speed lines.
High speed two (hs2), a company created in January to provide a government study, submitted its report to Lord Adonisovi December 30, as stated Times.
gave a detailed map stage of the planned high speed network.
The new trace links with the West London Midlandem was designed to five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods where the dopat on the propsted could be problematic.
In open country was scheduled to 25 m final route.
HS2 also expected to identify three options for high - speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis in the spring.
The preferred option is konfikurace y - shaped, with one high - speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The track should share with one near, passing through the branches of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and the other, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like it was the most efficient choice," he said, and expert railways.
Once this is done, journey times between London and shall be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before the year 2025, could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to run at a miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line been already proposes to the trains in the length of 400 m, which would be able to carry 1100 people.
To 18 sets could operate every hour on the route London - Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve the needs of up to 20 000 passengers per hour.
Due to capital constraints, assumed that the existing station would be expanded so as to accommodate high - speed network.
Experts from elezninhoprmyslu argues that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures, mean that the final decision will not be before the general election.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should build in parts.
Trains should be first put into service on the high - speed lines, but the existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is regarded as a crucial contact point for the transition from the aircraft to trains, a reference point for the revolution to rail.

This step has the support of the members hervho de charetta (for ex - UMP now for the NC), who assigns ownership of the UDF, because it was the first had in 2004 to register in the National Industrial Property Institute of (national de la proprit industrielle).

But 15 criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 let liliany bettencourtov, which should make the College three doctors.

As for the lawyer Francois bettencourtov - meyersov, Olivier Metznera, welcomed the court's decision.
It's great news (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier) confirmed.

The revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than ten years, of the behavior management of large company employees access to business - to - consumer marketing before the revolution: the point is to identify themselves with the "values" identified from the mountain, as it before, when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products which have of Heads of the ideas factory technicians.
that the customer has become a centre of entrepreneurial companies,. marketing strategy the market in the right direction... even if the authoritarian efforts to impose the products different from customer preferences, returning back!
Passive approach employees can lead to fatal demoralizaci.
Suicides at France Telecom, or and Renault are only visible parts of a much more general phenomenon, which affects mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions, including research and development and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And, indeed, EI "requires all interested parties (...) active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires from commitments which are completely at odds with the authoritarian revenue management.
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to workers at the center of the interest of the company as well as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys.
Internal polls - as the questionnaire submitted by employees of the company Orange - will contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I convinced myself that, in the face of the new situation, the structure of the various turns back as to priority... what i always do!
Furthermore, because that authoritarianism, as one of the power increases proportionately with the severity of their own failures.
Finally, because most of the workers a simplified view of human behavior.
because they are graduates for engineers have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
because of the convenience of thought take the old behavioristickou theory, is currently "neurovdami" from the US and without scientific knowledge of the institutes and the media.
In fact, it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey agency Ipsos Figaro. FR the pages, which only strengthens the management staff in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
to identify and measure the factors mobilization.
On the contrary, managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, provides the of vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic insight into all projects and practice management: for the staff will make commitments to the firm possible only if they seem like a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of the motivation of staff involved in the only study of functional analysis.
These studies have shown that their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxy, which will allow them to the image, which the company says, assess what offers them to realize their life goals.
Thanks to identify and measure the mobilisation of these factors may have the staff to check, and on its "social" and its management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a solid and effective economic intelligence.
Manifestation of the Oslo accords: "just war" Obama praised by the right.

The Conservatives, who at first at the price of Obama 9 October, this time a presidential speech applauded, including Sarah Palin, the former Vice - presidential candidate in elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, muse of right - wing republican, for the USA today, and added that she herself on the subject "sometimes necessary" war expressed in his memoirs, which are based.

The whole process can only impede the opposition of employers.
The FNTR speaks of "wrong" for 100 million, "it was been offered in the sector, part of the carbon tax."
Secretary of State for transport forced us to emergency, not as a result of the analysis, but to anger jedlky at the time of the Christmas holidays approaching, she complained Unostra.

for years, was for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.

Today, is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, remote 37 it miles from Moscow Center, "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro - and nanoelektronick research and manufacturing centre.
Since September 2008 established zelenogradt contacts with representatives of the scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and firms frankfurtskho Innovation Centre (FIZ).

Stuttgartsk brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 ca n't adequately prepare.
For fans of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
well. S21 is more than running the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital of baden - wrttemberg for a decade building a desperate chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Hlavov station with the rails, which ended in the city of, was then considered the traffic - technical fossils 19th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, because it was the need for much time to pephnut locomotives from back to front.
Go, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
and that is disappearing hlavov station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route the trans - European rail track between Paris and Bratislava / - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 1980's are no longer compatible with reality.
Themselves very ambitious designers know that, and the city is the start of construction almost neufinancovateln.
Since then, they do there are modern shuttle trains and motor vehicles at both ends, the head station have problems zajdnm and vyjdnm.
Yet: starts with 21, including a new line into the ice.
it and local politicians.
, together, and of the risks of an individual infrastructure project in the Republic borne by the taxpayer and not the state.
The project is still in some way.
A new urban space, which - if we are to believe the computer images - will contain many green.
For rail transport system is S21.
The station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980's - attributed the huge increase.
Then there was no competition cheap flights.
modern transport policy must go but first and the strengthening of freight transport, because rail transport is more environmentally friendly than the freight car on the road.
But the new line is not due to a sharp stoupnm suitable for freight trains.
even more important is that the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
In vbsku should bury good six billion euros.
This is the official number.
Experts consider to be the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade will miss the finances for the next uzlov points and narrow space on the network.
on the list of the Ministry of Transport is sixty larger projects.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 kilometers long route the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, on this route puts the slow pace.
There would need to a push.
But S21 will be as a brake.
Track Rhine valley becomes a bottle neck of international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.

Less tests

More than a footnote to hert mllerov
to get into and out of Germany's nice, almost no control... "is the opening line of a poem poet Werner Sllnera, which in this torn piece of with experience with came at picestovnm one dissident, gained freedom, but also for their language environment.
Sllner Werner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Bantu, he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a one of one child book publishing, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt am Main.
He was awarded the different prices, 1993 a poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002, is head of the literature in Frankfurt.
A considerable commotion took care last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which were a "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a broken mirror of its security act".
Obviously, and left a declaration, in which the writer Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William totokem, franzem hodjakem and helmuthem frauendorferem, accords to working as a secret of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present Sllner in 1989 German language prize.
Attempts at naverbovn apparently began quietly, first in 1971.
I continued sllner, ", someone who did not sufficiently attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Sllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize Hert Mllerov and its bezpkladnm literary addressing the mechanisms of the dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly community of German authors originating in Romania, shaken case, which indicates the depths and political system, which is based on the control and picovn.
Werner Sllner is not, at least if it can be said, the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but is also the victim.
in the Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after the Sllnerov of Michael, and referred to a positive influence on a secret agent Walter.
"me" in all the essential points for him, he says.
Has a moral obligation to make this note.
Sllnerovo statement was in this form and before the the unexpected, but very surprising return of former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta mllerov wrote in July, when reading their own, 914 parties that Germany was a reserve for Securitate.
the, it assumed, they speculate, and, in some cases, I know that the name is hiding behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Otherwise than in the domestic, meanwhile, have a look of the components of ingredients, is handling the Securitate very diffuse.
in the few years, systematic education and restricted.
One of the Birthlerovch offices, which corresponds to the National Council for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded in 1999, the issue of the act was done since more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of folders.
That former members of the Securitate still in Romania, a big effect, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hertu Mllerovou one conversation in which one of the former bosses of the from Timisoara, on nositelce dismissively.
has said psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
Potupen power here quite openly expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
of course, that the case Sllner, as in the context of zamlenm guilt, the inevitable questions.
Why now? who is? Specific responses to the audience leaves to expect that the continuation of this chapter will be the desire for knowledge rather than those piknut guilt and shame.
the genesis of Mller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote.

Worlds dreams
Some see the images and voices that other people can see and hear.
not only the mentally ill or drug intoxication in the boundaries between imagination and reality.
Until this occurs during sleep, everything is all right.
If we closed our eyes in a dark room, we surround and delusions.
But who is experiencing a dream - states of vigilance, hear and see things that others see and hear, in today's Western world for a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as eccentric.
But such images and voices are not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Guilt is our imagination: the same processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there to take care of it of the border between dream, and reality.
Dreams altered state of consciousness may be present in various forms, at best, we call them a vision in the worst delusional.
Even if the initiator and effect may vary, however, vision mystiky Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the prophet new - age carlos castanedy, states of, and hallucinations derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when a derailment the balance of transmitr neuronlnch the brain - particularly dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholinu - and interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
comprehensive hallucinations and wandering thoughts occur very often in the schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The link between the and delusions of employed doctors and philosophers since antiquity.
Aristotle understood as a form of a waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychology, said in 1861 "great similarity snovmi with dream states" for the Sigmund Freud was a dream even "psychosis, with all the nonsense, images, the senses.
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. amended in comic figure.
His body is two - dimensional and brightly color.
Gravity over it has no power, near the ceiling of the room.
Feels the nakopnut.
Behind him the winged figures with blood red, cenc teeth.
Chasing him, him a heavy, shoes, throwing him on the wall, feel the pain throughout the body.
Loud, evil voices from the walls and on the radio.
We can not tolerate the voices that curse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, zauzl into the loop and put it on a hook on the ceiling.
up to one speaker and you can around the neck.
jumping.
loop.
Learn, a chorus of voices his eardrums, "go to the clinic and let yourself!"
Henning T. today's 40 years, has six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first nearly 20 years ago.
were running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivn paranoick psychosis, manic, it also takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with their disease, three years is married.
in psychosis, the worst fear and doubts, he says.
The ghosts are a reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is the second most commonly treated treatment of disease.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis are usually distinguish between internal and external world, into pebuzenho condition, which can lead to halucinacm, velikostnm, or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that command, comment or maintain dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The victim is unable to distinguish important from nedleitho, the brain can not filter out signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
like a dream opens the floodgates of psychosis, ideas and fantasies, which come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focusing on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief of clinic General psychiatry university clinic in Heidelberg.
A schizophrenic is located in the centre of the stage, everything has meaning at him.
at the same time, into a passive role, it, like a dream, overwhelmed by events and can actively shape.
It is therefore often feel threatened, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible for them, they are a terrible reality, is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime experience
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but still sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, substantially preserved."
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality and experience of alienation in a real framework.
Scientists are still a puzzle to why our brain is doing exactly the sort of.
The exceptional conditions for each person can lead to lose in the short - term relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone, however, develop into psychosis.
it seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in an early stage of development, the damage to the brain, such as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle, as there is a failure of the system, which in the for years did not materialise.
, if it a role of the - stress or traumatic experiences can be the effects of psychosis to her disposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because the transmission system.
When our brain
Crazy is that, psychotronici suffers hallucinations, and to get rid of them, expensive medication, others give money for drugs to get it, he says professor Erich Kasten of Lbeck.
If we perceive as a pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of attitude.
for ten years, and, in the last year interpreted its results in the book "Die Welt in unserem" (the world in our head).
Although hallucinations belongs to a typical phenomena accompanying psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as borderline or depression also often diseases like, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, a healthy human brain.
hallucinations, according to Kasten, of the contents of ideas, which are normally suppressed.
Arise when the part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are too little repressed or active; if our brains, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can run this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimulus, stress, worry about love or other more exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, and one third of respondents had reported that at least once in life experienced hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in meklenbursku - and go to grammar school.
In fact, a normal girl.
If there were not the shapes and voices.
the, it may be that it will appeal kolohnt with long, dark hair.
When he replies, looking at her classmates with a surprise - no one except her see and hear the boy.
This shy girl as a dreamer, but Sarah K. nesn, knows it.
He is awake, hears and sees the boy, just as they hear and see the girl sitting next to the bench.
He can feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, the boy.
I'm crazy?, asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears.
in the night are rather depressing.
They are often a burden.
When sitting in the class, not how many teaching, because a teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains everything all, and visible on the board of the mathematical equation.
in the night are rather depressing.
When waiting in a dark room to sleep, which is rarely and too late, often cannot, if it's up or if, if the images he sees,, or a girl with wounds on the hands and feet are open or closed.
Leave me alone, shouting at the figures.
parents and friends say anything about it, would think about, that's crazy.
The autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years.
Last year did high school graduation and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago hallucinations ceased.
Since she contacted on the internet psychologist kastena, knows exactly that mad.
images are also art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or had taken incentives will likely hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain then does not have enough employment and old for his own amusement.
Sarah K., an only child, she was a little girl fear of the other children, often by herself.
Her hallucinations began when, at 13, she learned that the man who says he since she thinks is her own father.
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that process also real images and sounds, is for people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from one another delusion and reality. "every experience," says kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality shows there.
hallucinations are also images that allow the brain, so real. "
Also evaluates Kasten the dreams as a form of hallucinations.
Hallucinations healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
to schizofrenikm are mentally healthy people able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
therefore advise their patients to hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
the border between dreams and hallucinations
In our world, the concentrated too much on the consciousness is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, patologizovn, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard professor in Heidelberg and the psychiatric hospital and clinic - in Dsseldorf.
Psychosis is heavy, trpn disease, but it also provides the positives, creativity - a mirage is also the art of despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard the so - called oneiroidn form of experiences, a special form of the amended consciousness to dream.
Oneiroidn states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which is considered to be the real and ca n't even re - distinguished from state.
Oneiroidn state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as polyradikulrnm patients who experience fully conscious motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and herself, to be continued, complete inability to move, replaced by the real life - threatening situation, own, an imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt - Degenhard.
The type of the state between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change in worlds, the real situation but zptomn the idea.
Intensive form of aid and the transfer of the senses in some senses an intolerable situation, which allows people to their own ability to shape, move in an a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, and later in the memories
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen oneiroidn describes his experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (heart) as a rescue mission.
He was 49 years old, when, after the heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplant published his consciousness on several travel, with his body lay motionless in the intensive care.
Claussen plunged into a world that had, visited a time and place: it is an old man upoutanm on the bed in a train sanatorium, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between, which produces the narcotic substances from the blood.
on a motorcycle it can say to his country, in a hospital bed in the Alps, and meets the Korean.
Completely immersed in an imaginary wrong, everything is real, and later in memory.
These internal path for Claussena fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different status, describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams are memories of the mental disorders for years and in the details clearly obvious.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience is smashing the horizon of our other opravdivch experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
After all, show oneiroidn states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also up our internal images of external reality.
Any change in the of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, "may lead to distortion of what we call reality."
The fact that may also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
In the 27 to take over the children.
New head of publishing Kallen is a temporary solution: long - term Hubert Burda wants to forward to his business into the hands of their two children, said Spiegel.
holding is also in the future include 100 family.
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the long term, in the hands of their children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the company, says the man.
details, we carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, is considered later.
The question of whether to have the ability.
It is not possible to take the 7500 employees their children if they are not sufficiently capable of.
that would kill both children and business.
Burda Thursday announced that from January from the presidency of the board, and appointed as his successor, Paul - Bernhard Kallena.
52 years since 1999 member of the board of directors.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with added responsibility for the assets of the company and the resignation of jrgena todenhfera also direct marketing, cizina, printing and finance.
for the first time at of the in publishing any of the family members.
Burdovm children is 19 and 17 years, his son, Felix, which would today was 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment also serves to make a "10, 15 years," he said.
Holding should in future include 100 the family, says Burda.
with regard to the cases and Schaeffler Burda expressed it, that neither the family businesses do not have the in before the agency: "it's always firms, which have been infected by the desire of capital, which speculated and thought that they may become major players.
It has never been my strategy.
He never had "dreams of a world power," says Burda.
The as political system of the country, was Springer, and I do not want to play the World League with "time", these shops are too big.
Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to view the mail, without the ability to view a type of annexes or surfing in the network.
Enjoyed their five minutes of fame in the US, when Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
See it is difficult to there, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphon peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After the success of the company has started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, second on the basis of permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay for the Peak six amount.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web, is the European version of the invention, while his third transformation.
is limited as well as his American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
Monthly cost for maintenance is around 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe.
people with smartphonem already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently search caf with WiFi (or connection fon), so they can see the mail.
The idea of roomingem at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be in place a long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics, in order to understand them, and very good glasses to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission has requested to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it, still has the name Fon, when does not wifi) accomplishes this type of fare, means that operators are beginning to think otherwise and considering the various offers, ktermiby kompenzovali its data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offers downloads of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contract, no complications.
This device is connected and, for the purchase, rather than months.
and that's exactly what I expect that in ppadFonPeek, it is a possibility to purchase permanent access as the Peak has already been established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I viewing mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it, because I think that it's from the consumer point of view the best type.
It would be interesting if the same system used in the computer.
Color, kterouzbouje Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color first ladies.
for the of Barack Obama to us president chose a dress and coat in this colour, the same color also chosen when it was him on the second most important moment of his life: the transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition, the fact that this is a similar color - lime with effects - in both cases, it was the ensemble - clothes, and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of Princess, and wear similar clothes.
The substance, which is made of clothes, both models significantly different.
on the occasion of the investiture Michelle used a lace, in Oslo, velvet with.
Amend and accessories: green shoes with medium - high podpadkem, nynpodobn model, but in a golden colour.
They wear different hairstyles: tentokrtdrdol, before her hair.
75% of working mothers work problems associated with maternity.
Discrimination in employment in recent years has increased, especially in younger, which they intend to buy a child.
This is the result of the study and the career of Spanish women 'is carried out in cooperation with the Institute of women.
The study by 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited options in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of the partner is are many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part time or do not have a stable job, start with a partner to live before, their first child before giving birth and generally have more children.
From the other side, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"women from 35 to 49 years with stable job have their first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of living with a partner. This is the case of 4.1 in women, kterdosaen his stable job to pay the greater part of his life and have therefore the partner coexistence and the arrival of children.
The type of profession is also a strong influence on maternity, although a smaller influence on the opening of living with a partner, "explains Margarita Delgado, which is devoted to research in the csic.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage anarozen child is the degree of education.
Research indicates that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
differences are also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49 years of women with the basic and higher education given their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education and gave birth to the first child before they find stable jobs, while women with the middle or high education reverse they prefer to obtain a stable employment, before the marriage and the birth of the first child, "Delgado.

Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother was going through our neighborhoods, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people the kolemn aged 15 to 18 years, and our dog, from the shelter of a maximum of six pounds, without a word it twice and severely wounded.
Our indignation is all the more that we see anything funny in such aggression against a small and helpless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident while on a walk with these individuals, she began to worry about their own safety, since such a devil of a man who attacked the animal is able to do the same, as a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he was.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
Dog all day.
of course, we have lodged a complaint to the nearest police station, but that it was, and to a delicate issues, we see that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationality.
Outrage led us to this fact.
understand what is happening with today's youth, when they talk that troubled defenceless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not understand, where good manners, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helm
Tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial) launched a campaign to promote the use of Helm, especially for younger motorists, today both of these bodies informed.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, it is the only means by which to prevent head injuries or death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
The company Michelin indicates that this campaign is part of their obligations regarding the transport safety, which means more than design and to even safer products ", and confirmed that trying to fulfil this purpose and otherwise, i.e. in the form of training and information campaigns.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets when riding on a motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' is the first phase, in which more than 500 motorcycles will be deployed on boards to get to the attention of the public.
and, Michelin warned that transport safety is a constant problem "of the company, which is a manufacturer of double - of tyres for vehicles and whose main aim is the continuous improvement of product safety.
The sales of light commercial vehicles
After nearly two years, the market is starting to light commercial vehicles.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and what's more, this is the first increase after 22 months of decline, according to figures patrontn Anfac Ganvam organization of producers and sellers.
The positive data, however, it is in quarantine since November 2008 is very bad period for benchmarking and marked a 60% reduction compared with the previous year.
The consequence is that, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months are about 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January was prodno95. 853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick,, less freight cars and light trucks / bogies.
and gloom which, even the most the demand, even if it is bought by private individuals, the majority of purchases were made smaller and medium - sized, and almost 100% of the cases, the financing through third parties.
The constraints arising from the conclusion of bank loans, the source must be added other factors such as the cessation or continuation of bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike the, support for the purchase of 2000e too.
In addition to private individuals, it is to be noted iosoby business to commercial small and medium - sized businesses, which they intend to purchase a light utility vehicle to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvamu again reminded of the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association expects that 2010 will be to develop similar to last year, according to calculations, the sale of passenger cars and 4x4 falls by 19%.
Support system for the brake is already mandatory equipment.
as in the case of antiblokovacho ABS system, it will be with the ESP stability control, auxiliary systems hand brake, it all becomes compulsory equipment of European cars.
In fact, already form part of the compulsory removal of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is fixed deadline for the shortcoming, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, the works so that it can help to avoid many collisions.
The hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which system detects when the driver.
But not always able to keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by an automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident, neselpli brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the full power of the brakes.
To 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum braking systems, reducing the stopping distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, could be up to 1 100 fatalities per year related to pedestrians.
Reducing this number will be even more marked - from calculations in order to prevent one of the four accidents with the impact - after the introduction of so - called intelligent systems brakes.
In this case, the vehicle equipped with a system that (using radar or cameras) captures the obstacles and reports to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver's, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if is needed.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision can not be avoided, what impresses most intense installations on the brakes and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors the plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees in the company Opel Figueruelas (Zaragoza), the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably 8 April - as informed as Javier Ortega, an American manufacturer, notes that the recovery plan for Opel will need more time.
Nick Reilly, president of GM Europe, is to to each point of the plan was first agreed with the party, which concerns.
and, as a result, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the staff and then the governments of individual countries in which the production plants are located, will be issued a delay the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the contrary, assures that the decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in these days.
No wonder, then, that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer, as soon as possible to take a decision.
GM allows some of the new contacts with potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to acquire Volvo, but considering the possibility of Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group.
in the event that it will not be possible to deal with any of them, GM could sell some assets Saab Chinese society Baic.
decides to continue to pay the at the end of Saab, if not its sale.

After days of wine and roses since last spring, when assets inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets again emerged on the markets uncertainty, which should not come as a surprise, because it is already the natural state in an environment where managers take decisions on the future, which itself is uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the debt market was the of by direct purchase of assets and liquidity in the indirect release rate close to zero, the financial institutions to buy assets to the deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets, has virtually ended, and without undermining their disparate liquidity policy, starting to throw some sand into the wheels, as it in the Spanish central bank, with its auctions last year.
Investors, therefore doubt on the ability of the world economy to keep the economic recovery without the heterodoxnch measures, and participate in the return of risk reduction of.
Mobility and Exchange differences dluhopisspolenost regain points, although they are still very remote abnormal levels, which reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected the public debt.
again, on the quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for investors, thereby expanding the differentiation of the euro area countries to Germany.
Spain this instability was almost affected, but at that time came, Standard & Poor's threatened a new revision of the of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is useless for supporters of moral hazard, who again tried to pose to the conscience of the persons responsible for the world's economic policy because of the devastating consequences of reducing the loan on employment, when in fact it would be to declare a new day thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the Emir to restore power in the Emirates, and as for Greece, that we have seen before.

Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duro Barrosovi.
does not make sense that the Ecofin saving Hungary from failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow member countries of the euro has not fulfilled its obligations.
But what makes sense, it is that the Ecofin forced the Greek government to transparency and its citizens to a shared responsibility in the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the normalization of the premium the risks, after some of the positions would be in line with expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in the public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry about.
If the European reduced and our differences will be further expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
Matter Standard & Poor's is a anecdote. When our leading indicators of the majority of studies to anticipate the renewal of its scenarios and revise its scenario rise for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to the Japanese, for the Spanish economy a great chance to meet the survival of this warning.
Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy assets, although for the time being "careful, the drivers.
