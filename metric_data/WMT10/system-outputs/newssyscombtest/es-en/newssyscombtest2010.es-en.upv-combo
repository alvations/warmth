The lack of snow in the mountains of concern to the hotel
Not only the peacekeepers of Telesquíes in Krkonoše are about the runways without snow.
The lack of snow makes people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why, in Krkonoše can still be free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors in our pages.
People looked look offers, checked prices, but still fear of book with commitment.
And if we call, they ask immediately on our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud, "mentioned the mantenedor of information portal Jandura Martin Jandura.
Those who want to move in a Špindlerův Mlýn a according to their expectations, should not hesitate more in reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Špindlerův Mlýn offer especially all weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I believe that the will continue offer, but soon bend and provide shorter stays.
And then the rooms free will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer beds free for all the dates of winter.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remains free.
That is why we have already prepared some Christmas stays at the last moment, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí can also offer New 's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
Sold very well also the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold to regulate.
This year the interest in the winter is hampered by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to move to the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the clues remain snowfall during the week, the dates of Christmas will run out too, Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to fill the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately five per cent better.
For Christmas and the New Year 's Christmas, we have the latest places free.
The Polish interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sold well, "reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the New of Eve stays are already engaged in the omnia Hotel, near the central parking Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel of Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, because we are about to sixty per cent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a bit weaker, but as fall snow snow, the interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel omnia.
However, at the moment, it seems that the hotel of Krkonoše they will the appetite of snow waiting.
On Thursday, should fall temperatures and, if there is rain, in the mountains should nevar.
But then again rise temperatures, reported Jiří Jakubský Hradec Králové, the Institute of the Czech Republic.
The repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the man intelligent man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, looking forward, demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, established three years ago.
Not only in the same text uses used several times the phrase “ like in Iraq ", but did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement:" a new way forward ".
It was he who three years ago criticized the idea of send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by the civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today are not nothing about Iraq in the news.
The reputation of Bush did not improved, however objectively left his successor an initial situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
The captains of field to ask him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley Mccristal. He, even though the traditional subordinate relations, submitted to the rifles undecided in the White House to a harsh criticism.
Requested 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president hesitate for three months, but it not nothing better, so at least misled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
Managed to get Europe promised another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most troublesome of the whole strategy of Obama seems to its begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this process in three years. The whole doctrine of Obama generated more questions than answers that offered.
Many doubt that the increase give the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq.
In spite Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organized, their leaders to respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: It is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreement is no agreement.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin of Potemkin. after he will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because to the confused, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even even establish a state that is capable of action, "a minimum target for the entire operation, it seems very real.
The horizon of the strategy of Obama clashes by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who know nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to soon return home," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, set the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as a statement of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans have less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what relationship has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, can of radically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions not have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years for the presidential election and that there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if whichever is a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year bonuses in cash.
The entity as announced to react to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, actions that cannot be sold at a minimum period of five years.
Moreover, the actions may be withdrawn in the event that had assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the power in the long term.
I suppose that Wall Street is fully aware of the way journey that should undertake, mentioned the former banking investor of the entity JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The devil is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having almost $17 billion (almost 300 billion Czk) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, probably exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuses for exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.

On the citation reported the spokesman for the President Radim Ochvat.
On their stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of $163 million kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals from the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, because covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Because of this conflict, are beginning to be controversial future activities of the cabinet bureaucratic Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of measures, imposed in the autumn by the government of Fischer to curb the public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long neglected serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, that can support in a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, believes the president.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of ČTK bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
The Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words like "judgments strong."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former government Topolánek. Will 200 million kroner.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for the next year was successful.

Mandela in the new Clint film, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: invincible, tells a lot about the country, their fight and their victories, although some critics say that the roles the play American players.
The history of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the US actor winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, asked him to interpreted in the film film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said to said: "When I interpret, I will have to have access to you.
The actor and two years, who received the prize for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of boxing Milion dollar baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being slave, the fictional president of the US, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, it is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their efforts to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk as he
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the team of South African rugby, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after their nation remains racial and economically divided.
Believes believes that it is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why it was decided to join the rugby players, who belong in the global measure to outsiders.
The South African team failed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela came to cinemas.
He had no another goal to play this role in such a way that was as similar as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to talk as him.
The actor said that if he and the global political forces in the same area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to estrecharle hand to Mandela.
I discovered that the apretarle hand, receive their energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling to know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember being called the door, he opened and the first thing that I told to François Pienaar in my life was: "In the film seem much higher".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the players and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: invincible received positive reviews and it also talks of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily magazine Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a film very well done film."
In the reviews of films on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 per cent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians did tests of a missile
On Norway observed a special effect of unknown origin.
The Ministry of Defence ended Russia recognizing yesterday that near the border with Norway made evidence of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, "Bulava", previously designed to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and prime Minister Mr Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, was not flying or there was a fault in the air.
In Russian newspapers write of "Bulavá" ” and “ a missile that not "
A missile that do not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was initially no problem.
At the end of the flight of new technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke out in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
It is therefore likely that the light mysterious on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, in reality outside the failed "Bulavá."
The Norwegians like from the first moment did not hesitate with a Russian missile.
The generals this time are saying that cannot be simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile aguantaron and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases were engines averiaron immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without mistakes, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost a per cent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue still claim that "Bulavá" a day fly without problems and even will take up to ten blocks Hipersónicos nuclear, whose total weight maximum is of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the trade unions. Cancelled all the extra work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, unions said on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman of the factory Automoviles automoviles Hyundai.
The direction, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a time for Saturday.
We cannot resign ourselves to our plan of plan, because it is essential which is why we proposed voluntary extra work for Saturday, 19 December, that is to say, it will work in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 Czk employees to work the time on Saturday.
The bonus will be paid by last Saturday, 28 November.

Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or can take a free day off on 28 December, that prolonging a day Christmas festivities mentioned Vaněk.
In addition, all employees of the shifts on Saturday will receive money for travel and for food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and challenging of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, paralyzing stop the production last week, the direction yesterday afternoon decided to cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned Vaněk.
The employees of the factory cars were forced to work two hours more shifts of eight hours and this situation continued practically every day until last week.

A Czech discovery: a substance effective until in the Encallecidos' HIV virus
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans is evidence of new compounds capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance enhanced is the fact that it is also effective against viruses resistant to medicines.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already accessible.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients be extended significantly thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus were not removed completely, will create the so-called resistant viruses; against them, no longer work medicines.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility to dominate the resistance of the virus.
Showed that substances called Metalocarboranos have effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way to all drugs used today, and therefore cannot solve the problem of resistance.
In its work scientists are new, ‘ improved ’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the albumin of the virus.
The metalocarboranos have a three-dimensional structure: two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resilient virus
The proteasis HIV is a albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and not create mature and infectious Corpúsculos of the virus.
If we stop the proteasis HIV, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explained in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short series organic, which continues to be systematically.
A little weaker, but more effective
The evidence of the effect of this series of substances against the proteasis HIV was conducted in test-tube, and also against their resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the in common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in medicines used clinically, however not lose their effect on the resistant in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, which the Metalocarboranos are compounds interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of Institute Genetica in the Academía of science.
Heat for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think its future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that it is time for analysis.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the cabinet bureaucratic with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if you wants to stay in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democración towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposals amendment by the left, by more than 12 billion kroner.
The chamber of deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the proposals of ODS, since cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus the desire of the government, that the amended budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and the sense of futility; the Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in case of adoption of the proposals Modificadoras, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká Televize Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
Pointed that which is planning to stay in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer will agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in government have nothing to do the nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The prime minister also should clearly say, if you will resign, if the House adopt other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to subsidies in disease, income, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: the ministers nominated by the ODS are not fault
It is the subject of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, stressed Topolánek in the news text of the US.
Recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that Fischer decides to to the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit in the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
But it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with this, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by members of ODS.
The Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS gave at the request of the prime minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the House of Representatives is likely to vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly calls to members of ODS to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS is not concerned by the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I not that my vote would be weakened.
The resignation of the mandate he knew that in the following months they were especially bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek.

In the coming days will close in US cinemas a new Hollywood movie, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech Esinvictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the Republic of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of the globally known fighter against apartheid what plays Morgan Freeman, who chose years ago for the leading role the Mandela.
The second paper, the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, interpreted Matt Damon.
With the premiere born of the reactions of the critics and the public

For many years dreamed of the role and I am preparing to play.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as they say - charge its energy, said in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it is good, whether through the film we can remember the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, perose concerns around the world, he added.

The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated into the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game was nation was born. Portrays the South African champion of human rights during his first presidential election.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was also the costume of the South African team national rugby and falls to the play. RSA won at that time the World Cup.
By entering the gramilla in the that RSA is seen as something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won loud sustained especially public white and the recognition of the white people.
The football perhaps will help people to unite and form a nation, mentioned the rugby player Chester Williams, the only black in the national team in 1995.
Still will be if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans however are sceptical, as he for example in an interview recently for LN an amateur rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.

Jančura will submit a complaint for slander to three Hetmánes of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will submit a complaint for slander to three Hetmánes Socialdemocráticos.
It is Michal Hašek in the region Jihomoravský Kijówcki, Radko Martínek of Pardubický Kijówcki and hetmán of Olomoucký Kijówcki Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned this in 20 minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended up signing contracts to the long term with České Dráhy.
All three hetmánes are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are taking the raisins of the cake", however brought only the supply for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České Dráhy, which is not true. We know the price of České Dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have something else to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
at the same time have the evidence of all the regions.
That is why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint by the continuation of the show medial of Mr Jančura, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and of my region and I appeal to the other hetmánes to do so also.
I suppose, also on this occasion will show clearly that Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and false, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures of the regions.
To Radiožurnál told that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
Clarified that the campaign will be carried out against the corupción as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions were agreed with České dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the commissioning of approximately 150 billion kronor not convened an aim.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of ČSSD, owing to his criticism of transport ferroviaro in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we leave, we will lose the licences of buses.
It presented as a member of ČSSD, I know, what Mr is, I am not going to say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine Neumococal will be free and voluntary
The vaccine neumococal from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However already appear views, that the vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcus culminate.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January will receive a free vaccine neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who began with the vaccine last year or earlier, you have to cover other doses of the vaccine well.
The first dose of the vaccine must to be received between the third and the fifth month of age of child.
Last year a quarter of families left voluntarily to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Parents however paid by a dose 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children needed four doses.
Experts experts estimate that insurance companies will spend in vaccines from 300 to 450 000 kroons annually.
However save in the treatment, which is needed for children are not vaccinated.
Until now, the state spent across the vaccination of children around 500 000 annually.
The vaccination cover was initiated by the so-called package of Janota.
The pneumococcus is the cause of the otitis media, but also of the serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of Neumococales infections in our country die each year according to the research in the hospitals 28 children not over the age of 10.
In addition to the Czech Republic cover neumócocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine it be compulsory
However at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be compulsory in future.
From January should be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, noted for example, Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their partnership spreads vaccines neumococales already long ago.
The experts at an international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine voluntary.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we now have to take, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcus.
At the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, say doctors
The president of the society of paediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they may think about the reduction of the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, relatively understand the political decision to initiating vaccination as a voluntary," said Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents leaves vaccinate against pneumococcus their babies.
The vaccine Neumococal is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save then in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
However the pediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members however they were afraid, that insurance companies could "take the money of health insurance."
Doctors so will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that the paediatricians invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, said Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have been asked to ban the construction of minarets and that there is a general warning on the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims (which in reality are integrating) in one of the most openly secular of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the latest work from the author “ what the French do not like the veils "(" why the French don't like Headcarves ") (2006), a study elegant and argued a problem which divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what they are saying politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen called “ Islamic spaces. "
He is a good listening that reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that most them them.
Should a Muslim marriage in a mosque or in a city (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims on the evolution and the rights gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
These issues are seemingly mundane issues, argues, things of daily life, those which concern the means more than the political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, none of them known, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to disseminate this argument completely.
The Conservatives doubt just the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from Salafi, supporters of purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But the adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Question to the extent to which policymakers French (and the intellectual elite that fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims are probably more unfair treatment that Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments with the secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived “ an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say “ Yes, but not yet. "
The most devastating picture of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat on the planet.
Defining the ice is melting at an alarming speed, taking with away the life that cannot survive in any other
The interests of the oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been approached in waters recently open, with diplomats, lawyers and now now, as a result of this.
In “ on thin ice "(" on thin ") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of face value the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson as a courageous cadets in 14 years, fighting only with the end of its Jerez, is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The offspring, while swimming following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the twentieth century, displayed to 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the premises of zoos are still generally a part of the area of the scope of an adult savage. The climate is almost never appropriate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was green with algae that grow within the areas without mincing its stripe.

Ellis resorts to stories of other writers and historians, and often returned to the threat that hunters presented to the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Eskimos in Motonieves used high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two nations cazadoras where the ice will last for longer.
In his new book, “ after the ice (“ the ice ”), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling tale about the science of the Arctic and a daunting look of how can transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists nor the oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
The travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century gave evidence for the first time about the movement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines in the Cold War drew up a map of the movedizos cordons of ice circulating beneath the masses of ice.
The exploration by satellite and the extensive series of probes fitted into the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals resistant camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed chorritos of saline water that is pressed while freezes.
But since the bear in the microscopic surface until the wonders of the Interior, are all doomed once the ice summer ice withdrawn, which it believes can happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, these could be us...
Marines among the 6,000 that placed wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Pfc. 'Angello Robinson, 19, 19 seven hours by bus to place a wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like to see someone do the same for me, therefore only treatment to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning for placing wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
In 1992, Mr. Morrill Worcester, the owner of the company Worcester in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year in different cities along the way, to perform events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths wreaths America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of the cemetery in Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the cemetery national Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery of the Park in New York City and the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and carry the SEK.
Charleen hunt, 70, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military career.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to give a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It is like visiting a grave of family.
Wrapped in layers of warm warm, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves of the First World War the I, World War II and the Vietnam War, because they are not so many visits as the new graves, the organizers. said.
The atmosphere was joyful, while the children were playing and couples were taken in the hand, while wearing the fresh pine to the Sepulcrales.
Every krona circular was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Near there, the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the air.
Some read aloud names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small white and black plates placed within the wet clay, for those whose headstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who enjugaban tears in their eyes in front of the grave of her son.
Handled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free.. My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone can remember."
Cuban officers arrested a contractor of the US government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government distributing mobile and portable computers in the country, said on Saturday the officials of the State Department.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, with in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the Agency for International Development of the United States and the World Bank.
Consular consular together with the US Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
The graffiti government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent blogger community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but it has been refused permission.
The detention of an American contractor can cause probably tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a rapprochement "slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobile Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new products and coveted in a country where the average salary of a worker of government is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and hotel for foreign visitors, and at some establishment of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Glory Berbena, official press officer in the US Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as delivering mobile free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program for Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba Cuba," a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
He Stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often leads to a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials Desenmarañan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they expect that the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, which moves the Internet in search of young radicalized.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them comments approving terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and their terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of Qaeda that men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, the isolated for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They are considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not inmutaron and even were trying to get the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when the police authorities Pakistani arrested.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, stressed the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has as main priority try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The of the organization acting as guards, not leaving move those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Al Qaeda analyses with special attention to the American recruits aspirants.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because to its potential to gain access to American objectives and due to its propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the foundation NEFA based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? Kohlmann Kohlmann.
It has been transformed into a model based far more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand "action" climate
On Saturday tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here through the streets demanding the negotiators who work in the Convention conventions beautiful center of the city, bolder actions to the climate.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city of the city.
In a day in which just happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists have through the city holding banners in English saying "there is a planet B" and one in English that “ Earth says' enough is enough '.
Several famous joined the protest, even the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the home of his mother, made me aware of the issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding, said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoiding any longer.
The police prevented the protesters too at the beautiful Center, and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or carrying of pocket knives.
Under Danish law, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified by being involved in the climate talks, some activists with sporting masks and black dresses placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
Were in the buildings, he said, adding that began as venting, but which were followed by "a couple of explosions great."
Inside the centre of the people gathered around television screens to look the way throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seemed to penetrate the awareness of key officials as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on the climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact in international deliberations, replied in English, “ was not really aware of the situation.
Then followed to saying in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is great, I can hear what is happening outside."
Noted that depended on the perspective of each define if progress was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal ratings last week on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools in the district capital.
Although the district is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the report card showed that students in fourth and eighth grade gave strides at a more rapid pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap in performance between students American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in fourth grade of the D.C. during the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their peers African-Americans grew rose only three points, 209 to 212.
In fact the difference in yield grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, falling a statistically insignificant, statistically, 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The gap that separated black and white students in fourth grade in 2003, when it issued the first Enpe in the District, was 60 points of the scale (262
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the District expressed concern last week, since progress held by the Chancellor Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven in large part by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole in to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates the educational equity in the district.
I am not giving leaps of joy by a difference of two or three points, said the Council member of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-Por accumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the scores of proof is that secondary schools in the city have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not spending the time nor the energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said that the District needs to find better ways to address the needs of students from low performance.
This autumn, for example, is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the system of reading Wilson, targeting students in the higher grades of primary and middle school, which dominated the foundations of reading early in their school courses and are significantly behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real-life experiences, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which is something of the progress reported by the Enpe last week.
Just I think that we need to continue working to offer the best speeches to those students who are below the level of degree, expressed Rhee.
Others say that the results of the Enpe highlighted the issue of whether Rhee can further increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here there is a sort of lurid dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, scores of urban tests.
The solution of conventional policy is to devote its resources and reforms of administration to schools located in the poorer sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political implications that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban it she is clinging to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is extending the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which it regards as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
To make higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus came to the University of Gettysburg with a strong exhausted.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years, fell and blinked during a moment before the white columns, the facades of brick and emerald pastures.
The parents of Graciela barely had graduated in a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, had never set foot in a university campus.
Still, when she and the other pupils of eighth grade of the group explored Gettysburg, where enrolment costs 38.690 dollars a year, their attitude was less of guests impressed that the potential of enthusiastic students students.
Yes! here is where I am! be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
Goodness, seriously?, said pensativamente, when the guide spoke of the low proportion Profesor-estudiantes school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited during his three-day trip, and had already absorbed completely its deliberate message: the question is not whether you go to university.
The question is to what.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of immigrant Hispanics who out of secondary school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who enter the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these Hispanic second generation graded at the university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finish secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's the country.
Those who look to performance say that often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes can also play a unique role to help Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Noting to low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined to students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour of the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as gear up, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement the programmes of university which start when students are low-income in the middle school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent visiting the university, according to the United Department of Education.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns by violence and political instability, the Iraqi government failed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, for two auctions which ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Ministry of Oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in the restoration of the oil industry, of Iraq, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are having pujado in only two of the 10 deposits auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements to deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asians and Europeans at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum of oil from Iraq, a centre of news news.
It will be a long time before something more is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while the American military are withdrawn, probably prevented the American oil companies risk more strongly in Iraq, which has the third most important of oil reserves in the world, said analysts.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, in Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have labor costs significantly lower and are more prone to take risks because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, spores in more contracts than any other company and achieved major investments in contracts for two main deposits.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic power and technological said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We have confidence that the Chinese company will be on a par with their competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
Companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers that were then with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each reservoir.
The chief planner of Qaeda has been apparently murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a attack US missile attack in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a principal planner of Al Qaeda operations this week, said on Friday the counter-terrorism officials.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh Al-somalí was one of the two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the town of watching Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to sources American and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unidentified aircraft, operated by the CIA inside the tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from look Shah.
The official said that local militants suspected have rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "bodies completely smitten."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two American counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-level military planner of al Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group's group outside the region of region.
Was devoted to conspire throughout the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guide of the senior command of Al Qaeda and translated resulted into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat that we to with us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking officers.
The pace of attacks by pilotless aircraft not by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a count by the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is be due to a tactic improved tactics by terrorist groups, that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly to suspected informers, said the site.
The top UN envoy in Kabul about to surrender
The United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would give up his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan backed by the UN.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can rely on the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, to work with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector needs to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to only two years in Kabul.
He said that wanted to notify the Secretary
The UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there had a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek for a replacement, according to UN officials.
The Officials say they have been considering to Staffan di Mistura, a citizen citizen-Italian wrote recently addressed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested to before his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused in September of the President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote in the country and cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was sacked, "certainly undermined the mission, because there was already much scepticism regarding the international interference" in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the forces led by the United States in Afghanistan.
Also also the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to more staff in the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limits of their powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the regulations cumbersome recruitment of the UN undermine their ability to attract talent.
So it is that the rules of the UN enabled me to recruit only to one person since May, said.
That is catastrophic and cannot not continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, said Friday that world powers will soon "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, he shrugged off the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that worries me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons," because "its people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences “ credible ” if its nuclear programme is not fully respecting the recommendations of the UN Security Council and its nuclear body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that it would return to negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and agree would make a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided in connection with the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted in early October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way in that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethink other options, including continue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations Thursday denounced what he called the accusations and baseless of on the part of some members of the Security Council about the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers," in order to achieve an appropriate solution, in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, was found in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of rich oil oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in projects in the United States, to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. American officials cited the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the regional government of will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
Do not abandon them. "
In a China that ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda posters that the sermoneaban on the fact that "the mother Earth is too tired to support more children ” and “ a baby means a grave "
Learned the lesson so well that, when government officials government Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of his town, changed course suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, her reaction was instant and firm: in any way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
There is nothing for a second, said Wang, 31 31, a of human resources manager with a child of eight months.
More than 30 years after the that of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously Rechonchos, children only spoiled, warmly apodados "little emperors", is a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy was effective, according to the Division
of the UN, while it is anticipated that the number of residents aged 60 and above explode of 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 cent by 2050. This is well above the global average of approximately 20%.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with populations of highly such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Family Planning Commission and Shanghai municipal population has said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging people and alleviate a future shortage labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the Constitution constitution in 1978, the one-child policy of China is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid a critical pressure over their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have abortions depending on the sex of the foetus, leading to a high innatural proportion Varón-mujer.
In recent years, the demographic officials have gradually softening its position on the policy of only son.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife are children only, and in 2007, eased many of its hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University University, said that the central government officials have been discussing recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only son.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight the morning, posters that families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be appropriate to have a second child and apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their houses and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that noted a moderate increase in applications for couples who want a second child following the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, it is expected that the number of births in the town in 2010 only reach around $165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But as many Chinese, have only the inadequate medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West sees incorrectly the policy of only son as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
Is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: were at the centre of our family and we were accustomed to all of us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and we do not really want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, the owner of an agency of agency, as explained in a more forceful.
For parents with two careers, middle-class, to reduce the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew up watching the fight of their parents during the first days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want this kind of life for themselves, said.
Even a single child requires a long of parents, argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, "have to reshape his apartment," and the strategic must have a curriculum prepared for the best childcare when the child is 9 months. "
The Most of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, marked so far by offensive positions and mutual recriminations, a renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that provides for ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations who carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step in the negotiations, which is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money would the rich to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies recortarían its production coal production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the document of six pages, summed up a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the official UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
Sample the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations recortarían collectively their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries recortarían emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Nevertheless, on Friday was presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The US special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the assertions that call for mandatory cuts in emissions of greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries move forward and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese vice foreign Minister He Yafei, said that the maximum US climate negotiator United States lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers of the at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies as to save the planet, with China and the United States face on their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the twenty-four countries of the world are ignoring the most influential scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to restrain the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will be at best a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which with 43 members, drew up a preliminary draft Treaty of 24 pages early on the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island nations has "political political pressure on the political process," in part because they are now consolidated and require action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister, fell from the aircraft and ran towards the corridors of beautiful Center, meetings closed meetings and press conferences, in order to delimit the claims that be taken during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people come in and out of the convention centre, the activists who the guitar performances night mockery of the countries that they are selling, and spend preliminary proposals of hand in hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only built: almost all key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 kmh of Great Britain redefines that sentiment of Monday
To 5.13 on Monday morning, a trial whistle Perforará darkness to point a way out of train which marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed intercity train the country will reach 225 kmh, when as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, to the St Panrcas in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport of transportation, be then the lady Kelly Holmes, aboard board the first intercity service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service connects finally Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connects large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the times of business travel be shortened and the change of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce domestic emissions of coal, as well as relieve congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still the high-speed lines in Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will submit his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the times.
This will provide a detailed road itinerary for the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be fleshed out within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
It is also expected that HS2 establish three options for a high-speed network wider turn to the North.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favoured option is being proposed is a configuration with form and in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch that to the west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
“ It seems that this option would be more beneficial, "said one member of the railways.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which is not operational before 2025, would allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with the little more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, turning the British network in the in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to withstand trains 400 Mt of length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of Londres-birmingham.
This means that there would be a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions of space of the capital, is expected to extend an existing station to conform to the high-speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only the station St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis announced whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that there will not be a final decision until after a general election.
Even if launches the work is the network would have to be built in sections.
Initially it would force the trains to stop the lines by the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining the journey times between London and Scotland over the three hours.
This is viewed as a crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage by a Naranjal of £75,000 a conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman of the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Naranjal that built in the home in their constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, which was degraded by David Cameron after complaining that members were living “ rations ”, increased its mortgage in £75,000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second home in Rutland.

The authorities in the House of Commons authorities approved applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of expenses of Members. Last night Mr Duncan said that applications “ could not be been clearer or more simple "
Mr Duncan, one of the Members members of Parliament richer, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed with Mr Duncan needed more space.

The Neighbors described it as “ a greenhouse for entertainment ".
He was not asked Mr Duncan to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on their previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271.406 pounds of property London at to of his constituency home, which he bought in 1991, the previous year to become a member.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was requesting about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications surged to more than £1,800 per month.

The standard variable mortgage rate fell from the BRE 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate that is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan was asking £1,250 per month in the month of May.

Delay Late payments: anger among the prison guards, is expected to take actions
The unions for prison guards called on Friday to a "general mobilization" to demand the payment before the end year holidays, premiums and the overtime, which was postponed until eneropor budgetary reasons.
The Force Ouvrière force prison guards union asked the staff out of service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning compared to prisons and "block" to report the theft of their assets.
The CGT union prisons (3) of the profession) summoned to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for achieving a massive mobilization," because labelled shameful and unacceptable" failure to pay in December of 'overtime pay, night premiums, Sundays and public holidays worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Union autonomous federal Autonomous (Ufap / Unsa), UNSA), the general mobilization (...) in order to increase the discontent and anger".
The direction of the prison administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of guards by guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the direction of the prison administration immediately implement a series of measures designed to this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime not recur in the future.
The pay of December will then be limited, except for the staff of the direction that enjoys the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and that "always blames the budgetary constraints," deplored the Ufap / Unsa.

According to the trade unions, not in all regions is the same, because some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not expected, said the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François forget.

The singer was operated once again the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles, attended her daughter Jade, to witness an act school, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and Traumatología of the Pitié-salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer accused of violently to Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurocirujano that operated the singer on 26 November at the private clinic international Monceau Park, in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, declared Camus.

In 2007, also intervened to the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a result of a brain haemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions by Malapraxis, as also for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the order of doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" defendant "regularly" before the Council of the order, and is "far from being desirable."

This indicated that the speech "was made without any problem," and that the results of the studies postoperatorios were "normal".
The operation "could not Provocarhemorragias and Portanto, not needed drainage," added.

Without doubt, return to the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I think it is very risky, declared Camus.
The association UDF closed the tone and warns the new centre on the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the modem () Democratic Movement of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt by the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (takeover bid) on the acronym of the former party Giscardista, Intimándole to withdraw all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced their intention to regain the acronym UDF, because it considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend its political heritage after reaching out to the left.
On the other hand, the defence minister, whose party is linked to the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of NC.
As support for its management, received the support of the Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current AS) who claims ownership of the mark UDF, because it was the first to in the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not wish to be deprived of it broke the silence to launch a appeal to the Minister and to the Member Intimándolos to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, under penalty of suit.
These last few days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose to his political movement to restore the acronym UDF, writes the partnership in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and MoDem, de Sarnez of modem, as Senator Jean Athuis of the centrist Alliance.
Also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the + Nouveau focus +, and the slogan + l UDF d 'aujourd'hui + in its militant material and the home page of its site, argue the signatories of the letter.
As we know, have no right to use the acronym, explains the office of the UDF requires that the "immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as well as of Internet site".
Also requests Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) marks the legitimate heirs."

In the letter, require that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978 and remember that Morin and his friends' elected 'leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as they had done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the new centre, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to join the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, "when when registered the trademark", it was no longer member of the UDF from three years ago," but of the UMP.
Takes scandalously scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do on their own.
This indiscretion is transformed into crime, report before a mockery of the strategy of the "We believe that in politics, as in life, is more worthy made his own name to try to out of anonymity taking fraudulently taking a name that is not right."

The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such tests, even more in the conditions proposed by the Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday will bring a report by 10 March 2010 in which must confirm whether place if Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and over what periods.
I believe that it will accept.
I am going to speak to her, said the lawyer lawyer, Georges Kiejman, to out of the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased by the court's decision.
Is is excellent news (…) the will show that he (Banier) manipulated to this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two two years ago, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against François-marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing it of being tapped for years of the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, who considers a friend of
On Friday, while the court considered the whether of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-meyers, allegations of lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said that little faith the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of the year 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
Since their wedding, never again able to speak with Françoise ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre Nanterre, once again, that the complainant was not in a position to appear, much as a judge of refused, in recent days, to to your request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person may appear in their place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that would once made the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-meyers.
Does managerial revolution or order of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of the intelligence of business will have been in vain
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalled the position of companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of marketing: it is that the partners adhere to "values" certain from above as before it was imposing on consumer products designed for the technical factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution of marketing gave place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are no to the factors of preference for customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly deadly.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects the executives.
This demobilization committed a grave development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of R & D and, even more, of the intelligence of business.
Indeed, the (business intelligence) (BI) "demands that all the parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision "; it needs by employees a compromise that is totally opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we convened a managerial revolution, which would be the staff in the centre of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Opinion polls have a relative utility internal
Did The domestic opinion polls, as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, will encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what always made! B989
- secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- last, because the majority of managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As come from large schools of engineers, interpret the psychology mechanistically.
Take, for intellectual intellectual, the former behavioral theory that the Americans recently recently, and that the institutes of Studies and the media widely disseminated behind their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commandos" (sic) of the commitment of the executive, a recent investigation by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanistic, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, is taking a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating any reasoning or practice of business management, a basic fact: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only possible if it is clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the analysis Motifuncional take this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own projects of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the factors of mobilization, managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate its "social" performance and relocate the management Derecursos human "in the place".
In this way, create a favourable ground for the development of a strong and effective business effective.
Oslo speech: the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the prize to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for the vice-presidency the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, leading figure of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she had addressed the issue of the war "sometimes necessary in his recently published memoirs.
In my view, the war is, of course, the last thing that the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists, he noted.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was devoted, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very well, was welcomed the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which appreciated in particular the mention of “ the existence of evil in the world in the words presidential.
At times, the speech I found very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program “ The Takeaway "
The former elected representative, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential elections in elections, was pleased to hear to "a president of left" when reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a prize of peace if the use of force did not exist
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a speech very American American."
In addition to stand as a "citizen of the world", as it always "" spoke as an American President "to remind the Europeans' living in a security bubble of security that they did not create and not do much to preserve it, "said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk in the era Bush, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the Internet site of National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the representative Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent he warned.
However, the press centre left praised the president.
Los Angeles time, although continues to believe that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, described his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented excited the Californian newspaper.
Obama delivered the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, judged "at the time of bleak and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations public-sector the trade unions of roads and the TLF (transport and logistics of France), the only organization employers who stayed until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
During the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "happy" with the agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators they parted at dawn on Friday, in the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (Fntr, (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) a by the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 h was necessary for all agree and the text is firm to 18 h.
The conflict have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that disturbs the end of year he declared Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international (transport).
The rate per hour of 8.72 euros 9,06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some rebel dissenting, added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that it is “ a good deal ”, although it was "difficult to grant increases to higher wages, bearing in mind international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) is recognized as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the expenses of travel of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extra payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “ a low of 100 million euros in charges employers' was the subject of an amendment to the government in the draft bill of correction for 2009, the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms."
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement is implemented, firstly, to businesses companies to this organization and, secondly, the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour make an extension.
It will be "as soon as possible," assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The Fntr complained that it was a “ of naive, as the EUR 100 million euros" had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to frustrate those who want to eat Turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner, regretted the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months."
A: conflicts over the weekend, unions with the proposals of the RATP
The conflicts in the RER the largest urban public transport in France, they are going to continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to their request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only move trains between 10 H and 20 H, at a rate of one every two in the central section (between the Défense and nation) and a train out of four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the Snfc will be suspended in Nanterre, which will force passengers to change train.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy "the RATP strive to provide service to the large shops".

The stretch RATP tours from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre until Boissy-saint-léger and Marne-la-vallée.
This Friday, roughly one in two trains circulated at peak hours, and almost no train in hours Valley, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the terraced thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at the dawn, the of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy-saint-léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained that it had lifted "an hour and a half earlier to reach timetable".
The station Saint-Lazare is not saturó, indicated the SNCF, which had for the supervision of police and law enforcement agencies.
The RER to operating the SNCF operates from Cergy-le-haut or for this arrived or departed from the station Saint-Lazare to join the metres.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Will Analysed the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the trade unions, a meeting that took place with the direction on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want drivers who demand a premium that to them, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP puts even in parentheses its proposals premium, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the direction "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and roads had already solved".
It provides for a further meeting on Monday to make "a more longer analysis on the conditions for the exercise of the profession," the RATP.
What also led to the trade unions to say that the company "did not imported for users of the weekend".

The Turkish justice dissolved the ruling party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the main party prokurdo of the country, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of government, which has just lend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he declared to the press, the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, though only a majority of seven votes to get the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the party leaders, the party, including its President Ahmet Türk and the Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that members Members of Parliament before being parliamentarians without party label.
The decision comes in the wake of a procedure that launched the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP of obey the “ principles ” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and by many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the rebels of the PKK.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic links with the PKK, but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and call on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the time the government it extends a hand to the Kurdish community offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights, for that the Kurds stop support the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a break-up could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south-east Anatolian, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, degenerated into clashes with the police over the past weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of south-east populated mostly by Kurds.
The forces of order threw tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters throwing Molotov bombs or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, also focused around 100 hundred people.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despondency".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) dissolving a party, told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, declared the Minister of energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction of the PKK, added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks of the past few months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret of weaponry.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "Silicon Valley Valley".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the headquarters of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies of the Centre for innovation in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were a number of mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and sign in Frankfurt Riedberg signed a Protocol of close collaboration".
The Vice-alcalde JURI Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In the 2010 travel to a seminar in Selenogrado representatives and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research centre of natural sciences.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility to put a foot in the Russian market market.
In exchange businesses Russian scientific companies to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major companies and research institutes Russians.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Technology technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called “ city of socialist planning for of research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "green City") received its name from the landscape of mountains, in which settled research facilities.
Of Stuttgart brakes
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not sufficiently high places for high.
Supporters supporters of the project is purely and simply as “ the new heart of Europe ".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which plunged to the capital of the region of Banden-württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
With with terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time fossils of engineering of the nineteenth century, acting as checks of a modern rail traffic, because formerly required an enormous amount of time was needed for locomotives back ahead.
Rolling, stopped in their tracks to continue the journey; but it should be done.
And why should disappear terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a season of which is approximately half of the journey of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan of "heart of Europe".
The S21 really will be launched, despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the capital hessiana and Bavarian is almost unpayable implement the reduction.
The terminals of course also have more problems of entry and exit, since there are locomotives reversible with unity tractora and cart driver at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 including the new tranche built ice towards Ulm already will be launched.
The Federal political and communal politicians have prepared as well.
The rail continues, also because the risks of large individual projects in infrastructure projects of the Republic is the taxpayer, and not the state.
From the point of view of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, many green areas, probably of the generated by computer the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The station step and the road are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time were not given the competition from low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first deal with strengthen the transport of goods, as the rail transport is considerably more than that made by lorries on the roads.
However, the new sections in construction we are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affect many other projects of projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zuavos.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen thousand million.
It is certain that in the next decade the money in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
In total sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transportation.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 is built the route at a slow pace.
It is urgent that we here step on the accelerator properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international carriage of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the autonomous parliament in Wiesbaden, whether it to lodge an appeal to the judgement on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned experts legal research of the judgment of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had informed in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the runway north-west planned at the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to regulate the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged in the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population of the noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it is going to lodge an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the representatives of the government representatives for refusing to appeal to the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the group SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises to ban air traffic at night, traffic, had carried made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of floor.
It is quite difficult, if you let him keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We keep our word."
The Minister Posch rejected the recrimination Schäfer-gümbel, that the federal government would be trying through misrepresentation of the law and tricks still get their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition did not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a decision legally legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As well as represents the opposition, would not have never been the claims of his group on the prohibition of night air traffic.
Banks in the US returned aids.
The big American banks hit by the crisis are stripped of their shackles.
The "Bank of America" returned a once the aid that he had paid the bank rescue fund out of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion). euros).
And also the group Citi plans to repay state aid, according to a report by the CNBC the United States.
With this the institutes are to free from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of the bonus to managers, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had secured about 19 billion of liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum amount taken from the fund itself, which had few resources, including by the sale of items.
The banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked on Wednesday night especially to American taxpayers: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the takeover of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The group Citi also aims to get money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported source of known circles, which the American bank could announce already for this Thursday increased its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the group Citi declined to comment.
In June had already returned its aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Rapid Election
In the end, it was faster than was thought.
Barely two weeks after the administrative council of the German television channel) ZDF the editor-in-chief of Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely also had no further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal is not adopted in the administrative board.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The result of the vote was not yet finalised the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with its proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against it. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure to Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
For most of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief of had been organized by the President of the government of Hesse, the Sr.Roland Koch.
Declined another mandate of the editor-in-chief of prestigious with the argument, which under the leadership of Brender news of ZDF would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which flageló political influence on the ZDF.
In the end until they had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which described the collecting of Koch as unconstitutional.
But it did not do anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
Studied studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philology.
After worked in the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper Frankfurter
In 1983 was changed to the ZDF, in principle the informative "Heute-journal."
Following seasons: 1988 to 1990 rapporteur staff of staff; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the morning programme "Morgenmagazins; until 2001, director of the foreign policy of ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint following the dismissal of Brender, which was elected even this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the magazine means "Medium Magazin."
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the Länder States should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way, that the proposals of the director cannot not be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the guilds of control of ZDF was ruled out by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Mr Peter Frey, recommended to the administrative council with a smart move: criticised heavily the guild by the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was could to name for the post of head of wording without losing face, as the administrative council could vote, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a thing.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded to the liberal left.
The academic careers are clear
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and culture of the Federated States finally relented. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve conditions of study in the cases of and masters.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: Basically each module of the race to end with a single review.
In addition to examine the workload of students, and we want to ensure a "real and justifiable
The policy and the universities want to simplify further the recognition of results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The Federated States are committed to establish more flexible rules set together to racing bachelor and master.
Regulations of the federated states that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the ministers of education and culture and the rectors of universities talk constantly improving the improvement undertake power and conclude with a successful career (Estudiabilidad).
Now for the first time there was talk of a in content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with only one consideration," said in a document of 30 document, which aims to regulate the adoption of the academic careers.
With the reduction in the burden of reviews" is intended to prevent the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the Estudiabilidad, as explained the director of the of accreditation, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future, "Estudiabilidad" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined thoroughly in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
The courses.
The students would have “ the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage the own initiative ".
These rules resort for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "reacreditar" once every five years. But this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which was installed by the Länder.
The ministers of education and culture called the States in October influence in such a way in the agencies, that the number of raw and reviews are not too demanding or demanding.
In some Länder universities and technical schools already reached agreement with the ministries to take such measures.

At the latest after the strikes of the education, now students as main involved should have able say say.
The chairman of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave its support to students: "We need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers for Education, with which the HRK deliberated on a joint document reform reform.
For the Union of education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union demands a legal right for each student with the title of bachelor the possibility of access to a career master later.
In addition Federated States must have to ensure that the current generation of students from bachelor exist in a future enough places of study to master with the best possible conditions of study. It reported a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The Federated States have quecontratar significantly more teachers.
But on greater access to the Masters, the ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"To in and out of Germany is virtually no said the first line of a poem by lyrical Werner Söllner in fragments language destabilizing in which tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany experienced by a dissident, who won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as reader in a publisher of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
To Söllner gave him several prizes for literature, in 1993 provided the memorable lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since el2002 is director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured their Securitate "
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Securitate secret service against fellow writers Alemanes-rumanos, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
Attempts to recruitment had started slowly, early in 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who is not sufficiently defended against attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate", completed Söllner.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and his controversial literary without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, it shaking the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors of Romania for a case that illustrates the chasms and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, by what is known so far, is not just a perpetrator but a victim.
In his dossier of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said the scientist literary Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner, and stressed the positive influence for him Delim Walter.
He had apologised or defended in all the difficult points for him, said said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
The statement of Söllner in this way and in face of this was unexpected, the confession of a Ex-disidente and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not surprising. much.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Securitate-spitzel Gewesen, wrote Herta Müller in the month of July in the weekly “ Zeit ", having read his own dossier of 914 pages.
Those involved have surely speculated and will known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany, the dealing with the issues of control by the Securitate is still fairly vague.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather dragged
Since 2005, there is a law governing regulates the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the recipient.
"She is has psychosis," in the end only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions arise with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame silent.
Why right now? What who caused damage? The calm reaction of the listeners off the confession of Söllner leaves hoped that the continuation of this story will governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, addressed a taxi Mercedes class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the foreign service elegantly dressed was emerging from a very nice celebration of Christmas, in which the manufacturer of goods manufacturer have distributed samples.
The man in the feature baldness had hired a driver, because we still do not know the city.
Moreover, it would also have been able to drive the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was intoxicated with joy the man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the final end of", namely in the Champions League, thanks to triumph 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, “ but we cannot allow ourselves to be blinded by the success: we will have to fight against the drop. "
The much more important “ I expected the next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the “ real classes "in everyday life in the league.
And to eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw lots
The final the end of the Champions League matches parties the 16 / 17 and 23 / 24 February / parties back 9 / 10 and 16 / 17 March) Sortearán sortearán on 18 December in Nyon.
So I remained limited the joy at the entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, short time they had inspired the bewildered profis of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on its strengths, I urged to be more fired, explained the repairer of souls Gross its recipe for success that simple sounds, but with the therapist Babbel already had not had effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, “ when in football there is a new impetus, sometimes things that had not been thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after a pause of several weeks due to an injury advanced quickly to become the best player local thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “ phenomenon ” earned with the proverbial “ wind ” and the manner of work of the new head: “ He is a man who in depth, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And that is what has been missing, of course, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sporting Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all record.
Like Gross, also the players and the manager abstained from overstate the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of relay and totally overshot of guests guests.
also had won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 had reached the sad awakening, gave to think Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no appetite to in his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in its headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which returned to updated in the form of a television interview, released just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, faced Heldt the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change their coach by the pressure of fanatics teenagers.
It also had removed his day off after the games Lehmann described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements of “ were marked by the pure selfishness ", replied Heldt, and announced consequences implications. the
Probably will no longer be friends forever, the two Cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the others in that, without previous efforts with the team of coach replaced, would not have been possible the spectacle of great strength of game and battle.
Babbel and their assistants had “ an important part in the success, "said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also agreed the man in the suitcase of plastic.
Fight of the world championship of heavyweights
Ardent mourning in Bern: Time and again the challenging Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended its title of heavyweight in the version of the WBC.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world heavyweight champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the association WBC expired in the night from Friday to Saturday in Berne the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the noqueo that everyone had hoped for.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be overcome because of their injuries.
The challenging Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
To some 17000 spectators in the sand of Berne, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 metres, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches lower, than before the mourning had proclaimed the end of the era Klitschko, was running again and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not move decisively to its target its dangerous skilful.
In general terms, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenging, and only tried to move the rounds.
While he was to Klitschko with words and gestures, their blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, which bore 12 rounds complete with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenging had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
Had insulted Klitschko as “ horrible zombie ”, which “ does not know do "
In undertaking the weight, the champion was left to provoke on Friday to take Johnson glasses of sun nose "in order to see their eyes. "
Fourth triumph following the return of Klitschko
Also at its fourth row after their return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, expired at the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered their belt of the WBC WBC, which previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year expired after in their defence of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is still collect all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he destronó in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company which promotes is planning because the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Wembley, London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack the opposition: The head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called liar to the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, because to false information on the matter Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin – following the most recent revelations about the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), have cheated with knowledge of the facts.
In the news "Tagesschau" on Saturday, transmitted by the television channel ARD, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister “ knowingly had not told the truth "about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, usually said: He said lies.
The order to kill would have given without taking into account the rules of the international force protection for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that had NATO, and that has read Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, had shown that in this attack was not only sought to destroy the trucks hijacked, but also to intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack in the United States, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the investigation of NATO, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Saturday for the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to action immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's policy the Afghanistan, and if the chancery, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had transcended misgivings about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the Spiegel, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely against the background of the attack on the convoy.
is officially had said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and had concealed details sensitive to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two senior officials, it transpired that they even had pointed to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a patrol of the area.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung. "
So far it has not received a reply, it was said.
The ministry has not commented on Saturday with regard to the accusations that been made, and pointed that this would be cleared up in the federal of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be the next Wednesday.
Worlds Oníricos
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
While it during the sleep, everything is in order.
When we are acostados in our dark rooms with closed eyes closed, we can without hindrance to the more wild imaginations and creations of the fantasy.
However, who experience States similar to dream during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, is considered the most modern in the Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or the
The blame lies with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make blurring the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of consciousness oníricamente modified warning may appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases call visions, and at worst madness.
Although it can distinguish the triggers and effects, it can refer to similar processes visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, experiences psicodélicas of the prophet of the new era Carlos Castañeda, states of possession chamánica, and the and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when it has descarrillado the balance of the neural substances of communication in the brain – especially the dopamine, serotonin and acetilcolina – and is disrupted the interaction between different parts of the same.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very frequently appear hallucinations complex thoughts and frenzied.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors from the former era.
Aristotle envisaged the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with states oníricos," to Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the absurdities, alocadas formations and mirages of it."
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, deformed, Rechinando teeth.
We are pursuing, themselves with heavy boots and Flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices shrill and malignant resonate from the walls and the radio.
Can no longer withstand the voices that insult and offend.
Henning T. starts two cables from the stereo, the amarra to form a knot of hanged, and fixed in a hook on the ceiling.
You climb in a bocina and put the noose around the neck.
Jumping it.
The rope was loose.
What you will serve as a lesson!, the voices in a chorus that is the eardrums, “ sees the clinic and do you heal! "
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has undergone six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of death was the LSD.
His diagnosis is esquizo-emotional-paranoid psychosis, is also Maniaco-depresivo, takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with the disease, for three years is married.
In the psychosis I experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he said.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics treating her as the second most common disease after the Depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of anxiety that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disruptions in the relationship, or ”.
Especially widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, say, or dialogue.
They are also frequent the optical hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signs, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream, also the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deep layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, said Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the of general psychiatric of hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time enters a passive role, as in a dream, is overwhelmed by events and cannot organise actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, the impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in lifetime
Unlike in a dream, said Fuchs, "the spatial structure and sensory structure of the reality in the psychosis remain in principle as "
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still unknown why our brains unfortunate mishaps.
According to Fuchs, the states of exception can lead to any person to lose touch with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that in addition to the genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage to a minimum.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains seen how this alteration of the neural system, which moreover, is in at all for many years.
The the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience may be the trigger psychosis when there is already a provision provision.
Similarly, the hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the system transmitter in the brain.
When the brain warms
The illogical of all this is that people suffer with their hallucinations and take medicines very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor in psychology Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
The perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often hinges on the point of view.
Kasten collects from ten years ago reports of hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the book die Welt in unserem Kopf unreal world in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, together with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as tablet, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and injuries Craneoencefálicos.
In a surprising and under specific conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that normally are repressed.
Arise arise when the brain areas of the brain that processed sensory perceptions are hiperactivas or are little cohibidas; when our brains are hot, but also when there lack incentives.
The drugs can cause this state in the same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, the stress, the evil of loves brain or other states of exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, Mindestens einmal im Leben Halluzination Erlebt zu haben
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and to a college of secondary education.
A girl.
If it were not for these images and voices.
Sometimes, during the it happens that a boy clumsy with long hair and dark he runs the floor.
When she replied, the other students the look Soprendidos; no one, part of it, hears or sees the boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoñadora a bit odd, but Sarah K. knows that he is not dreaming.
Is is awake and sees and hears that boy, in the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting in the next
Can feel even their presence, at least a few moments.
It is a good feeling, likes the boy.
Sometimes wonders wondered whether it is insane.
Also also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When I is in class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because Professor – their eyes and ears – is presenting a new colleague, while for the rest explains so visible and audible the mathematical equations.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often comes too late and is scarce, not able to tell whether it is surprising or dreaming, if the images we see, the nose or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear to their eyes open or closed.
Leave me in peace, shouts cried to the figures.
Their parents and friends told you nothing, would that is insane.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. has hoy20 years.
Adopted last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since he has come in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that he is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very likely that after a time begins to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is unoccupied Yse charge the same sought entertainment.
Sarah K., daughter only, had little fear of the other children and often playing alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, learned that the man known called Daddy since has use of the reason is not his biological father.
Since the noise and visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process impressions real and noise, those affected as Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. "Each experience, "says Kasten, “ takes place in the brain, the reality is planned there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so look so real. "
Kasten also classifies the night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, people psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten recommends that their patients who appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation between dream and hallucination
In this world too focused on what aware, the experiences often tend to generally Patologizarse, said Michael Schmidt-degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and medical clinic chief of the psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a disease hard and painful but that also involves something positive and creative – the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneirismo, a special form of awareness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The hallucinations oníricas almost dreams are very complex and detailed that the person who considers feels real and that subsequently cannot not differentiate the lie awake.
The States aware oníricos arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or illness, as for example in patients with Polirradiculoneuropatía, experiencing a paralysis remain completely conscientes. die EIB vollem Bewusstsein Eine Motorische Lähmung Erleben.
According to Schmidt-degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or in the world due to a motor disability total and permanent, it replaces a very dangerous real situation very dangerous for a world and that is decoupled from reality.
A form of extreme situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive to give meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in that our own creative ability allows us not sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, Zurich, described their experiences Oníricas in his book Herzenwechsel as an a rescue of the soul.
was 49 years, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after an operation of the heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the station of intensive care.
Claussen descended into a world created by the same and visited places strangers in other times: was caved in a bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot for their health.
It was in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by noble that produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike was kidnapped in their country of origin, made surf on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow Firn and encountered a Korean Korean.
It gives in these facts imaginary, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these journeys interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the trips are mental, many years later, much more clear, even in the details irrelevant.
More more clear and intensive even that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-degenhard.
Finally, the Oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile the internal reproduction of reality outside, even when we are awake.
Every amendment of the state of conscience, sums up the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Crude
The children will take charge of the editorial with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert crude wants to leave your company in the future in the hands of his two sons, commented to Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – the publisher Hubert gross sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and have committed to enter the company, confirmed gross, 69 years, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not adequately trained for this.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Crude released on Thursday that he will retire from January the presidency of the board and that Paul-bernhard Kallen has been appointed as his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, 52 is since 1999 member of the direction of crude.
a start was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the Treasury and with that came the responsibility on the heritage of the company. Following the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing, the alien, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the publisher.
The children of crude have 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently would have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to bridge the gap of 10, 15 years," according to gross.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Gross said that family businesses are not immune to the decadence: "This has always affected families are transmitted by the lure of search for capital, which have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur," says Gross.
I do not see it as a political politician in this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play with the “ time ” in the world League; these businesses have become too great.
The promise of Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail, without even to see some kind of Deputy or surf the net.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named one of the products of the year.
See you on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a monthly quota very low, less than half of what is paid, for example, the plan of data iPhone.
Given the success the company has brought two new devices: one exclusively designed to Twitter, the other with a free service data for life in exchange for pay six times more for the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Web, is the European version of the invention and its third Encarnaciónn.
It is as limited than its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, of 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or desperately seeking a cafeteria with WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming a fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago that would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated ear pulling of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
A aparatito as Fonpeek (never ceases to be curious that bear the name of FON when lacks WiFi) achieves this type of tariffs means that operators are starting to think differently and studying study different proposals with which to pay off data network network. data.
Kindle is another good example, includes trafficking of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and bagpipes.
It is a connected device connected and paid for it to buy it, not month to month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with Fonpeek, an option to purchase with access for life as Peek already has in the
Not because there will buy it.
I watch my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I believe that it is a model fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The colour fetish of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the tone of the American first lady.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president with a clothing and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has led a model very similar on the two occasions: In addition to being a similar colour -amarillo verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress was composed of three parts -vestido, jacket and shelter of the same - and adornaba with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the trail of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat Vestaurio.
But the question which are produced the two suits makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fit fat, in Oslo is a velvet with stamping.

75% of working mothers has had problems working work for maternity
discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about that 75 75% of working mothers has saw limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence of couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they
Those who do not have an work outside the home, working part-time, or have a stable work, initiated before the coexistence in partner, the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delaying the coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged between 35 and 49 years with permanent work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time of record life to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed wields much influence on motherhood although less on the timing of the pairing, "explains the CSIC researcher of the Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that difference the age for women to marry and to have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of level, the greater the age at marriage and who have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, which have elementary and higher school have been mothers for the first time to the middle of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"Further also another division between women depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary school, marry and have their first child before getting a job stable, the average levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to ensuring a stable employment as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child child, detailing Delgado.

Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age walking by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent with her and our dog, a copy of race race, rescued the perrera and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, beat two kicks that left the dog Malherido.
Our indignation is glaring because there find the fun in a wanton aggression to a small animal and defenceless, which incidentally, was tied.
Add to this the suffocating that led to a lady who was passing by and that, when lashed out these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a madman energúmeno attacks an animal, it is able to do the so with a woman, a child, an old man, or, in short, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident happened at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday either by a traditionally quiet neighbourhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we made a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that fits much and not to generate sensitivities, just to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider funny defenceless free of charge to a defenceless animal that we give love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where they have been good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the mainly among younger motorcyclists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the case of an accident while circulating in motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond design and manufacture products every day more secure" and stated that also contributes to this goal through other actions of educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of hull in the motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be', will have a first phase in will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycles, with the goal of maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern "for the company, as being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop products increasingly safe.
Climb the sale of light commercial
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that were enrolled in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of Anfac manufacturers and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, not osbtante, it should be put in quarantine because the reference that makes the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a drop of 60% over the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the resurgence of the last month, enrolment accumulated in these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the hotchpotch of the light commercial: Derived from cars, pick up, pickup trucks, vans and light trucks belonging / lightweight chassis.
Also, have not gone away the clouds that most affect their demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So that the restrictions that the tap for bank loans, is in addition to other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Against this background and unlike cars, have been of little help aid to the purchase of the
To them eligible, in addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that to acquire a commercial slight of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testimony.
Yesterday, since Ganvam returned to recall the need to devote special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (lorries and buses).
The association of sellers predicts a similar to the year that has for which estimated a fall in sales (cars and 4x4s) of 19 per cent.
The emergency brake assist is already mandatory
As happened with the anti-lock of ABS brakes and will about with the control stability control, brake assist systems of emergency will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of while the rest is set for a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians while on his way to work, it can also help prevent many collisions by scope.
The assistant to the emergency brake what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, the system detects by the pisotón that gives the driver.
But this does not always maintains that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use any force.
Until 1,100 accidents
The intervention of aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum the brake system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided year up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which are involved pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one of every four claims be avoided with damage to popularize - when the so-called intelligent emergency brake system.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a house) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it fails to react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises maximum effort to the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the day 8 probably according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What to Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may make the final document will be put to workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, delayed until early 2010.
In contrast, since GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admitted having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but gains strength the option of Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to China Baic.
It the decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For Desarrolar last last, and expensive gem, engineers took the Porsche Boxster S as a basis and managed adelgazase nothing less than 80 kg, which has left the báscula in only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to dispense, firstly, the ceiling has been for whom one of tarpaulin with manual, thereby save 21 kilos; using aluminium doors as the GT3, 'are' other 15; taking away the Climatizador, 13; reducing the fuel tank of 64 54 litres, won 7 kilograms more; sports bacquets other 12 and with the tyres light of 19 inches, five.
Finally, to renounce the audio system DRC-30 contributed provided other six kilograms and changing the gunmen of the doors for a question, the remaining kilo.
But it also offers to change KDP double the test was carried out on a unit with the box of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads in California, in stretches of mountain with routes really revirados
Their behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
The weight does not mean that the car not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: not long testábamos Testábamos a model so small and light that, in turn, transmit so security in the curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the time necessary, until he get that Esprinte, which slow, to recover and return to squeeze its engine...
What I ask you to your leadership, as forthcoming as accurate, what we share with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
Sound of the engine will
The sound of his V6 V6, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and could be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already started earlier in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm but not harsh or inconvenient.
The asphalt roads that we are experiencing with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car Digirió the potholes.
Electronic aid barely did act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves are ice at dawn and chip already late in the morning.
In short, a car ultra the more fun to drive that you can in the market and that is something more than a simple amendment to the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

The Labour Fund achieved a brilliant triumph by 82-91 during his visit to the complicated of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties with which had the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way is in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple noted was the best of his team (29 assessment).
The team was able to fill the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, gardens or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work but had to suffer until the end to secure the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triple annotated had much to do in the final triumph.
The party began looking for the Azulgranas, which were made from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the vitorianos were from the perimeter was presage that had come to the Israeli court with his wrists hot..
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavés opted for the game inside Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pitos and applause in the return to that outside his home, to continue to expand its advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic already started to excel as the best of his team with 13 points, while the 'least six' assessment of Splitter already raised presage that this was going to be the best night of Brazilian.
But the party, despite being on track to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabim wanted to remind the vitorianos that in its scope does not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elias' tightening managed to in the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellow' return to the bright (50-49).
More disadvantages
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to a couple of games right for breath, and in these came the machine gun of Teletovic, with three consecutive almost triple and the help of English and Ribas returned the scoreboard to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to disguise the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaveses Alaveses came to be the skin in the latest partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already warned that they were not going to let anyone take what had been received during the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of his team is not resigned and tried to keep alive his team from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed Ivanovic was not precipitated, defended well, and although the Israelis came in the final minute (80-85), the party was already owner and the victory was from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.

The team malagueño Malagueño not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship and not by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful of Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed to dream of the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three consecutive triple, two of the basis Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio, dazzled the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the premises in the game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him return to the scoreboard 22-20, minute 13, at which an action, of wrangling between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, was the disqualification of both players.
The whole Greek began to show their superiority in both areas, where the low by injury of the English Joel Freeland and three personal misconduct of Carlos Jiménez, were the Cajistas.
Among the players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleizas, with its triple, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An increase impossible
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, that spite of the 19 losses, was higher and even as to match the difference of meeting disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which was the leadership of the group.
The Unicaja trying to overcome the absences and to the last of the Scottish pívot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the disadvantages the Unicaja by the management and the triple of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when clutching and given their superiority in centimetres inside the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to overcome the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja are snuffed handing the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil is date at the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has since run to the permanence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation later than 27 January 2010 2010, when his term officially its
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazil's embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where a refugee from 21 September.

Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring in the inflation of assets has been the dominant tone in the markets, new uncertainty again to reappear in the markets, which is not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the players take decisions on the future nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions to assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually completed and, without questioning its heterodox policy of liquidity, begin to throw some sand in the wheels how did the ECB with its auction to year of next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to the economic recovery without measures as heterodox and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have returned to rebound, although still far removed from the levels Paranormales that reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalise risk private and public debt returns to be affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge elected by investors, leading to an extension of the of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had been affected by this episode of instability but in that arrived Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the characterization of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of the moral hazard that trying again to create awareness on those responsible for global economic policy for have stopped the destructive effects arising from the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is to order a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, of Dubai pint in a tribal fight between the emirs to reshape the power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new government that is pulling the wraps.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin Salvase Hungary of a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a member country of the euro to breached its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and responsibility to its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, how we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expected.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt spreads extended like the European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European differential falling and our continue to expand, then it would be risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate their scenarios of recovery and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not much very life expectancy to his warning.
Again, it is the whole pint will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver".

The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since she was born in 1992.

The last four are embolsarán 4 million each.
The champion won 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in the concept of fixed payments, a club will at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça the other pocketed 2.5 million by winning the Supercopa of Europe in August.
But it is also are variable payments, which are intended 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is the main, and has four seats allocated.
The champion the previous year falls with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth quarter.

In these days of temporary and accidents, not only earn the workshops of cars.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert to assess the damage and what will the cost of repair.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of labour can be a long and complicated.
Calcularmanualmente the cost of compensation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces ymano labour, can take two or three hours.

As soon as a new car goes to the market, these companies are put to work.
It is a very hard work, because we must to each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, each model is a graphic portrayal "intelligent" where they can "tap" different parts of tourism.
If it is a model of Ventamasiva, the work can be completed in a week if the process is very fast.

Audatex invested EUR 90 million per year in drafting these databases.
Each month include 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.

Budget of workshop in four steps
With the tool Auda-taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in only four steps: identify the vehicle, looking for a replacement, create budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an essential prerequisite for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, we need to use a computer with Internet to the Internet.
Once identified the model to repair through its chassis number, appears a graphic portrayal of real model in question and then you select the parts necessary.
The user can include variables such as the price of labour, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to hand to the customer.
Audataller is not a tool of assessment as Audaplus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the the workshop does not include estimated times of labour.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, that the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to ensure that these images are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics view very favourably, as it will enable, for example, select a door and turn to see the side home.
