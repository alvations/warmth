USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, like a schoolgirl with a brownie Barack Obama, President with a reputation nejchytřejšího, repeating the question in the Afghan strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered it nejhloupějšího.
When finally vypotil his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that it copied over kopírák of Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself uses the word several times turnover as in Iraq, "but did not hesitate even to use the name of Bush's declaration in January 2007 as the name of their own declaration:" The new way forward ".
However, he was three years ago, criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, beset by civil war as "irresponsible and disastrous consequences of their decisions."
Subsequent months have shown that Bush's strategy based on the advice of field commanders was the only possible and veleúspěšnou so that today in the intelligence about Iraq at all levels from talking.
Bush's reputation nevylepšilo, but objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting point than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama in hopes that a miracle again.
The increase military contingent asked him again a field commanders, in particular the supreme commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, which even despite subordinačním harshly criticized the practice hesitant shooter in the White House.
Demanded 40 thousand men in order to break situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better accrue, so at least fool the general 10 thousand soldiers.
In fact, Europe was able to wring out the promise of another 5 thousand, though he initially counted at least the 10th
Most problematic for the whole Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawals of troops from Afghanistan as fast as 18 months and terminate the process within three years. Obama's whole doctrine raises more questions than provide answers.
Many doubt that the increase in half-baked fruit gives the same procedure as in Iraq.
Despite the internecine wars of recent years is the Iraqi society relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - the one shall not count and no agreements have not been honored.
Poorly under these conditions, prepare the Afghan security forces used as day to day depending on the Lord, as it suits them.
Political institutions, even though they are formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village, for they will continue to fester patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to clutter ratios, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Neither the establishment of a "akceschopného state", a minimalist objective throughout the operation, does not look too realistic.
Timing of Obama's strategy strikes his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation has only worsened in Afghanistan and is now on the verge of explosion.
Believe in that sending soldiers into a war in order to 'return home early' cause there made a miracle, can only truly romantic soul, the fact untouched.
From a political point of view, setting a date for withdrawal sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban would be seen as an implicit declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing minus.
European politicians can not and do not want to explain to voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervene in the situation developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and intensify the sanctions on the Iranians do not do, there will be before the United States burdensome question of whether not to try to resolve the problem of military force.
Answer it will be just the time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to download the winner of Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only patches for Barack Obama, the fact that the presidential election three years left, and thus remains still enough time to be able to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop.

Janota Minister is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus on Friday morning, take the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering staying in the government, as opposed to shape the state budget for next year as agreed in the center of the Chamber of Deputies.
It is expected that the budget and possibly Janotová remain in the cabinet are topics of their Friday meeting.
Budget has also been criticized Klaus.
He said the excessive deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting informed the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
About his next term of office wants Janota deal on Monday with Prime Minister John Fischer.
Under the budget, which now gets the signature Klaus, the Czech Republic has a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
But the House on Wednesday approved proposals to the Left movements of money and the money to increase salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the Social Democrats proposed that secretly inflate the budget deficit.
Between one and left the government, Klaus and his right hand on the other hand because of sharp internal political dispute arose, for which it begins to raise a question mark over the additional exposure Fischer bureaucratic cabinet in which to forge the spring agreed ODS, the Social Democrats and the Greens.
Critics contend that the budget as he accepted the House, basically destroyed the package saving measures that Fischer's government pushed through the autumn and which has stopped in its state debt.
Klaus, a law on the state budget may or may not sign on today's breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs said that politicians have neglected for a long time "serious problem" that is "unsustainable deficitnost" of public finances.
Today, he said he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could bring only a strong government that would also be able to rely on broad consensus of political parties, said the president.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is awesome and the government should consider further existence.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas told CTK that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green was clearly not working.
Prime Minister Fischer called in response to such words as "strong statements".
Paroubek Jiří Paroubek to Topolanek reacted by saying that the budget deficit is awesome that former Topolanek's government prepares for this year, which exceeds 200 billion.
On Wednesday identified the CSSD approval of the state budget for next year a success.

Mandela to the novelty of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman played
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: undefeated world denounced much of the country, about her struggle and victory, despite some criticisms that the main role played by American actors.
The story tells of the sport, racial proportions and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is the Oscar-winning U.S. actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he jednadevadesátiletý Mandela asked him whether, in Eastwood's film to externalize.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I told him: 'If you'll play, I will need to have access.
Dvaasedmdesátiletý actor who won an award for his role in an environment of Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, was portrayed as the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which eventually became a slave, a fictional U.S. president and even the god of the Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and for many people as important as Mandela.
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
The freedom of the redundancies in 1990 and four years, then became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel prize for peace.
Invictus is Latin for undefeated and is the name of an English poem by William Ernest Henleyho released in 1875.
The challenge was to speak as he
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains of apartheid are still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so decided to unify rugby players who are on a global scale between the outsiders.
The South African team eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years on how to get Mandelův story on the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role so I approached it the most realistic, "said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course, to speak like him.
Player said that if he and world politics were of the same area, tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be backstage before his speech.
The most important was that he wanted Mandela to shake his hand.
I found that when you pressed a hand assume your energy is transmitted, and I feel that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon in the film played by Francois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, which prevailed in the white players.
Player said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard world of rugby.
Big surprise for him then was when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember I rang the doorbell, he opened up to me and the first thing I Francois Pienaar in his life he said was: 'In the film look much more'.
Despite the clear differences in the characters of the actors in comparison to their real masters under the direction Eastwood won Invictus: undefeated positive reviews and speak as well as ambitions for an Oscar.
Sheet film critic Todd McCarthy Daily Variety summed up his evaluation by the words: "It was a very good story, very well-made film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus won 76 percent positive rating.
Mystery lights over Norway decipher: the Russians tested a missile
Over Norway to observe a special lighting effect of unknown origin.
Russian Defense Ministry yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Start again but was unsuccessful and the missile known as type "Bulava", which was originally the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black moth Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Neither his repeated presence at the missile tests had successful test flights at the appropriate effect.
Bulava most ever took off or damaged in the air.
The Russian newspaper was the "Bulava" writes as a "rocket, which can not fly."
Missile, which can not fly but shines
This in turn was the 13th experiment was conducted initially normal.
Until the end of the flight was again damaged technical apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third stage rocket.
Time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which floated beneath the surface of the White Sea.
This type allows the firing of rockets from the ship, which is in motion while submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway due to unspecified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians from the first moment he had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals this time prevents a claim that can not speak clearly a failure.
The first two stages the Rockets survived a hit to third accident.
In previous cases, the engines broke down right in the first instance.
Although completely flawless or may not have been a test start, the failed leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers that only six of thirteen.
Almost fifty percent success rate so filled with optimism and generals and still maintains that the "Bulava" would one day fly without problems and even hypersonických can carry up to ten nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed in 51 years, one-year contract at CSKA Moscow

Hyundai unions upheld. Cancels all overtime
Management Nosovice Hyundai car with the unions agreed to abolish all overtime.
It is because often nařizovaným overtime on Monday announced a union strike alert.
Confirmed car Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek.
Management, however, wants to trade union leaders to agree even on a Saturday this year's shift.
We can not waver in our production schedule, that is essential, therefore, was designed voluntary overtime Saturday, the 19th December with that would do double shifts, "said Vanek.
Server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company employees who worked the Saturday shift, offered a bonus of CZK 400.
He will get people back to work and Saturday, the 28th November.
The company, according to Vanek decided to change the way to motivate employees in the proposed overtime.
Either you leave to pay extra for overtime or compensatory time off may choose 28th December, and thus about the day to extend the Christmas holidays, said Vanek.
In addition, all employees get paid for Saturday shift and lunch fare.
Given that overtime was nejurgentnějším and most distressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, protesters and employees last week spontaneously stopped production, the lead yesterday afternoon, decided immediately to cancel any overtime for the month of December, said Vanek.
Staff car until last week were forced to practice every day to work eight-hour shift, even two-hour overtime.
After the signing of union strike alert recall
Further negotiations between management and trade union car is to take place on Friday morning.
Union boss Peter Cook on Wednesday said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document to be prepared to cancel the strike call.

Czech discovery: a substance that takes on 'hardy' HIV virus
A team of Czech and German researchers testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved compounds is that it takes to viruses that have acquired immunity against drugs.
This fact, in some cases outweigh the fact that the compound is a normal variant of "not so strongly as some already available drug.
AIDS can not yet be cured.
Patients may significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that inhibit reproduction of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus multiplication has also resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which the medication was ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences, Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with resistance to the virus.
Proved that a substance called metalokarborany acts on a protein responsible for the reproduction of HIV.
Metalokarborany are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus than any other currently used drugs, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work, scientists have come with the new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalokarborany a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages formed by atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked metal, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease cleavage caused by the HIV virus would not have been mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which then systematically altered.
A slightly weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti HIV protease was tested in vitro and also against the resistant (resistant) variants derived from patients infected with HIV.
Effect metalokarboranů a normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as the clinically used drugs, but does not lose its effect on drug-resistant variants against which drugs are used often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications of the metalokarboranů is interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Řezáčová, Head of Laboratory Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences.
Argument for the budget. ODS began to Fischer, he resists
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek described the approved budget for next year as "awesome" and the government of Prime Minister John Fischer should be considered in his continued existence.
Expression of ODS named prime minister with strong statements.
It leaves you said the time for analysis.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the CSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly not working.
The Prime Minister, according Nečase must decide whether it intends to rely on the House minority, which regards the fight against growing deficits, and he wants to stay in office through the parliamentary Left.
Access ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is a fundamentally different, pointed Necas.
The House on Wednesday adopted the 2010 budget, but with leftist amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased the money for salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
Damning criticism of the government proposals to address social democracy, while that secretly inflate the budget deficit.
CR should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote, left the hall, meet the wishes of the government that the amended budget is less bad thing than a financial temporary solution.
Frustration and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the Government assess the current situation even more.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened departure from office, if adopted amendments, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech television Janota ordered on Monday after the government of Prime Minister.
He indicated at that time when considering a further term of office.
Because of its disappointment at the hearing on the budget.
If Fischer is willing to continue the fight the budget deficit, not Necas said the government what to do nominanti Social Democrats, who pushed through changes in the budget.
Prime Minister should also clearly say that he would resign if the House approves further legislation increasing the deficit, such as those relating to sick leave, pensions, or an amendment to the Staff of Law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated ODS guilty
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated ODS done nothing wrong, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the U.S..
He recalled that several ministries are náměstkovských features people claiming to be the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas pointed out that if Fischer decides to relinquish the principle of fighting with the amount of deficit, "is absolutely logical and correct, relying on left-wing majority, which is currently in the House."
He said but can not count on support from Democrats and civil tolerance.
I did not think about it, and when it is current, so it will take, told reporters in the House Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was nominated by the Government of the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon left for the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of Prime Minister withdrew ODS
Necas also stressed that the ODS would be on Wednesday in the House apparently voted against the budget amended, if the Prime Minister Members of the Civic Democrats explicitly requested to ensure that the adoption of the budget allow.
I do not feel like orphans, we are small children, responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget netížila absence of the President in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my voice was missing.
Even when I was giving up the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months will mainly bolševizaci House and destruction of everything positive, he responded Topolanek.
Under the new procedure will take less CD for almost the same train fares
Czech Railways from 13 December revoke or limit some of the less busy local train express trains and other connections will strengthen the contrary.
Overall level of traffic from the date when the new timetable is reduced in comparison with today about two percent.
Most fares, including fares and customer base will not change.
More options related to the capital gain as the inhabitants of Ostrava, the tracks on this track adds a Pendolino trains.
Contrast, high-speed train ride stops in Bratislava.
Fewer trains will go well on the route Prague - Pisek - Czech Budejovice, significantly limiting the direct connections Praha - Letohrad.
The regional plan to track the largest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové region, a total of eight percent increase on the other hand, may enjoy Prague.
Removes the two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - Czech Budejovice and operation of several trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Czech Budejovice is limited to certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of new direct flights to Prague from Milovice today Milovičtí have to change trains in Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of suburban Esko, the opening is made possible by the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance services in the capital will terminate at the destination station Prague Main Railway Station.
CD introduce more SC Pendolino trains between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka / Jeseníku will go at two-hourly intervals.
Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December was a passenger ride.
This year's bill for the regional rail: 200 million more
Fast trains ordered and paid the Ministry of Transport, were called to cover the loss can be proven runways next year, four billion crowns, as well as this year. Local ordering region, total pay for them next year, eight billion crowns, while almost three billion edges will become.
This year, the regional trains of 200 million more expensive.
The local train and express trains have recently concluded a ten-year rail contract, the contract has always been for one year.
Railways have praised the system, because obviously resorting to any increase in the vast majority of tickets.
The changes occur only in day-Network CD Net tickets and cheap tickets online eLiška.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net increase of 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
Price eLiška will now depend on the distance traveled, yet was for regional travel between any cities uniform and was 160 crowns.

The story of South Africa is affecting everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next coming days in American cinema a new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech added Invictus: undefeated), which depicts the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of world-renowned fighter against apartheid has been undertaken by Morgan Freeman, whom he said for his rendition of years ago he chose Mandela.
The secondary roles of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar has been undertaken by Matt Damon.
With the film in cinemas arising from critics and the public feedback
Nelson Mandela
His full name Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela was born on 18th July 1918 in South Africa Mvezu.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he and de Klerk Nobel Peace Prize.
President of South Africa was in the years 1994-1999.
high expectations as the public comes at a time when South Africa first peak to the world football championship, while the media lightly disturbing reports of increasing racial hatred and discrimination against black people by the ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency reviews the new film in South Africa being largely positive, despite the numerous objections to fill key roles "profláklými" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, by its words on the new film proud.
About the role I had dreamed for many years and are well prepared for it.
Many times I have also personally met with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - drew its energy, said in an interview after the gala premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it is good if we can film recalled Mandela's personality and message.
It is the story of South Africa, but concerns everyone, he said.

Table on the lawn in the jersey, which is in South Africa seen as something almost sacred, harvested Mandela fourteen years ago a great ovation mostly Caucasian audience and gained recognition Caucasian population.
Football Championship hopefully people can reconnect in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the 1995 single "black" in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
White South Africans are skeptical, as ku example in a recent interview told the LN rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
Championship starts 11th June 2010.
On Louny transformer fire for tens of millions of crowns
Morning fire engulfed a transformer substation in the company Cepsa in the village Výškov Louny.
The fire extends by the regional fire brigade spokesman Usti Luke Marwan six units.
Originally firefighters wanted to leave the transformer burn out, but later re-evaluate the view and the fire extinguishes a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was technical failure, an internal short circuit transformer.

Supplies of electricity were not under the company ČEZ spokesman for North Bohemia Soni Holingerové Hendrychová disrupted the functioning of households, offices or businesses did not affect the fire substation.
As Cepsa operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.

Jančura lodges complaint for defamation of three captains of the CSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura now submit complaint for defamation of three social-democratic presidents.

Action related to the company trying to operate a regional train services in some regions.
All regions but eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways.
All three governors of the attacks against us and talk about that you choose raisins, while we brought the offer only what they wanted.
Claims that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the price of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend.
It is a slander against the company Student Agency, said Radiožurnál Jančura.
It also stated that the evidence from all regions failing their actions in line with European law.
Therefore, the initiative is preparing for the European Commission.
Hasek filing a complaint considers the continuation of Mr. Jančura media show, which he serves as its unpaid advertising company and his own people.
I am of course prepared to defend their good name and my county and do the same challenge as other captains.
I suppose that even on this occasion clearly indicates that it was Mr. Jančura who on regional rail transport handles public and used false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jančura was announced last week that it is investing several million in advertising that will be disadvantaged regions highlighting step.
Radiožurnál said that the campaign after Christmas and stay in it wants to continue after the New Year.
Stated that the campaign will be waged against corruption as such.
Jančura campaign began after the county agreed to the operation of regional rail links with Czech Railways and custom around 150 billion nevypsaly tenders.
According Jančura similar illegal conduct in contravention of the European Court of Justice.
Because of criticism of train traffic in the regions already Jančura he said threatened the deputy for the Social Democrats.
The only threat was that if you do not let it, so we can come on the bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know that the Lord is, say his name, said today Radiožurnál Jančura.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal January rooted habits and break down.
To be the first for the family as well as free optional.
But we do not reverberating voices, it would be mandatory vaccination more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peak.
Pharmaceutical Institute has set a maximum price of vaccines, which pays health insurance.
Experts have also have clear procedures for vaccination.
New vaccine
Free vaccines for children in August
From January may be free vaccination against pneumococcal children who were born last year 2nd August and later.
Condition is that still did not get even one dose of vaccine.
Who started the vaccinations last year or earlier must himself pay the additional booster.
The first dose of vaccination must be made between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against pneumococcal fourth families.
Parents while paying 1600 crowns per dose or more.
Youngest child for vaccination with four doses are needed.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies to get on the vaccine dose of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
Saves but treatment that children without vaccination needed.
Not worth all the area vaccination of children gave about 500 thousand a year.
Reimbursements vaccination was introduced so-called Janotovým package.
Pneumococcal causing middle ear infections, but severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infection in our country per year die in hospitals under investigation to 28 children under 10 years.
Addition to the Czech Republic introduced a paid area of children against pneumococcal vaccination in approximately 40 countries.
Will vaccination compulsory?
At the same time but there are views that the future could be the vaccination mandatory.
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
It would be better to vaccination, indicated as the head of the civic association Unmute Rudolf Kalovský.
His long association promotes pneumococcal vaccine.
Experts at the international conference that our association took part, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It is not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that at least managed to push through this.
I think that is the way that we need to start now, said Kalovský.
Ministry of Health but the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcal want to change.
At the moment about not consider at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctor
Chair of Professional practice paediatricians Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of booster "In situations where this vaccine is the high amount is quite understand the political decision that vaccination was started as a voluntary," but said Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that their infants be immunized against pneumococcal from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is a breakthrough even that it was the first area vaccination of children borne by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should be spending money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy yourself substance
But with the practical concerns related to children's doctors regarding purchasing vaccines.
According to the original intent of the vaccine should buy insurance and doctors would receive just as they become available substance to other vaccinations.
Some members, however, feared that this would mean that insurance companies "to transfer the money from health insurance.
Physicians will therefore need to buy the substance and wait for them to reimburse insurance companies.
According to estimates, the individual child physician practitioners to invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on building minarets and is generally spread scare stories about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed, and thought about the fact that Muslims can integrate them - and whether to integrate - in one of most open secular societies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French do not like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and discussed a study on the contentious issues that divide a country already employ for 15 years and whose effects are felt still today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious scope.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now taking care of 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen called 'Islamic areas'.
Is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues that most concern.
A Muslim should enter into marriage in a mosque or a hall (or both)?
Should be taught by a young Muslim on the evolution and gay rights?
A Muslim can marry a man who is not Muslim?
Muslim has the right to use areas of interest-based banking system wants to get a mortgage?
These are the seemingly mundane controversial issues are discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than the political dramas that employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known people, including the Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion on how you can simultaneously be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have arguments for all their custom.
Conservatives are suspicious of the actual idei French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen conducted interviews, tend to doměnce that is a counterpart Selafiho-purist Sunni supporters of Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia-this group is small, but also affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
Wonders how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who doggedly defended the general public) is really committed to the idea of pluralism.
It believes that Muslims in matters of faith are likely to experience less than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republikánstvím.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found "screws values."
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, anyone can be prone to say "Yes, but not now."

Ironic is that this takes place in water to the north pole of the two nations and the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "The Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, has a clear responsibility of the dismal science in the Arctic and interesting glimpse of how it can change the future.
Not at all, researchers reply.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.

Anti-graffiti and speech are considered serious offenses.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by a popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about as she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country in order to receive the prizes, but it was refused permission.
Detention of American suppliers may be the result of growing tensions between the communist Castro's brother, reigning in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was monitored as a "delaying tactic" to improve relations with the island.
The first report on the imprisonment of New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government has taken concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, the United States take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodity in a country where the average civil servant's salary is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government gave ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just in this year they are used mostly PRPO textovýchg send messages as 15-minute phone call would cost more than a daily wage.
Use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.

Pakistani civil servants rozkrývají conspiracy relating to the posting of men in Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday detected the alleged leader of a conspiracy relating to the deployment of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan, where the killing of U.S. troops and said they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of crimp terrorists who prowls the Internet and looks radicalized young men.
Investigators said they searched the gray rebel personality, known as Saifullah, who invited the men into Pakistan after it first appeared, when one of these men published a commentary officer terristické attack, internet videostránce YouTube.
Saifilláh took over leadership of these men when they came to Pakistan, tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the Pakistan zone of the indigenous tribes, which is home to al-Qaida and its training camps for terrorists.
But Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in reconnaissance commanders of al-Qaida and the men were part of the CIA trying to infiltrate terrorist networks.
Consequently, they were dropped off for a few days to the eastern district Sarghoda, far from threatening the mountains in the northwest, which have become havens for terrorists.
Were considered as shock troops.
This is why they were dropped, said the official, who spoke about preserving anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not deterred and still trying to obtain consent to gain access to the camps of al-Qaeda, were arrested when Pakistani power law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and was questioned FBI - emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, determine who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001 the U.S. Secret Service attaches the highest priority on the location of attempted human resources to al-Qaeda.
Recruiters organizations function as a guard, eliminating those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
American recruits were subjected to false for al-Qaeda specific aspects, said analysts.
But they were also regarded as extremely interesting group, because, given their access to potential U.S. targets, and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the U.S., said that terrorist groups will also become in recent years, much more cautious in that kohu allow approached them, because U.S. intelligence agencies received experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow the recruitment model, which has been pursued so? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those, which is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, called climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday to demand stronger action on climate negotiators from Congress in the city center of Bella.
Protesters reported the number of many thousands of participants in this event, but the police odnaduje that the number was closer 25000th
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists put several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day when the minor incident occurred in the talks on climate change, sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the town, carrying banners with the English inscription "This is not a planet B" (ie, secondary) and one in španěltštině that proclaimed "Land says 'enough' .
Protest attended several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, said that she traveled to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and provide me information about the bleak state of the country, which contributes to the impact of climate change, which still occurs.
This is part of the reason why we decided to join the great march - walk the world and appealing to world leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
Not an easy task, but it must be carried out, it still can not be avoided.
Police prevented protesters to converge toward the center of Bella and stated that it arrested 19 persons, primarily because they either deployed or masks or carry a pocket knife.
These activities are under Danish law during demonstrations banned.
According to one of the bystanders who did not wish to be identified because it is involved in rohovorů climate activists disguised as athletes, and black coats and put several bombs near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
Lobbied for buildings, said zahajivali flares, but followed by "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But the protest is likely to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, chief negotiator of China's climate.
When asked whether it should nevertheless be demonstrations constructive impact on international negotiations, said English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (actually it's something you do not realize).
He continued čínčtině and said, "Because the venue is large, I can not hear what's going on outside.
Monitor whether the march of pain or helpful, depending on the outlook for each.
You can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "We can also say that it is a distortion of the hearing or the freedom of others.
Test data revealed a constant persistent racial disparities
Federal certification of last week on the progress of mathematics knowledge was a welcome element of good news for public school district Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate showed more progress for pupils in fourth and eighth classes for the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest issue of the National Center for attestation progress in teaching is the persistence of differences in knowledge achieved between African Americans and white students and both the local site, as well as the national site.
The average result of white students of fourth-class county Columbia for the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of possible 500), but their African American peers were nrůstu only three points from 209, on 212th
The difference in the obtained knowledge has increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress for African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant decline of one point of 245 to 245th
The average results for white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Image in term of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils in fourth class in 2003, when the NAEP was first performed in the district was 60 points scale (262 ku 202).
Although the result achieved in children oboi groups improved during this period, the difference barely approached the 58th
Some advocates of education in the district in the last week say that the results, celebrated secretary Michelle A. Rheeovou and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) for white students were stimulated to a greater extent where the results have been high.
That would be hinting that we have increased the amount of support at the higher end of the scale, which is troubling and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality vdělávání in the district.
Neskáču up and down due to the scattering of two or three points, "said committee member DC Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticize the style of management Rheeové Mrs., Ms. Brown said that the reports on the test results indicates a medium of education in the city is in desperate condition and needs attention.
It is clear that we always want to see the pros and I respect that.
But what is horrible that we did not pay almost no time and energy that was needed to pay our secondary education.
Mrs. Rheeová said that the effort is a continuation of the district searching for better ways of addressing the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in higher grades of primary school and high school students who failed to master the fundamentals of reading earlier in their school kariéřea significantly lag behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics curriculum and teaching mathematics in sixth grade, emphasizing the games and real life experiences, which have been in the district under former manager Clifford Janeyiho, can be attributed to progress NAEP, which was the subject of a report last week.
And just think that we should continue to work and implement the best interventions for those students who remain below grade, "said Mrs. Rheeová.
Others said that the results of NAEP clarify whether Mrs. Rheeová may continue svyšování overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for schools with poor performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a strong dilemma Rheeové Ms. Michell said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, where student test scores in urban areas.
The conventional approach is to focus correction means and administrative reforms to schools located in the worst parts of the district Columbia.
This can bring the focus of political repercussions, which is directed against the relevant agenda.
But the complaint but also includes other city managers who are trying to keep the mean diameter between white and black.
We must focus on building a system of large schools.
We must cement a relationship of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be given an excellent public schooling.
Mr. Janey, now director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element in reducing the difference between the results obtained is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to place the validity of schools.
You must get up to 200 days, you can push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded an association agreement with its teachers last school year, from 185 days, which is considered a "flag" to search for more increases next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
Tour bus pulled into the track Gettysburgské loud oddychováním.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got out and rested for a moment the white pillars, brick facades and emerald green grass ..
Gracielini parents barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Yet Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the land track.
Now she and other eighth grade students in a group exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $ 38,690 a year, their position was more than discouraged potential visitors enthusiastic students.
Yes! That's it! Graciela said that would be like studying medicine, when a speaker has offered to enter into the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when they revealed a low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven who visited on their three-day tour and were now fully occupied with the future message: The question is not whether to enter college.
The question is where.
But this is a problem in supporting the large number of U.S. born children of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from their universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of those who receive a college education and enter the middle class.
In fact this fifth "Duhem generation of Spanish students from college - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and people of Central America, arrive in the United States without having completed high school.
Their success story is important, researchers state, because it underlines the point the way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the field of labor of the country.
Those who have completed higher education reached say that they naturally náklonpost to school and innate assertiveness and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and seek ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play a special role in helping millions of children and Graciela, who would like undergone track - especially if these efforts continue over time.
If you take into account that children come from groups with low incomes, whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them norientovat in the system, free from any interference in each point is resolved, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, where she studied students from Latin American area.
We have to think that we provide these safety net for children of preschool age in all the ways that pročšly college.
The federal program that funded the trip graciela on rails, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (připtravit in), provides more than 300 million dollars annually for local school systems to start mural training programs, which begin for students from groups with little revenue for public schools and continue until such student has finished the high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil ministry has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Notwithstanding the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to bring major oil companies for the reconstruction of its infrastructure during the two sickly auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, ochromeného decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with equity participation just two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Lost by only one bid.
Two U.S. companies have reached agreements on the field, which was auctioned in June.
Modest participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry, surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the doors after six years of war and the American companies that have primarily in the way Asians and Europeans, "said Ruba Hussar, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It will be long before something else will be in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about safety, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military is likely to discourage U.S. companies from more intensive business activities in Iraq, which has the third largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
American companies have in some cases at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to taking risks, because they are not responsible to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc.. were the only U.S. companies that have signed agreements with the Ministry.
Leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil ministry and offer technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom are shareholders in the top two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of the week.
China National Petroleum National Corp. participated in the bids on more contracts than any other company and left with large stakes in two major contracts for the field.
We all know that China seeks to become a major economic as well as a technological power, said oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and to honor their commitments to Iraq.
Companies that have been provisionally selected for submission of tenders, which were then compared according to Ministry price of a barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the current output levels on each field.
Top planner of al-Qaida was apparently killed in Pakistan.
When the impact of U.S. missiles at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week was apparently killed a top planner of al-Qaida operations, as announced on Friday by officials of the U.S. counter-terrorism department.

They were directed to a white car, which points toward the Afghan border, when he was hit, said an official with the Pakistani intelligence agency cicilní a caller from Miran Shah.
The official said that local militants are swept to the point quickly zabavilito what was left of "totally destroyed bodies.
Local authorities were not able to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. officials have cited an unspecified anti-terrorist department of the witness, who said that the Somali poi death.
Somali has been cited as a senior planner of military operations, al-Qaeda, who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in zosnovávání throughout the world, said a senior official, who did not wish to be named, which featured the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If you held a central position, was probably involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe.
Received instruction from the senior management of Al-Qaeda and based on these planned terrorist attacks possible.
Another American official said that the Somali rapidly advanced in the hierarchy of al-Qaida and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
Not be well known person for some Americans, but that in no way neponižoval that before us and our allies posed, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, the Somali should be the second senior leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban who should be killed since September, when in a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, leader of the militant factions in Gaza tribes, and three other top leaders poperativní.
The pace of attacks launched by pilotless CIA aircraft has decreased since the summer from an average of approximately six transactions per month to two, according to Long War diary entries, web sites, managed by non-profit group.
Reduction may be the reason of improved tactics of terrorist groups to take action to reduce their vulnerability by the ruthless killing of persons who were suspected of being informers, said Page.
Senior UN envoy in Kabul resigned.
Senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he wanted from her to resign from his post in March and end the turbulent term, which was thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential elections in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
The Eide departure occurs because the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
UN Delegate said that he supported an increase, but expressed concern that the timetable for reducing U.S. state that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal Afgáncům that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Received commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
Increase of the other armed forces must be copied to other civilians, he said.
Eide said he resign, but that simply fulfills the promise he gave his family in March 2008, in Kabul, spent only two years.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now said that he needed time for a replacement.
As I said, it is time to look after the dauphin, "said Eide.
When I came here, there was a vacuum between the two-month leave of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to officials of the UN Ban began seeking compensation.
Officials said that the decision between Staffan di Mistura, who has a Swedish-Italian origin, and formerly led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhennem, Frenchman, who previously headed the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide situation in Afghanistan was tested after his former agent, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September, President Hamid Karzai, who won the presidential election on land masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide has denied those allegations, but said that the allegations Galgraitha - which was released - "definitely harm the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said that the proposed meeting with the chief representative of the citizens due to the coordination of relief efforts at keeping U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Also urgoval the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers in the United States and other Western countries, which could be borrowed for the Afghan mission, because, he says, wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of their efforts in Afghanistan and said that the heavy-handed regulation to hire undermine the UN's ability to use abilities.
UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get in May, only one person, he said.
This is a disaster and I can not continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose on Iran "further significant penalties" due to lack of engagement in the talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a weekly trip to areas where there is conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects of military action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to an inquiry by a soldier of the likely evolution. ¨
One of the things that depend on me, is that if I learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is an inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration decided on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "the package of incentives and barriers" would require "to persuade the Iranian government to actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "the people will suffer from an extremely 'sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion, issued by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration engaged European leaders in warning that Iran bear serious consequences if its nuclear program fails to comply fully with the UN nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop their expertise for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva 1st October indicated that he wanted to return to talks on reducing their nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of its stocks of enriched uranium in return for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
Administration has planted in such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran withdraws from the interim agreements - in part because, says the expert, because leadership is irámské is divided about whether to commit the United States.
Frankly, if the Iranian obstinacy to the international community for some suggestions, which are actually agreed in early October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on a path that is not the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians said Gates.
President Obama set for 31 December deadline for Iran to reply to the proposals before returning to search for other options, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had called "degrading penalties.
In the opinion, issued in New York, Iranian Mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what he called "unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations" against some members of the Security Committee of the Iranian nuclear activities and said that he wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an adequate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met this morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk, and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There remains a high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly due to boundaries, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to zabránlo delay U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop numbers from 115000 to 50000 to end of August.
Gates also sought to dampen concerns about Kurdish persistent depression. Official U.S. site quoted Gates, he told Massoud Barzáanímu, President kurdistánské regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
You do not want to leave. "
Aging in China, change course
Weijia Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which read that "Mother Earth is too tired to fund more children" and "One child also means a grave also.
Then came the lesson that when the official government positions in Shanghai, alarmed low birth rate and aging population in the city, suddenly changed course in the summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always spent all my time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for others, says Wang, 31 years old, manager of human resources, which has 8měsíčního son.
More than 30 years of China's policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations, only the notoriously boubelatých and zhýčkaných children affectedly dubbed "little emperors", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before vpolitika vsoupila force, according to UN figures.
Distribution of population, where the population aged 60 years or more are predicted to grow exuberantly 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. That is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and above were almost 22 percent of the population registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai municipal committee on population and family planning said, many couples have children, "to help reduce the proportion of aging population and reduce the numerical status of the workforce in the future."
He says it's about "being old, it does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden.
Gradual pacing
As has been inserted into the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
The pair, who violated the policy, face enormous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work.
Chinese official positions advocated policies that helped the country avoid a critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were sentenced to enforce policy.
In rural areas, some officials urged pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo a sexist selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials were progressively less severe in its opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, as a rule permit výce exceptions - including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and in cases where a man and woman were only child - and in 2007 to mitigate the diction of their passwords, promote a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing Institute of population research university, said that officials of the central government has previously debated radical changes such as allowing couples to have two children where one partner was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters urge parents to have only one child, replaced with copies thereof, describing in detail how it would be legitimate to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
Municipal Administration sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and vsouvali flyers under the door.
Also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cool, said officials for planning families.
Distressing response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai experienced an increase in the interest of couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban precincts were reported changes.
Huinan urban district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Frustrated officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births in 2010 is still expected to only about 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Juying Feng, head of the committee for family planning in Shanghai čtvti Caol said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she would like to have two children, and being legally allowed.
But like many Chinese who have only limited medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without dociální safety nets would be irresponsible choice.
People in the West consider the one child policy bad as the disputed legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in association with the first child.
Yes, we were cheated of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem lies not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples show the psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, manager of human resources, says that they want only one child, because she also was an only child: "We focus our families and all of us cared.
We were not used for the provision of care and in fact we did not want to worry about others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who vlatní translation company, has put much nepokrytěji.
For dvoukariérové middle-class parents, who lowered birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30 years growing up my parents is seen as a piercing, the first days číského experiment with capitalism and do not want this kind of a living for himself, he says.
Just one child places enormous demands on time parents, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of his social life.
Then there are disputed issues propstoru - "You have to rebuild your apartment" - a strategy - "You have a resume ready when the child is 9 months for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends wants to settle with one child, said Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says.
We do not want to bring too many victims.
UN task force outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
UN-sponsored conference on climate change - largely characterized neukázněnými attitudes and mutual osočováním - again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes ambitious greenhouse gas reduction over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the nearest time.
Text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on regulating greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizes the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But it was seen important progress in the negotiations which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week.
UN Working Group created an ad hoc, the text subtly indicates how much money rich countries should give those poor to cope with global warming in the short term and long term.
A provides a full range of options for key issues, including how to develop and manage the emerging economies in order to reduce their carbon output and what should be the upper limit global temperature increase, which will be policy makers can not tolerate.
This dodábá process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, Senior Washington Representative of Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested six pages document abridgement of the 180 pages of text for the meeting to focus on what a top official on climate issues at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "big picture".
Outlines the contours of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations could collectively reduce their emissions by 25 up to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries could their emissions during this period reduced to 15 to 30 percent.
Together the countries to cut emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union urgently discussed on Friday a promise to provide 3.6 trillion U.S. dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptation - from managing floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still Friday said the same type of verbal fireworks, which prevailed in the talks last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary for the main emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
Shift signaled that the Obama administration raised a harder line towards China, get outta officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States accedes to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and implementation of action, "said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to cover the limitations and should be examined by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the main U.S. negotiator on climate issues that either a lack of "common sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led to a week earlier in a statement that the United States would not help financially China to to cope with global warming.
With the future economic path of the main world powers at stake, a scramble broke out inside the developing world and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current fight is mostly about maintaining individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States on implementing their respective obligations, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the most influential countries in the world to ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of stronger action.
Ricardo ULAT, delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases while vulnerable countries became more aggressive in seeking to prevent the large issuers zak responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a play about the fact that new economic hegemony is developed, said ULAT, which also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné effects of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue enforce legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major parties, said that the best result of the talks is the political agreement.
Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created 24stránkový draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the promotion of the small island nations' political tlkak triggered the whole process polirtický "partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
Negotiations led to a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that they have solved most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of governments compete agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as the Indian Minister of environmental protection Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister spoke of the aircraft and ran through halls Bella Center to the closed door meetings and conferences of the new chart so they could claim to be examined next week.
Utter vastness Assembly - where 13,000 people a day moved along the convention center, the guitar playing activists staged at night ironic spectacle of the countries, which are believed to be sent, and there were proposals for the transfer from hand to hand on paper rather than electronically post - controlled challenge.
Intensity is only an extension: in Copenhagen were present almost all the key ministers and earlier Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We got into the high category, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for global policy for international nature conservation.

British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday redefined sensation
at 5:13 on Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the train, which meant a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras and beyond the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Kelly Holmes and got into the first high-speed passenger trains outside lLndýn.
He hopes that the new service or join the UK with an international network of fast, reliable trains, and connects large agglomerations Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Neglected backwater should shorten transport times in passenger traffic and trade routes and the transition from aircraft and rail cars would reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
Theoretically, the three main political parties had left to get to this vision.
But dozens of Bilin pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental insults now constrain the development of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a workable government study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis December 30, as stated Times.
She gave him a detailed route map for further stages planned high-speed network.
New trace connections with the West London Midland was nominated for five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods where dopat Environmental propstředí could be problematic.
In the open countryside was planned 25 m in the final route.
HS2 also expected to identify three broad options for high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis answers spring.
The preferred option is konfikurace Y-shaped, with one high-speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The track should share with one near the Birmingham branch, through the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that it was the most efficient choice," said a railway expert.
Once this is done, driving times between London and Edinburgh is reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first phase, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham for 49 minutes, compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to run at 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route has been proposed so as to carry trains on the length of 400 m, which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the route London - Birmingham.
Means that the London terminal would be able to serve, if necessary, to 20000 passengers per hour.
Due to capital constraints, assumed that the existing station would be expanded so as to accommodate high-speed network.
Experts from železničníhoprůmyslu argues that only San Pancras International and Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis announces that means or does not intend to implement this scheme, but the extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that KEC is not a final decision before the general election.
While indicating wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should be first put into service rather than high-speed lines, but the existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a crucial contact point for the transition from airplanes to trains, a landmark for the revolution to rail.
Taxpayers pay the mortgage of £ 75,000 on orangery Tory
Alan Duncan, chair-holders leading Tory benches in the House of Commons taxpayers pay the cost one thousand pounds last year for the orangery, which has built in his home in the electoral district.

Recent Documents municipalities show that Mr. Duncan continued to claim £ 1250 per month in May this year.

And I could claim the full share of the damned, but I will not. "
MP, the millionaire former career as a trader of crude oil, was first asked to explain its release in May, when it became clear that claimed one thousand pounds for your garden, before approving the tax authority that it "can be regarded as excessive."
One of the activists had dug a pit in the shape of the pound sign in the lawn of Mr. Duncan to protest after he revealed that a claimed 4000 pounds for three years.
When he was asked last night to increase the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: "It was the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax authority and then Legge."
He added: "It is not disputed question of hiding and dribbling or breaking the rules or something else.
Absolutely a straight line down the rules, justified, and that's all.
That would be nenohlo many other spůsoby cleaner and simpler.

Association UDF increases tone and calls side Nouveau Center to continue to not enjoying the shortcut.
Association of the UDF party controlled MoDemFrançoise Bayrou on Friday responded to an attempt by President Nouveau Center, Hervé Morin on appropriating shortcuts former Giscardovy Parties agree that the acronym may be used in any medium, under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to steal a shortcut with the UDF, François Bayrou that you deserve to bear the inheritance after his hand left.
Defense Minister, whose party is a partner of UMP, had planned the strategy to confirm the Saturday before the National Council Nouveau Movement Center (NC).
This step has the support of the MEP Hervé de Charetta (for ex-UMP is now in NC), who assigns ownership of the brand UDF because it first had in 2004 registered in the National Industrial Property Institute (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle ).
But on Friday evening, the committee managed by friends of the Association UDF François Bayrou, who do not intend to let expropriate, stepped out of his silence and gave a formal request by the Minister to stop using the acronym and handed back ownership of the mark, on pain of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, have increased concern about the statement that the design of its political movements to re-assume + + acronym UDF, says the Association in a letter signed by 19 of those 24 members of the Committee, which as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by modem or Senator Jean Arthuis Alliance of the Centrists.
At the same time you considered it appropriate to put on their promotional materials and on the welcome page of your website name + Nouveau movement, center +, with the slogan + + UDF today, note the signatories to the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, the committee said UDF seeking movements NC "immediately remove all references to the name of the UDF, including all promotional materials (their) website.
And asking Hervé de Charettea "that gave ownership of legitimate trade mark owners.
Otherwise, turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In his letter indicates that the UDF is a fully-fledged political hnutíod 1978 "and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends have" chosen "departure in 2007," to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002 to form UMP.
Nouveau movement center is not, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time point out that the last Congress UDF voted in 2007 to connect the modem to three years and to create a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" association created Valérym Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charettea, the committee continues, "when the registered trade mark", not "for three years a member of the UDF, but the UMP.
Scandalous and fraudulently used the absence of registration of acronyms to do so on their own account.
This indiscretion is starting to convert to a criminal offense, claim, and then the irony of the strategy denominated NC: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life is more valuable to create a name for himself than to withdraw from the anonymity of fraudulent adoption names which we have no right.

Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier be tried for abuse of state weakness.
The court in Nanterre on Friday decided to sue artist François-Marie Baniera and adjudge whether the state used the weakness of the Eighty Years miliardářky to prepare her for a part of its assets, which it blames her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
Photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of famous 15th will be judged and 16 April 2010 for misuse of state weakness, which is a criminal offense for which a sentence in a maximum of 3 years and a fine of 375 000.
This decision confirms that the process actually takes place in a case that can be characterized as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which each attack a mother and daughter struggling with the management of L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But 15th Criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which should make the College three doctors.
Heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not on the terms offered to the public prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation.
Physicians who will be elected on Friday, should produce a report to the 10th March 2010 and also requested to comment whether the Liliane Bettencourt could find in a state of weakness, and in which period.
I think that it undergoes.
The things to her speak, said after the hearing Mrs Bettencourt lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As the Attorney-Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's good news (...). Expertise shows that this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier) confirmed.
Are the two years since the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, which accused the state for years used her mother's weakness to gain the gift of one billion euros producing certified checks, contracts for life insurance or images League .
But Liliane Bettencourt always refused, it would be a photographer, which considers long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court must assess the legitimacy of an action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday court speech advocates are sometimes changed in the family hour of truth.
Attorney Liliane Bettencourt submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to your notaries, and in which it expressed its mistrust of the husband-Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, according to Liliane Bettencourt lawyer adds: "could you explain to my daughter, I wrote Banierovi for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Since that time she married, I could never speak Françoise.
State prosecutor in Nanterre again found that the complainant's conduct was not justified, the more that the guardianship judge in those days rejected its request to initiate proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully able to participate in the court is not under protection or in custody.
No one else for it not to act 'representative confirmed the prosecution, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
Finally, the Court held that the validity of Mrs. Bettencourt Meyers-expressed during the initiation process.
Managerial Revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was wasted ...
For more than ten years, recalls the behavior management of large company employees access to business-to-consumer marketing before the revolution: the point is to co-identify themselves with the "values" identified from the mountain, as it once was when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products which have emerged heads of the ideas factory technicians.
That the customer became a center of entrepreneurial companies, compare marketing strategies conquering the market revolution in the right direction ... even if the authoritarian attempts to impose on the products of different customer preferences, returning regularly!
Passive attitude of the staff can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in companies France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions, including research and development and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires all parties (...) active approach and ability to anticipate" and requires commitment from employees who are completely at odds with the authoritarian revenue management.
We therefore call on the managerial revolution, which was designed to bring workers to the center of interest of the company as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys.
Internal polls - as the reply submitted by the employees the company Orange - contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I convinced myself that in the face of new situation, the structure of the various branching priority returns to ... you always did!
Furthermore, because that authoritarianism as a pathology of power increases proportionately with the severity of their own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because graduates of engineers have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience of thought are acquired by the old behaviorist theory, now re-animated "neurosciences" in the U.S. and widely disseminated without greater knowledge of scientific institutes and the media.
In fact, it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey agency Ipsos Figaro.fr the site, which only strengthens the management personnel in the position of a mechanical procedure, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure factors mobilization.
Conversely, managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, provides the definitive vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of basic insight into all projects and management practices: The staff will make commitments to the firm is only when they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept, the motivation of employees engaged in the study only motivation functional analysis.
These studies showed that their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxy, which will allow them to use images, which the company says, look at what gives them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these factors, managers can mobilize to control, predict and pre-empted on their "social power", indicating their human resource management "on track".

Manifestation of the Oslo "just war" Obama has earned praise from the right.
American right-wingers on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before the Oslo satisfied with the fact that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 advocated the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.

I think that speech was really good, congratulated the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which especially appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world.
In a way, I thought the speech as fully historical, Gingrich said during an interview on radio program "The Takeaway".
A former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012, was thrilled to see "leftist president," noted committee members for the Nobel Prize, "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace, if the use of force exist.
According to Michael Gershon, a former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama gave a "very American expression.
Not only is presented as a "cosmopolitan" as always, but "speaking as an American President" and reminded Europeans that "they live in a safe bubble they created themselves and that they do too much for it to keep it" evaluated Gerson.
Among the few malcontents from the right is the hawk Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who has described as "dull, turgid and without inspiration," as stated on National Review Online.
The left of the President, as the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama to justify the use of force.
"When the war packed into a container of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, moderate-leftist press is of the opinion of the President of praise.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to award the Peace Prize Obama premature reviewed his output as "nadvýkon" and orator known for his talent.
Speech Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in resolving conflicts, the fight against poverty and oppression, "fervently states California newspaper.
Obama "speech that was said to be" evaluated the New York Times, and a sign marked "for the simple and informative.

Like Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France and arranged for other platforms nevládl confusion.
So early morning was in the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) far fewer people than usual, inter alia because it was lacking pupils and students.

Turkish justice for the Kurdish party disbanded and this decision brings with it grave consequences.
Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday decided to cancel the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. The decision immediately triggered a protest demonstration s in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of government, which attempts to provide a hand of friendship to the Kurdish community and try to end 25 years of conflict.
Party for Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it has become "a hive of activity against the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he told reporters the Chief Justice Hasim Kilic, after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when to dissolve the most-needed seven votes, Kilic said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Turk and MEP Aysely Tuglukové the prohibition to participate in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr and Mrs Türk Tugluková and confiscation of property by the Ministry of Finance.
DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
Party leadership has indicated before the verdict that members of Parliament rather than leave it served as members of no political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of a process initiated in 2007, the Court of Cassation Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkayem, which accuses the DTP of obedience to the "orders" Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase PKK rebels.
Page assures that the PKK has no "essential link", but refuses to designate a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
Verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community, a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to restrict aid to the Kurds and the PKK to end the conflict.
DTP executives confirmed that the dissolution of the parties could lead to a renewal of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where degenerated in recent weeks, many demonstrations against the conditions under which the detained PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front seat of DTP in Diyarbakir, a major city in the southeast, mostly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, the demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails again and fired stones from slings.
Also demonstrated in Istanbul about a hundred people.
After delivery of the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of justice "will deepen despair.
Turkey is not the question (the Kurds, note. Red.) Resolved the ban, said in the press.
The government, consisting of a party came from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are against the principle of party interference.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is an absolute shooting democratic proposals, the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for reaction from the PKK, he said.
On Thursday, the PKK subscribed to one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
New Silicon-Valley
For years the city paid for the secret, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, the Soviet Union that was closely guarded site where there is carried a secret weapons research.
Today is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from Moscow's center, the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Are placed significant micro-and nanoelectronics research and manufacturing centers.
Since September 2008 established contacts with representatives zelenogradští scientific frankfurtským center Riedberg - with university institutions and firms Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There was a number of reciprocal visits and signed on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd Ridberg a "Protocol for close cooperation.
Russian delegation was led by Moscow vícestarosta Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, head of the Frankfurt signed Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives will go FIZ and small and medium enterprises engaged in research at a seminar přírodovědeckým in Zelenograd.
Scientific Exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZu firms will be allowed to implant in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian companies want to get scientific contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd Russia is home to major research institutes and companies.
These should include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, large corporations and Sitronics Rossiyskaya Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation of "Green City") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape, which are placed in research facilities.
Stuttgart brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 simply can not adequately prepare.
For fans of the project is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well. S21 is more than running the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade building a desperate chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of 80th years.
Head station with tracks that ended in the city center, were then considered the traffic and technical fossils 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transportation, it was enormous need much time to přepřáhnutí locomotive from back to front.
Go, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
Therefore disappearing head station: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route of trans-European highway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 80 years are no longer compatible with reality.
Ourselves very ambitious designers know that the Hessen and Bavarian metropolis is the start of construction almost neufinancovatelné.
Since then, as there are modern shuttle trains and motor vehicles to control both ends, no head station has problems zajížděním and vyjížděním.
Still: It starts with the Stuttgart 21, with a new track ICE to Ulm.
Asserting that the prefects and municipal politicians.
Tracks together, and because the greatest risk of individual infrastructure project in the republic bears the taxpayer and not the state concern.
Urban, the project is still some way to apologize.
Provides a new urban space, which - if we believe the computer images of designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
For rail transport system is detrimental S21.
Transit station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80 years - highlighted the huge increase.
Then there was competition from cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must go but first and foremost on enhancing freight rail transport as is much greener than the freight car on the road.
But the new route is not due to a steep climb suitable for freight trains.
Even more important is that the S21, indirectly affects many other railway projects.
In Swabia be good to bury six billion euros.
This is the official number.
Experts consider the fair ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade will lack funds to other nodal points and bottlenecks in the network.
The Ministry of Transport is a list of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 kilometers long route through the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, this route puts slow pace.
There would need to really push.
But the S21 is as a brake.
Track Rhine valley becomes a bottle neck of international freight transport in the heart of Europe.
Government examines Joined on airport
The provincial government had in Wiesbaden Regional Assembly opened, if you go against a decision Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) to ban night flights and allow him to review.
A coalition of CDU / FDP instructed experts to consider more than the legally 400stránkový Case VGH, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH Kassel in writing to substantiate today that the State had planned for construction north runway at Frankfurt airport to readjust the ban on night flights.

It is damn hard if you can keep their promises, "said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP election slogan" We hold the word.
The Minister rejected the complaint Posch Schäfer-Gümbel, provincial government is trying through "misstating the law and tricks" to get to their nocturnal flights.
Precise legal control takes time.
Coalition wants to work on the "quick first impression."
We need a realistic decision, "said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Statements of his faction to ban night flights were never such as made opposition.

Speed Dial
It was to do a faster than expected.
Station successor unveiled just two weeks after the Board pushed out of office ZDF editor Nikolaus Brender.
Last night he wanted of that panel will agree on a person.
For favorite was called Peter Frey, head of ZDF studio in the capital city of Berlin.
Station but has not confirmed it - officially, the nepředbíhala process.
Could play a role but also that they would not harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schachter, if this proposal at the Board failed.
Frey, Schächterův candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
Voting was not known prior to the closing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, foundered on the Governing Board Schachter with its proposal to extend the Nikolaus Brender contract for another five years.
Brender voted for only seven members, seven were against him. Brenderova loss of the mandate was for Schachter bitter defeat, although she expected.
Union's majority in the Governing Board of the signal for several weeks before the election, he does not want the office to confirm Brender.
Organized resistance to Hessian editor Premier Roland Koch.
Others refused to stay in office highly weighted editor arguing that the monitoring quotas fell Brender, ZDF news.
Until shortly before the election was because protests, which were sharply criticized by political influence on ZDF.
Last mingled in debate even 35 constitutional lawyers who practice Koch evaluated as unconstitutional.
To no avail.
Person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance.
He worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Next stop: 1988 to 1990 personal referent editor, Washington correspondent for 1991/92, leading to 1998 and moderator of "Morgenmagazins" 2001 Head of the ZDF foreign policy, since the leaders of the main study ZDF.
After being Brender, who was on Wednesday elected a professional periodical Medium Magazin journalist of the year, deposed, the Greens announced that they submitted the constitutional claim.
Koch opponent of the Board, Rhineland-Palatinate Premier Kurt Beck, explained last week that the country should change the federal government contract with ZDF to staffing proposals intendant could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude partisan politics from the supervisory boards ZDF.
Brenderův expected successor, Peter Frey, the Governing Board commanded a clever chess move - immediately after the toppling Brender panel will consider strongly criticized.
With this evidence of journalistic independence, he could be nominated for the post of editor without losing face as Schachter and could be appointed by the Governing Board, without coming into believing that he would be expelled through the partisan office.
In the arithmetic of the party anyway Frey classified left-wing liberals.
Study scrapping junk
Partial success for students: After a year of picketing on Thursday, finally drove the Länder Ministers of Culture: The Conference of Ministers of Culture and university rectors, both sides agree that it will improve conditions for the bachelor's degree and Masters.
Students should in future be able to handle their studies.
Specifically agreed to reduce the load tests: the principle that each learning module to terminate one single test.
In addition, should check the workload for learners, and should ensure "fair and affordable rates.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition test between universities in Germany and abroad.
Federal States undertake to establish a flexible joint structure assignment for Bachelor's and Master's study.
Provincial variations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of student protests in the worm have the ministers of culture and university rectors winged words in the mouth of a better education.
Now they are first filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests to drastically reduce in part: "Each module is normally completed only one test," says the 30-page report, which is partly regulate the approval of new fields of study.
"Significantly lower examination burden," said Chairman of the Accreditation Board Reinhold Grimm, should be "stopped mistakes, which significantly limited the performance study."
This should be "performance studies" in the future "decisive criterion" for implementation.
Modules and content 'must check hard "to" unnecessarily restrict the choice of learning
courses.
Students should "create a space that allows and promotes its own initiative.
The rules are to apply for approval of new fields of study, after review but also for the current study.
You need "přeakreditovat" every five years - but this means that it will take until 2015 before they checked all fields of study.
Is responsible for around ten German accreditation agencies, which are subject to accreditation councils established by the Länder.
Ministers of Culture in October called "strongly" Land to the agency, in ways that the content of the curriculum was too big and Examination system was strict.
In some federal countries have universities and colleges by the provincial ministries to agree on the appropriate measures.
As yet the only country of Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should pay particular university tutorial programs and study advice, and strengthen the testing and Foreign Offices.
It wants the country and colleges to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010 the government intends to submit to parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Act.
According to the study by the end of the module should be required only a single test.
Formation of study should be more flexible, to be guaranteed recognition tests from other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of next year should be checked performance of all study subjects in the country.
Government and opposition on Thursday again disputed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise the fallen criticism resolution.
Federal Board of higher Juso groups called for the creation of education policy in the future neodehrávala "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest strike would "do it should at least speak a word" as well as students interested parties.
Future scholars also receive support from the president of the Conference of Rectors of higher education (HRK) Wintermantelové Margret: "We need the experience of students," she said Thursday at a meeting of ministers of culture, with which HRK advice on reform of the common report.
According Odborů Education and Science (GEW), Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They want the legal right which every graduate with a bachelor's degree to allow access to a follow-up Master's degree.
Second, the Land to ensure that today's generation of students for undergraduate courses were tomorrow, there are insufficient places in the masters' fields of study with the best conditions, "said board member Andreas Keller GEW.
Federal land, to employ far more speakers.
Ministers of culture, however, have free access to Master's programs outlay.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and outside is nice, almost no control ... "is the opening line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, in this torn piece of linguistic experience with a theme přicestováním a dissident who won freedom, but also lost their linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of a child book publishing, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was awarded various literary prices, 1993 taught poetry at the Frankfurt Goethe University, legendary, and since 2002 head of Hesse forums Mousonturm literature in Frankfurt.
The mimoliterární great commotion took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where they were "German literature in Romania in the mirror and smashed a mirror its security act".
Apparently uncomfortable and left dumbfounded Söllner declaration in front of fellow writers Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Helmuth Frauendorferem accords to work as a secret informer of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present Söllner won the 1989 German language prize.
Attempts at recruiting apparently began quietly, first in 1971.
I went Söllner, "so someone who did not resist enough attempts to intimidation by the Securitate."
Poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the granting of the Nobel Prize, and Herta Müller's unparalleled literary settlement mechanisms with the dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly a community of German authors from Romania, shaken by a case that indicates the depths of infamy and political system which is based on control and špicování.
Werner Söllner not, at least if it can be said under the existing state of knowledge, only the offender but also the victim.
In Acts Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after the award Söllnerově Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence on him of a secret agent Walter.
"Vysekával 'me that in all important respects to him, says Markel.
Has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllnerovo statement was in this form and before the audience the unexpected, but very surprising return of former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when reading their own deeds, 914 pages, that Germany was a nice reserve for Securitate informer.
Concerned, it can be assumed to be speculating and in some cases probably know which name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu, and just as well Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, has since become a look at some components of stasis, is handling the estate checking Securitate still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education and punk restricted.
One Birthlerových offices, which corresponds to the National Council for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, issuing the act took place, since more lengthy.
Only since 2005 is a law that controls the management of folders.
That former members of the Securitate in Romania have still a big influence, documented after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller a conversation in which one of the former Securitate leaders from Timisoara, commented on nositelce awards hostile.
Has said psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
Condemnation can be expressed quite openly here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that the case Söllner, as in the context of zamlčeným guilt, connected inevitable questions.
Why now? Who is hurt? Specific responses to the audience leaves Söllnerovo returns expected continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge, rather than those pertaining to guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It looked as if he came clean clothes agent of cute Christmas party, where the sporting goods manufacturer distributing sweets, he boarded a quarter past midnight přivolaného Mercedes C Class VfBr new coach Christian Gross, accompanied by orange-colored bag sponsor. ¨
The man with the ball that marked for him had brought him, even after a foreign city.
Otherwise it could drive itself - alcohol is not in the game, drunk with happiness was 55letý man also little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow will continue to work.
Or it just begins.
In the words of a committed only three days from Switzerland: "Although we reached the fourth round, in the Champions League thanks výhře3 1 over Unirea Urziceni in Romania," but we must not let the dazzle success: It's a brutally tough fight against the descent. "
"Far more important task" facing us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the exercise in Mainz and in the royal class of ordinary league date.
And to avoid re-obvious weaknesses of three fast gólech Marica (5), Träsche (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sortition
Round of Champions League (game 16./17. + 23./24 February / retaliation match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will draw lots for the 18th December in Nyon.
Joy of třeskavého taking Babbelova successor will therefore be maintained.
Not only the alleged healer is uncertain Stuttgart professionals said during a short period of self-confidence, willingness to deploy and joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they focus on their strengths, and I told them to be more adventurous, a healer of souls Gross explained as simple-sounding recipe for success, but which, under both the therapist Babbel but he did not show any effect.
Spurred some magic, admitted Babbelův adherent Jens Lehmann, "when in football there's momentum, they become sometimes things that you did not see it possible."
A Sami Khedira, who after mnohatýdenní break caused by injury, became, thanks to its dynamism once the best player on the pitch, he tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new boss: "He's a man who is radical and requires discipline .
That is what the current situation we need. "
In Babbel's obviously missing.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been saved, warns Sports President Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needed but more stability.
As Gross want neither players and managers overestimate the victory against a weak substitute and completely congested defense Romanian guest.
Glasgow would have won even before awakening came after an ugly 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, considering Khedira.
A Sports President Horst Heldt reminded that they have achieved one objective in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're over the hump.
That Heldt at its 40th celebrate birthdays or after the first home victory after three months, was due to weekend events, which recently revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the match.
Decisions, which active than others, and Jens, Heldt said the hard Lehmann's criticism.
Předhazoval weak management and the board decided to change the coach after pressure teenage fans.
And that was canceled the day off after the game, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's remarks "formulates pure egoism," said Heldt and announced consequences for goalkeepers.
Both forties will probably no longer have the joy of life.
In any case, the one with the other, that without the work of the deposed trenérského team would not be so strong and combative players' performances.

Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Chief Greens Jürgen Trittin called because of bad information on the affairs of Kunduz Defense Guttenberg a liar.
SPD and Linke (left) Chancellor invited to submit an explanation.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge to raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "knowingly false", said head Greens Jürgen Trittin in the Saturday news show ARD "Tagesschau".
Call it the usual expression: He lied.
Orders for the killing was issued in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the message, which was NATO, he had read Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday it emerged that the attack was not only the destruction of the hijacked truck, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban.
When the American bombing, which claimed the German commander, Colonel Klein Kunduz, NATO has been under investigation for manslaughter and injury to 142 people.
Greens, SPD and Linke called on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately express the Bundestag and also clarify what he really knew Guttenberg about this event.
Ms Merkel must explain whether it is part of a strategy of targeted killings of Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and if the Office of Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence of this new strategy adopted, Jürgen Trittin called a colleague from the Green Party Renate Künastová.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected criticism.
The Office of Chancellor has no effect on the actual deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also voiced doubts about the loud version of the Ministry of background release of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL inform both Guttenberg correctly and fully the background of the attack on the tank.
Officially it was said that they were denying the existence of the reports of NATO and the Minister concealing sensitive details.
From around the two top officials sounded, however, warned that the Defense Ministry even several reports, including the two-page document commanding Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile requested in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that so far received no response.
Ministry on Saturday did not comment on complaints and pointed out that this will be addressed at the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be appointed next Wednesday.
Dream world
Some see the images in the waking state and hear voices that others see and hear.
Not only mentally ill or drug intoxication merge the boundaries between imagination and reality.
Until this occurs during sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie to shut our eyes in a dark room, we may surround the wildest imagination and fantastical delusions.
But who is experiencing a dream-like states of vigilance, sees and hears things that others see and hear are at today's Western world mostly a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as eccentric.
But such images and voices that do not produce only the mentally ill or drug intoxication.
Guilt is our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there to take care of that blend the boundaries between dream, vision and reality.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best, we call them visions, at worst, delusional.
Although the initiator and the effect may differ, but it mystical visions Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet New Age-Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of mania, psychosis and hallucinations derive from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when there is a derailment of the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain - particularly dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations, and wandering thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The link between dreams and delusions of employed doctors and philosophers since antiquity.
Aristotle understood as a form of hallucination, a dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, said in 1861 "the great similarity ravings with dream states, the Sigmund Freud was a dream even" psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusion, deception of the senses " .
It is autumn 2001, Henning T. as the comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and gaudy color.
Gravity over him no power, floating near the ceiling rooms.
Feels kick up the backside.
Behind him, a winged figure with the Devil red blood grimaces, baring teeth.
Chasing him, kick him in the heavy, fiery shoes, throwing him on the wall, feel the pain throughout the body.
Loud, evil voices from the walls and threaten the radio.
We can not tolerate voices that curse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, zauzlí it into a loop and fastened it on a hook on the ceiling.
Stand up to one speaker and you can loop around the neck.
Jumping.
Loop permits.
Learn, shouting chorus voices tearing his eardrums, "go to a clinic to be treated!"
Henning T. Today is 40 years old, six experienced acute psychosis, the last 2 years, the first nearly 20 years ago.
Were started LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, manic, it also takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with their disease, three years is married.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fears and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a horrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is the second most commonly depression treatment of disease.
Acute schizophrenic psychosis are not affected most of them had distinguished internal and external world, moving into přebuzeného condition that can lead to hallucinations, velikostním, relational illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that Command, comment or maintain dialogue.
Neither optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
Victim is unable to distinguish important from nedůležitého, the brain can not filter out spurious signals, consciousness is flooded with emotions.
Like a dream opens the floodgates flooding psychosis, thoughts and fantasies, which come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
Perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of psychiatry, University Clinic General Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenia is at center stage, everything has a meaning directed at him.
It also gets into a passive role, it happens like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and can actively shape.
Schizophrenia is therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, waking up is excluded.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucination
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but still sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, substantially preserved."
Wandering thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality and experience of alienation is a real framework.
Scientists is still the puzzle as to why our brain is doing exactly the sort of twists.
Exceptional conditions may result from one person to lose the short-term relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone, however, develops into psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins show that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists based on the fact that disabled persons have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stage of development will damage the neuronal maturation of the brain, such as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle, as there is a failure of neuronal systems, which in doing so for years does not materialize.
Factors also play a role around - Stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis when her disposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because encroach transmission system.
When our brains zavař
Crazy is that their Psychotronic suffer hallucinations, and to get rid of them, and swallowed an expensive medication, while others give money for drugs to be obtained, said psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
If we perceive as pleasant reveries or bad, is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten collector for ten years, reports of hallucinations and delusions, in the last year interpreted their results in the book "Die Welt irreale in unserem Kopf" (unreal world in our head).
Although hallucinations are the typical phenomena accompanying psychoses, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depressive illness often as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions halucinuje himself healthy human brain.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, the content consists of ideas, which are normally suppressed.
Arise when the brain, which processes sensory perception, too little repressed or active, if our brain zavař, or the absence of stimulation.
Drugs can run this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worry about love or other more exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, and one third of respondents had reported that at least once in life experienced hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and walk to a nearby gymnasium.
In fact, a normal girl.
Had not seen those shapes and voices.
The breaks may be that it will appeal kolohnát with long, dark hair.
When he replies, looking at her classmates with a surprise - no one except her see and hear the boy.
This shy girl considered stiff dreamer, but Sarah K. dreams, I know.
Is awake, hears and sees the boy, exactly as they hear and see the girl sitting next to each bench.
May even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, is like the boy.
I'm crazy?, Sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears.
The nights are rather disappointing appearances
Delusions are often a burden.
When sitting in class, not how many times following the instruction as a teacher in her eyes and ears was a new classmate, but he said while all other audible and visible on the board of mathematical equations.
At night the phenomena rather depressing.
While waiting in his dark room to sleep, which comes rarely and too late, often can not distinguish whether it is awake or if she was asleep, if the images he sees, grimacing, or cutting a girl with bleeding wounds on the hands and feet resulting from her open or eyes closed.
Leave me alone, yelling at the characters.
Parents and friends say anything about it, thought it about her that was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year did high school graduation and lives with her boyfriend.
Before hallucinations ceased.
Since that time she contacted the internet psychologist Kasten knows exactly that crazy.
Phantoms are also art of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or had taken incentives will likely hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough work and cares for his own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was like a little girl afraid of other children, often playing herself.
The hallucinations began in 13 when he learned that the man who called my dad from the days when she thinks is her own father.
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that process the real sensations and sounds, for people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from one another delusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality shows there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain occur, so the real work. "
Also evaluates Kasten night dreams as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics are psychologically healthy people are able to identify their errors as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advise their patients to evaluate the hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dreams and hallucinations
In our world concentrated too much on the consciousness is imaginary experience, unfortunately most patologizován, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor and chief resident in Heidelberg Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinic-Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is heavy, miserable disease, but it also provides positive, creativity - art is a mirage of desperation.
Schmidt-called oneiroidní Degenhard studied form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroidní states are highly complex, detailed imaginary dreams, which considers the real issue and can not be distinguished from or re-awake state.
Oneiroidní consciousness arises in the extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as inflammation polyradikulárním patients who experience the full knowledge of motor paralysis.
When one is threatened by loss of the world and herself, to be continuous, complete inability to move, replaced by the real life-threatening situation, own, an imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Species status of the border between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change of worlds, the real situation but zpřítomní the idea.
The intensive form of aid and the transfer of the senses in some senses an intolerable situation, which allows people to our own ability to shape, move in an instant loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, and later in the memories
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen oneiroidní describes his experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Replacing heart) as the rescue souls.
He was 49 years old, when, after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation published his consciousness on several track, with his body lay motionless on the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into a world he created, visited a foreign time and place: the old man becomes captive to bed in a sanatorium train, robot guards his health.
Lives in the early Middle Ages, the nobility, which produces drugs from the blood.
The bike he kidnaps Řek to their homeland, in a hospital bed surfs the firn in the Alps and meets Korean goodfellas.
Completely immersed in the imaginary wrong, everything is real, and later in memory.
These inner journey for Claussen fundamentally different from any dream.
Sen is another state, describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams are memories of those mental disorders even after many years and non-essential details clearly obvious.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, show oneiroidní states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also awake our internal images of external reality.
Any change in consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "may lead to distortion of what we call reality."
The fact that can also be rewarding.
Snow may come
Burda
In the 27 children to take over the publishing
New head of publishing Kallen is a temporary solution: Long-term Hubert Burda wants to hand over their business in the hands of their two children, said Spiegel.
Holding is also in the future include 100 percent family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda see their long-term business in the hands of their children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the company, says the man 69letý Spiegel.
Details are to solve carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, is considered later.
I question whether they have ability.
It is not possible to lead the 7500 staff their children if they are not sufficiently competent.
That would kill both children and business.
Burda on Thursday announced that from January withdraws from the Presidency of the Board, and appointed as his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen 52 years since 1999 Member of the board of Burda.
He was initially in charge of technology.
Later, with the Cashier section added responsibility for the company's assets and the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera the direct marketing, Foreigners, Printing and Finance.
For the first time lack of leadership in publishing any of the family members.
Burdovým children are 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, who would today be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Appointment Kallen also serves to make sure we "bridge the 10, 15 years," said Burda.
Holding the future should include 100 percent family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases, and Schickedanz, the Schaeffler Burda expressed that neither the family businesses do not have confidence before the agency: "It touched always companies that they had been infected by a desire for equity, which have speculated and thought that they could become great players.
It was never my strategy.
Never had "dreams of world power," says Burda.
I do not see as a political preceptor of the country, like Springer, and I do not play world league with "Time", these shops are too big.
Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to view mail without the possibility to view a certain type of attachments, or surfing the web.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S., when Time magazine praised it as one of the products of the year.
See it outside is harder, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphone Peek characterized by very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount payable as the iPhone data plan.
Following its success the company has started offering two new devices: one is designed exclusively for Twitter and the other on the basis of continuous provision of free data service, for which it is necessary to pay for Peek six times the amount.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event is the European version of the invention, while his third transformation.
Is limited, like its American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
Monthly cost for maintenance is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming across Europe.
People passengers smartphone already know what it means to lose the data service after crossing the border or eagerly looking cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection), so they can see the mail.
The idea of rooming with a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be in place long ago.
Yes, some companies have special contracts, and travel plans, but according to my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them and very good glasses, so he could read the tiny letters.
European Commission has requested to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is justified concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that remains is called Fon, he does not have WiFi) accomplishes this type of fare, means that operators are beginning to think differently and consider the various offers, kterýmiby compensate for its data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers downloads of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contract, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for the purchase, rather than months.
And that's exactly what I expect that one případěFonPeek occurs, it is a possibility to purchase permanent access to the Peek has already been introduced in the U.S..
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I viewing mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's from a consumer perspective, the best type.
It would be interesting if the same system he used even a computer.
Color, kterouzbožňuje Michelle
Yellow is clearly a favorite color First Lady.
For Barack Obama for the office of U.S. president chose to dress and coat in the color, the same color can also be chosen when accompanying him on the second most important moment of his life: the transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition, it is a similar color - yellow green with shimmer effects-in both cases it was a three-piece set - clothes, bags and coat of the same substance-embroidered or decorated with large collar .
At first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of Princess of Asturias and wear similar clothes.
Substance from which clothing is made, makes two very different models.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace in Oslo velvet with printing.
Amend and add: green shoes with medium-high podpadkem, nynípodobný model, but in gold.
They wear various hairstyles: tentokrátdrdol, before her hair.
75% of working mothers have problems with working motherhood.
Discrimination in employment in recent years has increased, especially in younger women who intend to buy a child.
This is the result of a study "Fertility and working lives of Spanish women's', conducted by the CSIC, in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The study surveyed 9737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are unambiguous: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market because of maternity.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of the partnership co-existence are many differences of opinion on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and depending on the type of job.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner before their first child before giving birth and generally have more children.
From the other side, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector partner cohabitation and motherhood delay, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years with a stable job with their first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of cohabitation with a partner. The figure of 4.1 for women, kterédosažení his stable job to pay the greater part of my life and have therefore postponed partner cohabitation the arrival of children.
Type the profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although a smaller effect on the initiation of living with a partner, "said Margarita Delgado, who is devoted to research in the CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage anarození child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
Differences are also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49 years, women with primary and higher education bore her first child at age 25.1 respectively. 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education to marry and bear their first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education act opposite prefer to obtain stable employment before marriage and birth of first child ", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its representative of the prestigious list: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress becomes the face of various products under the brand universal slogan 'Cause I stand for'.
Representative 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses international level, is thus added to the famous Paris osobnostemL'Oréal such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.

At the meeting, one missing.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model year.

Manuel Vicent donations in 'Esový poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations Fernando Vicente) thirty radiographs writers, whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases, in everyday life).
Does so in a fearsome and predictable genre (biographical similarities, life and work), but looking for something like the core creative personality.
Path brings excitement and fright Vicent sparing no inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader's delight, even in repeated reading.
Here are some observations.

Cowardly aggression
Last week my mother went through seventy of our neighborhoods in the district of Fuenlabrada, a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years, the kolemní and our dog rescued from the pound hybrid weighing more than six pounds, without a word to him twice and kicked severely wounded.
Our anger is all the more that we do not see anything funny in such an aggression against a helpless little animal, which also was on a leash.
A shock to the old lady after this incident when he encountered on a walk with these individuals began to worry about his own safety, since such a devil-possessed man who attacked an animal is able to do the same as a woman, child, old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock, on Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
Male cried all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint with the nearest police station, but I doubt that something was to induce a tricky question, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Outrage forced us to announce this fact.
Understand what is happening with today's youth, when they talk that troubled defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not understand where you happened to good manners, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helm
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial) launched a campaign to promote the use of helm, especially for younger motorists, today both of these bodies informed.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, it is the only means by which to prevent head injuries or death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of its commitment on transport security, which "does more than design and produce even safer products, and confirmed that it tries to achieve this purpose in other ways ie through mentoring and information campaigns.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be' is the first phase, in which more than 500 motorcycles will be deployed fixed boards to get to the attention of the general public.
Finally, Michelin warned that transport safety is a constant problem "of the company, a manufacturer of double-bike tires for vehicles and whose main aim is to continuous improvement of product safety.
Increases sales of light commercial vehicles
After nearly two years, the market begins to recover light-duty vehicles.
All 9425 vehicles registered in Spain in November resulted in an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what's more, this is the first increase after 22 months of continuous decline, according to the figures of patronage organization Anfac manufacturers and retailers Ganvam.
The positive figure is better to put in quarantine since November 2008 is very bad period for comparison and marked 60% reduction compared with the previous year.
The consequence is that despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months are 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, prodáno95.853 vehicles, which includes all kinds of vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of cars, pick ups, vans, small trucks and light trucks / bogies.
A gloom disappeared, or the most damaging inquiry, even if bought by private individuals, the majority of purchases implement small and medium-sized companies and almost 100% of cases, the financing through third parties.
The constraints resulting from the closure of bank loans, the source must be added other factors such as cessation or continuation of bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike cars, support for the purchase 2000E helped too.
In addition to private individuals should be noted iosoby business a commercial small and medium-sized companies that intend to buy a light utility vehicle of 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions levels exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday Ganvamu again reminded of the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
Sellers Association expects that 2010 will be to develop similar to last year, according to calculations, the sale of passenger cars and 4x4 drops by 19%.
Support system for hand-brake is now mandatory equipment.
As in the case antiblokovacího ABS system is that the ESP stability control, auxiliary systems, hand brake, it all becomes compulsory fitting of European cars.
In fact, form part of the compulsory fitting of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is fixed term for any shortcoming, which is February 2011th
Measures introduced in the EU aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians, the works that may help to avoid many collisions.
Auxiliary hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, this system detects when the driver presses.
But not always able to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by an automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident, nesešlápli brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the full power of the brakes.
Up to 1100 accident
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum braking systems, reducing the stopping distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment could be avoided and 1 100 fatalities per year related to pedestrians.
Reducing this number will be even more marked-from calculations in order to prevent one of the four incidents affecting the person-after the introduction of so-called intelligent systems handbrake.
In this case, a vehicle equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) captures the obstacles and report that the driver, except for light braking.

After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets again emerged on the market uncertainty, which should not come as a surprise, since this is already a natural state in an environment where managers take decisions on the future, which is itself themselves uncertain.
The drug is used by central banks to stabilize the debt market was the realization by direct purchase of assets and liquidity in the indirect release rate close to zero, the financial institutions to buy asset to the deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets, has virtually ended, and without undermining their disparate liquidity policy, starting to throw some sand into the gears, as it did the Spanish Central Bank to its auctions last year.
Investors, therefore challenge the ability of the world economy to keep the economic recovery without the heterodox measures, and participate in the return of risk reduction benefits.
Mobility and Exchange differences dluhopisůspolečností regain points, although they are still very distant abnormal levels, which reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected the public debt.

Spain this instability was almost hit, but at that time came, Standard & Poor's threatened a new revision of the reduction skills Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is useless to silence the advocates of moral hazard, who again tried to charge to the conscience of those responsible for global economic policy because of the devastating effects of braking control credit on employment, when in fact they would need to declare a new day of thanksgiving.

Does not make sense that the Ecofin saving Hungary from failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow member countries of the euro has not fulfilled its obligations.
But what makes sense is that the Ecofin forced the Greek government to transparency and commitment of its people to a shared responsibility for the necessary emergency measures to maintain stability of its public finances.
If, as expected, we are before the normalization of the transition risk premiums, excesses of some of the positions would be supported in anticipation.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as bonds of European companies do not have to worry.
If Europe is reduced and our differences will be further extended, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
Matter Standard & Poor's is a joke. When our leading indicators of forcing the majority of studies to anticipate the renewal of its scenarios and revise its scenario increases for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenarios for the Spanish economy it foretells a great chance to meet the survival of the alert.
Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy assets of Spanish, as being "careful, pal drivers.
