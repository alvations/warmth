Food is to blame for European inflation
Why in the eurozone headline inflation are the soaring prices.
In the 13 countries in the eurozone was the rise in November higher than we expected - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent, as the statistical office of the EU in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian Federal Reserve has the European Central Bank (ECB) the Leitzsins not reduced. Their discretion if interest rates rising commodity prices and the slight drop in unemployment the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is anxious, inflation below 2 %, or at least zwei-Prozent-Marke to short.
According to an analyst is the ECB on the horns of a dilemma: should be inflation "ring," in subsequent action.
With 3.3 percent, the rate of inflation in November in Germany zwölf-Jahres-Rekordhoch; in Spain billboard the rate of 3.6 at 4.1 percent.
Responsible for the rise in inflation in the eurozone are increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF-Weizennotierungen rose 88 percent, and of course for soya beans also an rekordhoch achievements since 1973.
Also in cooking oil and milk products, there was a significant rise in 2007.
The world price of crude oil this year rose by 52 % - last month, the price per barrel of black gold - almost 100 US dollars.
The ECB is inflation, according to the 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 percent increase, expected in 2009, with a decline of 1.9 percent.
For the next three or four months go by a 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate analysts, either the annual euro-area average but with 2.1 percent.
For 2008 experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup ortet political crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz-Sympathisanten by early December has grown considerably since 2002. Once the party on the main base, while the vote for the Socialists, according to the Gallup an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
Among the parteitreuen electorate is the difference, thanks to a high of Oppositionsbefürworter clear: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are one-fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
At SZDSZ, and according to the survey of Einstiegshürde parliamentary politics: they have come in the population of around two percent.
The number of Parteiwähler in both camps have grown at a rate of 1 %.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood continues to deteriorate, never before has the proportion of the country's economic situation as "very bad" judge as high (41 percent), while another 46 percent for " pretty poor ".
After hoffnungsvolleren prospects in the spring and summer are the families the change their financial situation has once again pessimistischer.
For the coming year, does the majority of the population with a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth of a recovery.
A gallup-umfrage conducted in December showed that 71 percent of respondents - an all-time high, the work of the prime minister as "more poorly than right" judged.
Thirteen percent of those surveyed have great faith and confidence in General Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the percentage of those in favour for Viktor orbán 38 per cent.
Some 54 % trust the government, compared to 27 % distrust of the leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood, the number of those who believe that it could be the dissatisfaction with the prime minister even without a change of government in control.
There were following the riots last October 35 % for the whereabouts of the government and the government, the figure stands at only 20 %, while the relative majority (33 percent) the only solution for new elections.
Asked after her interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "certainly" participate and another 20 % of their vote " probably ".
By comparison, the parliamentary elections this Sunday, would only be 55 percent "with security," go to the polls, another 15 % think their participation for " probably. " these trends would be the outcome of the referendum is to be expected.
74 % would be against the tuition fees, 79 % against the Praxisgebühr, and 84 % against the Krankenhaus-Taggeld votes.
Space to the Group of the referendum, " with security would participate in the shares of the opponents of the study, based on practice and hospital even 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco has increased by nearly one-fifth
The Budaörser Handelsgebiet Hypermarkets in this year, the average increase of 16 percent from last year, with the difference that there was this year no increase in the value-added tax.
Gazdaság Napi article from
The Budaörser Handelsdreieck did the price of a traditional Weihnachtskorbes Napi " ' this year increased by 16 percent, but it Hypermärkten in all price increases over 1000 HUF recorded.
After prices in the lebensmittelmärkten last December davongaloppiert " the prozentuell rise not drastic, compared with the already high, former initial level.
However, it is the consumers certainly deterrent that what he last year HUF far below 9,000 had paid this year 10,000 to HUF.
The price of Warenkorbs Napi " ' the Magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze crossed HUF at least 91 in the subjects of the markets.
The highest 10.573 HUF price fraud.
(In 6800, the 6.800 price in HUF)
Prices for Unicum and vibrant fish Vorjahresniveau remained practically, have grown sharply, however, are the prices of Putenbrustfilets and poppy, testament.
Prices of flour and bread with the data from the Central Statistics Office of Hungary, Auchan by 1kg, however, there has been Brotwecken for 139 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into.
There was the product of a competitive drop to below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into.
Equally surprising was here, the price of a Pfandflasche two litres of Coca-Cola below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into claimed, so the drink, including HUF only 257 deposits.
However, this year's average Napi in "Warenkorbs-Vergleich Auchan" most expensive, and Cora at best.
Our calculations showed that Cora prices in the "Napi" to the Weihnachtspreisen basket last year to 15, while Auchan Tesco and 18 percent respectively.
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive this year's fraud 12 %, whereas the billigstem increase between basket in the past year and teuerstem this year, 21 %.
The average 1.480,00 HUF boom fraud.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into still, however, the VAT hike imposes price last Christmas.
It is this process has taken the trade predicament: apparently such could not quite decide what preisspanne you in the individual articles should apply, because the consequences of raising prices on consumers incalculable.
(If the distributor umlaufgeschwindigkeit a product which is bad, it can make significant gains in the preisspanne, Verkehrsintensität that.)
Mehwertsteuer-bedingt, the Napi rise of the "Warenkorbes" last year so radical that the most expensive basket the value of 1720 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into 2006 crossed to draw, whereas the cheapest basket just 844 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into fraud.
This year, such extreme not seen as the most expensive 1.630,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into a basket for more expensive than last year, and even the cheapest, there was a 1.284,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into of price increases.
Compared with the last two Weihnachtssaisons became a disastrous effect of the increase, the price of homes in the Hypermärkten of them in less than 20 months to more than 30 percent.
(This, in turn, confirmed the data is not necessarily the Central Statistics Office of Hungary: some basic foodstuffs, the statistics office during the period of 12 months, a more than 30-prozentige high prices.
So in addition to flour with eggs.)
But if you look in the "Napi" market basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, because the price level of expensive product last year, even in the worst case, little more than 10 percent rise.
Mehllieferanten are obviously in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - it was the drastic increase to the multinationals.
Happy Handelsdreieck complain aren't the Hypermarkets starting; it is not by the good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warenhäusern no longer on prices.
It will especially large quantities, have bought paletten foods are Ladentische about it.
Wednesday morning, there were in all three warenhäusern epic in the Kassa queues, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country Kundenfrequenz reported a drop, so many Meinungsforschern multinationals to complain that they could not even the planned turnover, not only with food, but also in sustainable consumer products.
It is widely used to save
This year, more than a thousand infections in hospitals, which lead to the improper handling of antibiotics were due.
Sanitary conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding in the beds, congestion of personnel - all factors that the tide of infections are not necessarily favourable, such as the chief of the National Epidemiologiezentrums doctor.
It is widely used as well.
Traumatologie-abteilung of the János hospital MRSA-Infektion was recently diagnosed with it.
The antibiotic-resistant bakterium has found a male patients and, after a serious accident ended up in hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection.
The injured have been hospitalized because of a serious released from the hospital, not long after the man was MRSA-Infektion with a return was an important operation because of the Bakteriums since then, which is still in the patient's body, not yet.
To 10 December of this year, 1094 from hospitals were generated by multi-drug resistant virus infections to the National Nosocomialis reported surveillance system, such as the chief of the National Epidemiologiezentrums Doctor Böröcz, Karolina.
So many people, generated by multi-drug resistant virus infections in hospitals with security, the real figure may be higher.
About two thirds of (683 infection cases of MRSA), Methicillin-Oxacillin, which triggered Staphylococcus aureus resistant.
Staphylococcus aureus that bakterium (SA), about a third of the people in front of their noses, without there being a disease.
Sa-bedingte infections Halsentzündung (such as mandelentzündung, inflammations, the skin and wounds) tend to respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
The resources are, however, too large extent or incorrectly applied, are respondierenden from the good antibiotic-resistant bacteria in appropriate conditions in hospitals quickly spread.
Especially in patients with geschwächtem, or durable poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight can these bacteria severe infections, Wundinfektion or such as Blutvergiftung, Sepsis, cause.
The medical director of the János hospital show that the MRSA-Infektion nothing special such incidents are part of the Krankehausalltag.
We should not infected with the epidemic manhte Tibor confuse Nyulasi - MRSA, there is just not where they are not.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, nursing staff Gummihandschuhe bears and masks supply, and we have the treatment for necessary antibiotics Tibor", Nyulasi.
When they arrived at the hospital patients on MRSA, an infection, there is not always to be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of MRSA caused by infections in hospitals would be preventable, but whether the current conditions and circumstances of bad for the control of the emergence or the spread of multiresistenten anthrax Karolina Böröcz says.
After this infection in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should take the eingelieferten MRSA-infizierte patients immediately investigated and isolated.
In the Hungarian hospitals will not, however, microbiological being so often practiced.
Not least because the state health insurance fund no subsidies for this survey.
Most of the cases that come to light only if the patient MRSA-Infektion a bemerkbare, so medical head of the Epidemiologiezentrums.
Part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotika-therapien should be targeted, in other words, microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the funds, but will this directive of hospitals are not always respected.
Among the ambulanten, or in the care of patients microbiological sampling were even more rare, Böröcz Karolina.
Saved used in the
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA of a patient at the other most of the nurses.
That is precisely why händewaschen does, or wearing of gloves and masks a great importance, however, there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
Tröpfcheninfektion MRSA is transmitted or contact in the domestic hospitals, but not always the possibility to isolate infected patients.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds short ranked each, although you from epidemiological point a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
Karolina Böröcz as further points out, it is, unfortunately, in the financially less well-off hospitals even before that used in, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that the emergence of infections positively.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequently, or can the further spread of the anthrax stopped, where they are met, Böröcz Karolina.
Manifesto against MRSA
Mrsa-infektionen grip on the health caused enormous costs, so you will fight all.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their control of the government program.
After the first signs of the programme is successful, as published data, is the trend of MRSA-Infektionen in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has prevented the emergence of multiresistenten prion (including MRSA), and the prevention of infections in hospitals, one of his key priorities.

Bulgaria, which Immobilien-Paradies the EU
The development of of the Bulgarian immobilienmarktes is so pleasant - the whole of Europe is looking carefully for the previously mentioned rarely Balkan nations.
What, where and who is buying the still the cheapest market in the EU, but is more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian simply / Max division.
Bulgaria is now the Immobilienkäufe begehrteste plaster for the Eastern European space with favourable Skiappartements and houses at sea.
Between the mountains Bansko include the Borovec Pamprovo, Vitosa, and one of the most popular, the sea are Albena, the "Goldküste", the " Sonnenküste, " and historic Städtchen Nessebar Sozopol and the stars but around Kavarna properties and Balcik are increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by simply / Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior WID sooner or later, to attract investors, such Veliko Gabrovo Tarnovo,, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very favourable area recorded by Russian more buyers.
The capital Sofia also provides tempting offers, offering trade and space for offices and meeting high returns.
Bulgaria is on the way of one of the most attractive Golferparadiese of Europe, and above the winter or summer period, winter tourist season also in the other two seasons of attracting tourists.
Therefore, forward-looking investors buy already in the big picture, for example, around Bansko.
Analysts are, according to people who buy property in Bulgaria, also changes in their lebenswandels.
Most buyers are English, it is also interested in France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, whereas the Black Sea and in the ski resorts are predominantly Russian buyer.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Regionaldirektor Jankov, Georgi by simply / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle revitalisierte either, buying 50-100.000 property to EUR run-down houses, or 5-15.000 euros to which they renovate itself.
Good connections and access and communications are important, but also the proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category are those in search of a Feriendomizil (Bulgaria in December among the top ten destinations of German listed).
The third group of businessmen make with the objective of a medium to long-term value investing.
Real estate in the capital are expensive, however, due to the growing demand.
Within the EU, housing prices in Bulgaria, the lowest in the last five years, though, there was a with 21 percent per year.
The rise in housing prices in a year far exceeds the raising of salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
Gábor Fodor as minister of environment, the experts on Tuesday at an end, and the debate on the international Klima-Regime after 2012, the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening continued.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are debating the roadmap in Bali, in which the emissionsreduzierenden measures for the period after 2012, after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is a heated debate between developed and developing countries in progress.
The United States has already signalled that they have specific figures do not want to negotiate, but would you be prepared until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 25-40 percent.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are ready, apart from the reduction of emissions of the developing countries, both financially and technologically.
It was also an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol Fund accused of a 16-köpfigen Council, will probably be managed in the Global Environment Facility (GEF funding has declined) the UN, as és in "Piac" reported profits.
Hungary 6 %
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor on behalf of Hungary supports the ambition of the EU their role in global Klimaschutz-Maßnahmen, and by 2009, a new international agreement.
The minister said that the EU will by 2020 greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % (compared to 1990 levels), regardless of whether the "agreement after 2012 achieved" successful or not, and the union would be ready for a 30-prozentige soferne reduction, other major industrialized nations in the world, or developing countries are also ready to comply with their obligations under forces and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a reduction of only 5.2 percent, while the EU and its then 15 Member States already at A minus 8 %.
The premise of Hungary is reduction of greenhouse gases by 6 % compared to the years 1985-87 - a figure that the country will meet in the press release issued by the ministry reported.
The stakes are high in Bali, have klimapolitische the long-term international agreements within two years to be ready, otherwise it would only after 2012, come into effect. In this case, the Reduktionsvorhaben Kyoto Protocol No international Emissionsreduktionssystem again, whose importance the IPCC, the International, Nobel peace prize recipient Klimawandel-Komitee the UN science in its latest report pointed out.
That would delay the emission reductions, and increase the temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius in would be inevitable, according to the wissenschaftern extremely serious and irreparable consequences.

Political capital: Staatsrisiko increased Hungarian GUARD
According to the Department for Risk Analysis (risk Analysing division) of political capital, the activities of this August, with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary " formed Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects.
In the "Risikowarnungs-Bericht" of the institute says, among other things, that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard, the highest political risk, " the tightening of existing ethnic tensions between Gypsy and Nicht-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, even in the short term to violent ethnic clashes could lead. "
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably at the provocation of this conflict, such as the one.
As has been reported, this will be a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People seen in public life, the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups, which now has its political strategy on the Roma-Ungarn-Gegensatz have built."
It is believed that this is the problem, the sensible dialogue impossible, injuries, and the likelihood of violent clashes would increase.
The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad substantial damage, particularly in terms of confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned."
We remember that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary steadily on the rise, so since the summer of 2007, "Selbstverteidigungsverein" national organisations were set ablaze.
"These groups share the common characteristic of each define a civil organisation, while you open going to claim that its members - sometimes prepare armed - defence tasks (civil defence, defence, Ordnungshütung), invoking the ineffectiveness of the police, the Army, or the state itself," it said.
It continues: all of this is in accordance with the method tried, several of Parteiverdrossenheit policies and the peoples' political aspirations as civil initiative to disguise.
The emphasis on the civilian character and Vereinsform are not merely the circumvention of legal hurdles in the process of registration could appear in court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis suggested that the activities of risikoerhöhenden Hungarian guard a factor for relations with neighbouring states.
" In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several of its neighbours as a potential source quoted some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbouring sees the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti-Ungarn-Politik.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region, " it said.
From the point of view of the institute is the creation of the Hungarian guard Zentral-Ost-Europa no entry in, so the political risk for the entire region.
As has been reported that the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding in August 2007 from the extreme right-wing Bulgaria BNU National Union ().
In the light of the emergence of Bulgarian guard Roma-Massenausschreitungen were in a built-up areas of Krasna Poljana (Sofia).
The BNU has the facts straight to the source of the founding of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the Organization of the "national protection."
In their view, was in the past 17 years Zigeunerterror a veritable "significantly" in Bulgaria, the government has, however, remained inactive and indifferent, as political capital.
And further: the initiative had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public opened up.
As I said, the increased risk for ethnic conflict is also shown by the fact that some Roma-Organisationen of Bulgaria announced Widerstandszwecken to their own guards.
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, shows, it is not impossible that the Hungarian Roma with whom to organize their own protection, on the threats, according to the Risikowarnungsbericht of political capital.
Forschungsdirektor Attila Juhász, said in political capital on question of the nachrichtenbüros: the analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes.
Risikoanalyseberichte would be published annually, and if risikoverändernden tendencies will be public opinion informed, as in the case by the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes.
The season are not widely holidays
In Hungary are holidays carefully regulated by law, so that the practice of Umdisponierens the days around the holiday season has become established, but brings in the coming year less such days.
Also in the EU and in America, you understand, "Holiday."
Hungarian Justice distinguishes between Staatsfeiertagen and why days.
Arbeitsfreie days are mostly religious holidays, or with important historical events in context.
We are celebrating the New Year holidays: both the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the New Year Arbeitsfreie are days - the latter alone Silvester-Feiernden to rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of 14 holidays.
The Staatsfeiertage are the 15 march to the revolution of 1848, and reminiscent of 23 October, the day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August is the formation of a state, on May 1, celebrated the work on 1 and 2 November we remember our dead.
In addition, there are two breaks, pfingsten at Easter and Christmas.
Since our heads of state, national or religious holidays rarely on a weekend, has the practice of "Arbeitstags-Verschiebung" in some cases, in which we before or after the holiday just a day would work.
The price of extended weekends, however, that we samstagen from the very well working or in school.
When the day before or after the holiday, ultimately will be dealt with, for long years of labour in a specific regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, for public employees and officials of public service.
Here are only exempted firms and institutions in which the company without interruption, which includes the holidays.
This year, the working order only by the festive season slightly confused: 24 December remains formally life here, since most of the days between Zeitausgleich Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the special suspended vacations.
Next year more days' holiday in the Wochenmitte, or at the end of the week, so that the Umdisponierungen working days will be less than this year.
The calendar will first around the Labor Day "on its head," so that the people just four days in a row can stay at home.
Saturday, April 26, will be a day for the Friday, 2 may be a day of rest.
The second umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will Friday 24 October completion in advance.
At the end of the year, however, is completely under the sign of the holiday season, after starting on the 24th December and remains, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six chilling details about freedom to annoy
Email that abzuschicken, we forget Sprachnachrichten, which we never received harmless lies are not more notice: they offer "colour" in the everyday life in the workplace.
The question is, whether we used these small inconvenience, or it is better to the challenge and tried this cause misunderstandings vexing for others to vermweiden situations.
Tipps.
"Sorry, I forgot you that somebody Marketing-Abteilung called the" - says a colleague.
We missed a meeting?
At best, it regrets and trying to make it, perhaps, during Marketing-Abteilung ringing and reumütig grants, it might have been forgotten, the news host (that is, the less routine way).
Usually it's an apology.
Before being involved in embarrassing excuses, we should consider how his colleagues truly uncomfortable moments may cause and try to avoid situations aware.
Something borrowed, which is not a itself?
There is little Nervigeres, as if a document in Bürozubehör, or the phone, but it is not there.
Yesterday, the Heftgerät still on the desktop, today it is way too early?
Or will the lost imagined pens around on the desk of a colleague who discovered?
No one should ask any of my colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they see that something is out.
Kuverts so, no Post-its or from the office in the bag, because it might be a themselves: no longer here, if you ' s but badly needs.
Getratsche on the private lives of gentlemen?
There is no effective means of Tratsch, one in the world has been set.
Anyone with whom, what?
Where and why?
The information (or conjecture) on the private lives of colleagues as possible, not at all tied to the nose!
And if someone is open and his intimacy secret suggests, we should not abuse this trust.
The best one is like a grave, rather than just not here, even if others on the problems of colleagues know.
Without reason ill informed?
If you are in office, possessed by invoking nagging headache ill, because it just feels uneasy, or simply to rest, we should be clear about one thing: their own work, unextendable settlement, projects with fixed deadlines should the members Instead of a burn itself out.
The ball is not evil.
If you are on the eve knows that it is the next day, the office will create dazwischenkommen or something, so it could stay at home, you should have reported it in good time, so that neither the House nor the head unexpectedly with the absence.
Gesumme Gekicher, telephone,
It is precisely in his work, but by Gekicher the members are upset?
Mitgehört unwanted phone, you had better not hear?
The members do not sing with sums are conversations (over their heads), Getrampel leads, constant rant or grumble nerve.
All of this can be very disruptive, even if they are not a task (letter) is planning to organise deepened.
Is always the fault?
Is a project is not completed on time, it has been an important letter or Nachrichte abzuschicken forgotten is important, it is the fault of their own people not be there.
After possibility should be limited to the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues excuses!
The best they his mistake and apology, if others were concerned.
The question of how to repair the mistake, or it can do so is all too apt.
In the office - a feeling at home?
Schlapfen Trainingshose and: convenient for home, but the office has lost nothing!
Not even should then be Leger dress as if the job would allow!
Just not too messy - we should both his colleagues, as well as respect themselves that people in the kleidet office accordingly, if desired, beautiful and elegant.
We want to make all the right - or, as it will be interesting for others
Stop and go-Verkehr, a car in the middle of the allmorgendlichen jams.
From the radio erklingt a strange tune: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
The vociferousness I Mr. higher.
The pace of change, in addition to the strains, the utterly and, as a true Klangjuwel a female choir.
It is the song Wings of Love "Zagar" mr2, erklingt on.
The domestic musikszene has long been a luxury Electropop with qualitative.
But now, even the gridlock different if you consider the new Zagar album of listens.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new and exciting production from the domestic Underground-Szene digital are slow to change the overall picture, and even if the Garagenrock with his Gitarrengequitsche in the Electropop indigenous shows: there are new under the sun.
Zságer Balázs in Pécs musizierte itself started Yonderboi in the band, before he - perhaps because a pub with no two Pfeifer sustain - His Own Path began.
The breakthrough came with his project Zagar (to) and his music, elements of jazz, electronic and pops conflates, but he managed only when one with a request that the Soundtrack to a film on him lasting was approached (
'Szezon Ferenc Török').
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, became the broader audience only known as the wan2 "magazine" its first album in 2002 under the alben top 50 domestic Zagar included and, together with Yonderboi, for almost one, even in the West kürte with trendsetter.
There is no doubt that Zagar were and his band "trendy" it interested but not, whether you like this brand.
The band has responded, but it should be: a new, better album.
It appeared, new album entitled " cannot Walk Instead fly ' could you open up new paths, however, the title expresses the desire to Pécser continuity with the years.
The expression from the time Zságer than Balázs with another band was away.
The luftige, flying allusion would indeed be in order, however, is not only the ethereal when nature of the music, the spirit and the trends are Gitarre appropriate - louder, the impact of rock and roll.
With these liedern has been living in England and with the band, "the puzzle," Ligeti singer György working in the Millenáris premiere.
A song from the album has even Radioschlager managed to - the recently from early morning until late mr2 pop music origin Hörern Petőfi has no "Wings of Love," with the participation of six of Sängerinnen domestic Divas (" Underground ") was added to Ohrwurm assault on the set.
All right (?).
The hvg.hu has Zságer Balázs demand.
Hvg.hu: this new bestseller raises the question: what is your music a certain class reservations?
Zságer Balázs: the word "Schichtmusik" means not much.
In my opinion, there are two castes in the pop music, not mainstream and Underground, or alternatively and pops, but commercially and honest.
Even so-called alternative or Underground-Musik and can be rather meaningless as you can, but only for sale are produced, commercial music.
A good Pop-Nummer from an honest motive.
The Hörers the hospitality also functions on that principle of languages and borders independent.
Hvg.hu: you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience your music?
Example: Zs abroad, especially west of US pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only Twens teenagers or at concerts, but also the older audience.
You follow the trends in the pop music, around you happen much more closely because they did for part of contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what role the audience to in your work?
It is important that those who, where and how many of your music?
B. Zs.: of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more to our concerts.
But we have never komponiert on the market.
When the music is not in order to serve a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is generally in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there are, in turn, only in the ungreifbaren changes in the moment.
Still, I am struck by one thing: you want to please everybody, but if you are not more interesting.
Hvg.hu: how far möchtest du the example of Yonderboi consequences?
He is Solist and as his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: we are not really making its way this time to mention that we are constantly tried this in our music.
We are looking more like a Teamplayer on the musical presence of the other confidence and they develop themselves.
Of course, was originally compare our work with the Yonderboi will be inevitable, because many of us from his band come and take a different path.
Hvg.hu: mr2 Charts of Petőfi says "Wings of Love" in the first place.
Many have only in connection with this number is the name of Zagar.
Was the opening with a slightly populäreren style in the direction of a broader public deliberately orchestrated?
B. Zs.: we had no plans to write a bestseller, as the spearhead of the album detract.
In this song is about more.
It was the final leg of the Albums, the Klangorgie and the rather more difficult issues to resolve.
Hvg.hu: how do you Sängerinnen the six selected?
Why, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: the basic idea was to Gospel-artigen a chorus.
Then came the idea Solisten open as talented choir from the domestic musikszene.
The sechsköpfige chorus emerged - Kutzora Sena, Edina, Bori Judie Jay Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi, Neo [LEFT-BRACKET for] Németh Juci - which we can apäter 'Underground' Divas.
Wolltest hvg.hu: the song as, or have shaped the girls?
B. Zs.: no, there was a long-time in the Instrumentalversion, but as the material on the album was finished, we thought that this number still "something needs."
The Akkordenabfolge, for Gesangsstimme.
I have the tune in eingesungen the same night, then you have the girls learned.
There was practically everything right and shocking spontaneously.
I can remember quite at that time, I was elektrisiert, but it was also the "Divas" were needed.
With my voice alone would not be the song never so strongly.
Hvg.hu: both on the record, the concert, but the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no Solo-Part (apart from the brief solo by Judy Jay), they have no role sung entirely together and are no louder than the music, so their singing from music not only.
Also on the scene, they stood behind.
It is intention?
B.zs.: that she stood at the back, was due to technical problems.
However, we wanted to Solo-Rollen deliberately not them.
The issue is also about his ego somewhat forgotten, forget who came from and where there is, let us simply that this particular wing, the emporheben wing of love.
I would like to see other this euphoric state, we have felt when the song.
Hvg.hu: what was the most expensive song?
B. Zs.: when the Schaffensarbeit musical actually none, it has more to conjure up potions more difficult tasks.
For example, in "Dorian Gray 's dilemma," in which I was in a Konzertklavier games, or " rock and roll goes to the girls,' where the Groove longer would not work, but that has brought everything, like a jigsaw puzzle.
Hvg.hu, what is your Lieblingsnummer from the new album?
B. Zs.: this is changing with the concerts consistently and even now, as I losgelasssen the album '.'
Currently there are "prophet is a Fool," " Escape From the Earth and the number of " never the same. "
Fraudulent broker were billions of inferiority
Extreme fraud.
One of his former employees Kerviel Jerome Bankenriese of France Société Générale, Komerční owner of banka.
Indeed, it was appropriate for nearly five billion euros.
But it seems rather Kerviel so that only a great player, was it to his colleagues wanted to do the same, moreover, was certainly not incapable.
In contrast to Bankhäusern all big time, he amerikanischenn the crisis in the mortgage market.
"He is mentally weak," was out of the mouths of his superiors to hear him in the police indicate.
But as Kerviels from the statements indicate that the French media, for example, the newspaper Le Monde, published, he was a man, at the end of last year with his business profits of EUR 1.6 billion.
Crisis, not only in America
"Everything that I was on my bank to earn money," he said in his statement.
During the summer, he has succeeded in the American crisis half a billion euros.
The opportunity he had already been erspäht at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news about Sub-Prime-Hypotheken is, as you low-income customers and Abzahlungsprobleme earlier had to be made into difficulties.
Influence on the whole economy should this crisis but do not have.
Kerviel did not and reserved the right.
He had at the end of its profit, up to EUR 1.6 billion hochgeschraubt.
"When I saw the first half-billion warranted, I did not, as I explain should Kerviel," and goes on to say that he definitely nothing to keep for themselves.
During the entire interrogation, he admitted that he falsified documents so that he is not to be introduced.
He was even his bosses wool over the eyes, even though gradual Eurex-Börse for his business interested.
Risikoprofit
Aufzufliegen feared he?
Hardly.
"I thought the simple fact that I am in favour of the bank earned 1.6 billion was satisfied."
Where he had the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually formulate its position.
In the Société Générale he in 2000, immediately after his studies at the University of Lyon had ended.
It was around 51000 compensate US dollars.
After two years, it has been already assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became independent broker with a 90000 compensate for dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he had never seen so much deserve as others.
" My first conversation in 2005, I knew that I have been observed.
Because of my training and my professional and personal development, " Kerviel told the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first major success.
In the shares of alliance he earned by the bombings in London in half a billion euros to kursverluste this title.
And that was the catalyst - now he wanted more.
Until you make a profit, let you
"This is like a snowball," he said the policemen.
But the bosses knew allegedly of everything, or knew it.
"As long as I earned money concluded."
But then came at the start of this year, the big blow.
On a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted it.
On Monday, when he came to work, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it is appropriate lost five billion euros.
And how they were introduced him?
He made suspect by a holiday.
" I have just four days last year.
A broker, which takes no holidays is one who does not want him just look at the cards, " said Kerviel finally.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission yesterday signed a total of nine programmes, through which the Czech Republic in the next few years to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kronor).
It is at about half the money, the Czech Republic in 2007 to 2013 from Brussels at all.
About 125 billion kronor from seven regionalentwicklungsprogrammen come.
Czech companies are around 100 billion kronor from the " enterprise and innovation can be given.
The most money, approximately 150 billion, in the Verkehrsausbau.
The verkehrsprogramm is the largest development program and covers up to 22 percent of the funds, the Czech Republic from the fund.
This money in the budget, increased the state Verkehrsinfrastrukturfonds, the next year on 90.8 billion.
The programme " companies and innovation, entrepreneurs and companies serve up money to innovative enterprises.
The companies to finance for the introduction of new technologies and Unternehmensforschung, but also for the organisationsmethoden win more effective.
Geld-aquisition thus far of the Czech Republic from EU funds is among the new countries to the least successful.
Nicaraguanisches Court confirmed expräsidenten sentences for twenty years
A court in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty years of imprisonment of the former president Arnold Alemán, 2003 because of financial fraud to the tune of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kronor) was convicted.
Later, but he was released from jail and has lived under house arrest Hazienda on his nicaruanischen in the metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) that Central American country back behind bars, according to the AP news agency is unclear.
The chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will, according to the Haftbeamten now determine whether we Alemán his punishment are at home, or whether he is put in prison.
A court rejected four years after that Alemán government money in accounts of foreign companies in Panama had postponed.
These firms were fiction and the accounts were, in fact, his family and closest supporters.
Some of this money landed in a fund, the Alemán to finance his campaign had set up in 2001.
Budget is through
Yes, it is.
The budget is approved.
What is it about this budget special?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted, and without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit was adopted.
For the current year, even with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it approved Sobotka minister (the party) had presented ČSSD, and therefore could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government was nothing dramatic about this time.
The Congress of Deputies, approved this traditionally little noticed, but the most significant act calmly.
This is a certain irony.
Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether we like it or not.
The budget is an integral part of politics, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is for the media dankbareres the issue, so you devote more attention to him.
A dispute among politicians in public is much more interesting than sober figures.
The budgets were among the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses in the budget for the year 2008 can eliminate all at once.
The first is the high proportion of expenditure, the legitimately binding, and it is not only the pensions, but also social spending, " the implicit ' ČSSD coalition and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the budget policy as are basic shortages of Schwachpunkts.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e., the budget deficits of the communities.
The greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and eingermaßen under control.
A real time bomb is the budget deficit of communities.
Many mayors in order but revenue from tax, levies and bank credit other sources of investment, often foolhardy Bond, through its halls in excess indebted.
In recent years, they succeeded, the debt by massive selling shares of energy and other networks in the train of privatization of state had received pay.
Now, the source said grinding to a halt.
As far as we are only at official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy for several years, as the rest of the world is going through a period of the ČSSD vaunted sponsors.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments, public finances in order.
Instead, these governments indebted to the state of even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have spent much more sensible than our republic.
This is a great shame, mainly the previous governments.
We are among the countries which, on a global scale, the least of poverty are threatened.
A nassiven programmes, which are unfortunately just in the last few years in cleaning up unnecessarily were blown out.
Even if it succeeded in achieving a part of the nonsensical populist spending, which this year before the elections were adopted, it is clear that in the near future to an increase in the retirement age and a pension reform, then ends virtually any policy in this country, and regardless of who is in power, he will remain a purely run.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that officials from ruling politicians, which is the largest portion of tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year's budget is not a revolution, but can only the sweeping Pflichtausgaben normal expenditure.
The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would have been quite superfluous in previous governments in the last ten years had spent only.
If we do not want it really comes down to that ruling politicians mere administrators, then we have to be patient and not too strong coalition government, but which are aware that the state is just so much to spend, as he in taxes and fees to occupy the calm in preparing further reform laws.
Only they allow a gradual implementation of a balanced budget.

Banks want nobody
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly combat the crisis on the financial markets.
There are more than 100 billion dollars through to the währungsmärkte auction.
In these auctions auction banks interest rates, to which they are prepared to give each other to lend money.
For example, the American Federal Reserve sends 40 billion dollars at auction, a further 24 power for the European and the Swiss central bank.
It is after the attacks of September 11th was the first time that the central banks of various countries on such a coordinated approach to stave off or alleviate the effects of a financial crisis.
"This step is the greatest difficulties, the economy is growing lack verfügbarem free capital, which can give the banks," wrote in a report for his customers Baumohl Bernard by the consultancy Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks, the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 % to 50 %," Baumohl said in his report.
The banks have bedienter on loans for $60 billion lost, especially in the United States.
Analysts are milliardenverluste.
"' The central banks have had really afraid of what else to do but to this action with determination," said the chief economist at ABN Amro, from Kieran Davies.
"It would appear that the situation is really bad," he said.
The central banks have feared that if the banks themselves difficult access to loans for their customers even more expensive loans.
This would reduce the consumption and the American economy into a recession, possibly with the impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called Libor, the London bank, the geldverleih between banks.
This means that the banks had constant fear of each other to borrow money, despite the fact that the central banks in the United States, Canada and Britain during the autumn lowered its interest rates several times.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction of interest rates," said Salvaggio Greg Tempus Consulting the Reuters news agency.
Some analysts believe that it aufheizung the central banks to the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the immobilienmarktes case in the United States.
Klaus: debates the ecologists is quite incredible
Global climate change damage allegedly developing countries most.
President Vaclav Klaus' return to the issue of global warming.
The criticism was now on the drawing to the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where his book "a blue, not a green planet" that he tells us that the debates of the ecologists quite incredible.
Klaus, not just the structure of the conference unacceptable, a strange mixture of public officials and by non-governmental organizations, misunderstood, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompany them, and the reality.
"The debate unstrukturiert is there, it is a Wortfeuerwerk that only a substitute for a real solution to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech president said at the launch of his book that the issue is very important to him and that is so committed.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book in the German translation of credentials, because "I often on caricatures of my views."
Now that interested parties could read, and undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he had not klimatologe, but he said that in his view, adequate conditions for such a book to write.
He was finally academics, capable, professional pamphlets to understand and to judge have experience with statistics and economist, too.
The main thrust of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing, and that his changes therefore quite natural that it on global warming is not being the consensus among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes not too big and seriously and thus are not a threat, and that the efforts, the development of climate, useless, ineffective and unacceptable expensive.
Additionally, he is someone with the experience with Sytemen totalitarian, unacceptable, other unproven views on it, see it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Answering questions from here, he said repeatedly that he was not against "a sound environment, but against öko-aktivisten militants who do not take account of the relationship between effort and reward."
On the same issue Klaus in Vienna had been two months ago - in the Hayek-Institut.

Polívka was Walachei his kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the brand "kingdom of Walachei."
The judge at the district court in Ostrava, although he has as a first, the name "Walachischer King", but the project in longtime work had Tomáš a team to Harabiš in conjunction with the actor.
Polívka began today in the negotiations.
His lawyer, the matter but probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team Bolek in the Polívkas parasitär popularity," said Polívkas after the trial lawyer.
All were in the Walachisches Kingdom ',' the actor and comedian.
The same believe, is Harabiš.
" We have a nearly 10-year work behind us.
Fund-raising and concepts of activities, " he said.
According to him, is the point of dispute over money.
" After years you have noticed that the project is successful and that you could have something out of it.
They want parasitär in our work, " he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachischer king" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, krönte Radoslav him the actors' Brzobohatý.
But then this was not the intention, a fiktives kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the idea that walachische passports.
From an original facetious action emerged clearly from a business and entrepreneurial activity, Harabiš then with the establishment of the Walachisches Kingdom "table."
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and even offered their owners reductions for the visit he and his Theatervorstellungen farm.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also led Harabiš to the mere idea of Polívka, used in the broadcast on Manege " for his entrepreneurial intentions publicized.
"The popularity of Polívkas has project of the walachischen kingdom helped safe," said the judge.
But they added that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were intensely devoted to him.
The cooperation of this fractious parties lasted until the year 2000, Harabiš and Vsetín Polívka in for the formal culmination.
But since Polívka began and Harabiš between the disputes are concentrated in removal 'King Boleslavs I. elected until indefinitely.'
The leading role, Harabišs then Jarmila at the behest of Šuláková as the Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka was Harabiš then against and his company filed the suit, which prompted the court today.
Clarity in the dispute Harabiš could up the competition for the throne and half a princess.
It is a new king.
Details and a date he did not yet.
" We do not want to übereilen.
It should be something Königsumzug like the Walachei.
The king was for a time to be elected.
MR Polívka can register calm, " Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 test VTi SW 1.6 Voruteile are:
To tell the truth, I was never a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
His Fahreigenschaften were not much value, the quality of today, the management and the processing, you could describe as somewhat below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207 in the market, which is so much better.
The Kombi called SW is still a bit, and it only remains for me to change my mind.
When I Hatchback the classic the 207 had tested, I have had to, for example, through Kopffreiheit low Hintersitzen to complain.
These complaints, there is now no longer because of the Kombi if the is such that Zweimetermänner are not.
Soon further
The interior decorating, I am only briefly in order not to repeat.
It is a very successful design, where I try to just because of the Mitteltunnels reservations.
Here, a little more designerische building, where the car would be an so elegant impression.
The seat is convenient, and gone are the times where we may be about to brief seats and head restraints, complaining.
The Seitenhalt has 206 improved considerably.
With regard to the space is concerned, we can make the enlarged dimensions.
The Kombi is also the mentioned lack of Kopffreiheit.
Trunk in the boot
The main thing in this car, however, is thrown into ships' holds.
The I need (for aufklappbaren Rückfensters), beladbar than very good and platzsparend.
The hohlräume Haltegurten equipped with a perfect compromise.
You are not auseinanderziehen, and even heavier objects.
But do we know about the ladevolumen.
It is under the table in the basic structure of 428 litre, as compared to the competition a rather ordinary is worth.
But not in comparison with the Czech Republic top-selling vehicle this category of Fabia, the Škoda Combi.
If we have the 207 SW with the new generation of products from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot clear signs of 52 litres.
For Auslandsurlaub or a Kinderwagens loading, this value is already critical.
The Positiva, however, I have yet to Umklappen the following the rücksitze of very shallow thrown into ships' holds or even the very low Ladekante.
120 PS in four rows
Our Testwagen with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor was with cubic capacity 1.6 litre and a performance by 88 KW.
And, quite frankly, 1600-Kubik-Motor should be Familien-Hatchback, one.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and prefers leash.
When I saw him with his Škoda counterpart to compare the sometimes seems as though his auspuff with a rag blocked, then I can only be impressed.
The price list written speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly volkstümlich.
But we must remember that we are a well-funded car Innneren with a geräumigen and a very good engine have tested.
The basic price of cars with the 1400er putting amounting to 329900 kroner is still on.
With this engine is the cost of 410900 kroner from what is quite a lot.
The Testwagens proposes Premium of again with 80000 an extra Sweden kronors annually.
We had, however, Kopfairbags automatic air conditioning, Scheibenwischerauslösung, mechanical, electrical fensterheber and back and...
So that costs a total 531900 cars less kronor.
That is a lot, but expect the increase they once a Fabia together and they are in a very similar sum.
Then the decision, which brand to be chosen.
Integration Slovak pupils at British schools will not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe, and the local fears about the future development of the local education system.
The integration of East Europeans have yet to meet a number of obstacles.
British schools even cases, where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants of violence is increasing.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the clashes between the indigenous and Slovak immigrants tended to increase.
Quarrels, persecution, Raufereien among schoolchildren have on relations between the parents.
The situation has already so far developed that the police in Chatham, a Slovak woman being arrested a ten-year young boys with a Eisenstange had beaten.
The accused, defended the young with racist insults offended.
The police also applied for an attack two under-age girls to a Slovak immigrants.
The girl to the man who had allegedly racist remarks and him with stones at them.

When I told him he should bewarf stop us with apples and pears and entblößte to be Gesäß, " described a mother Slovak pupils of the newspaper The Times another unpleasant incident.
Complaints have come from both sides.
One of the local has called the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe, even as a struggle to survive.
The specific cases show that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools increasingly tense.
In Britain, 70000 Slovaks, came here looking for jobs.
Some 30000 Slovak students, visiting British schools.

May Havana, particularly his eldest part, strong decrepit, nowhere to be found around so many wonderful colonial beautiful sights as it is here.
Other locations are being herausgeputzt, for example, Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism is essential means of money, there was for this development has given the green light.

Trinidad
An ancient city shortly after the Spaniard had invaded the island, was established.
Fame and wealth, the trafficking of slaves and sugar.
The wealth represented in the schmucken beauty of the small town.
The Spanish Kolonialarchitektur, deeply influenced by the subsequent French settlers, 400 years since hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray-Gebirge, is such a remote place that it still there in the 1950s, of the last century, there was no street by the region with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped it has gone unheeded.
Nothing has been built there, but that does not come down, and everyone was happy that he a roof over their heads.
If you for Trinidad more than one afternoon time, it is interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Ancón Playa Beach, or "Valley of sugar factories."

For Teddybären a name, there was now a court in Khartoum.
After indication of her lawyer, the British teacher in Sudan for insulting to Islam, was charged on Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent deportation.
The British was accused of six- or seven-year pupils to, a Teddybären the name of Mahomet, although any portrayal of the Islamic prophet is banned.
They had it deserves, ausgepeitscht.
After parents of schoolchildren kultusministerium on several occasions complained in Sudan, 54-jährige Grundschullehrerin was in the Unity High School was operating in Khartoum Sunday at home and under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insult to Islam.
Indeed, this case began in September, when the teacher the six- or seven-year pupils on a name for the Klassenteddy to select.
 Children are eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , Boules, Robert head teachers reported.
Finally, as the class to vote, choosing 20 of 23 children Mohammed as favourite first names.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a in Sudan very common first name.
The children have a book for the class, with the photograph of the bears, bildunterschrift and  of Muhammad, my name is .
The Bear even bore no shield with this name, but the problem is simply that the portrayal of the Muslim prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim member of Gillian Gibbons, at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew them well, and they would never have had done something, making it a religious faith to offend,  my only regret is that children has asked for a name  to vote, in his view, this is just a   innocent mistakes.
An opinion which many school teacher, who  this very sensitive to  their pupils and a  person who never in the class  talk about religion.
It should be noted that the first name, Mohammed at the same time in Great Britain Zweitname two main thrust is, for which the English 14 different Schreibweisen exist.
This often from Muslim families selected forename is regarded as a kind of reverence for the prophet (he is the eldest of a family there).
But what are the rules in relation to to use that Vornamens?
We must, for example, a toy?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.

He does so in his capacity as front-runner of United Russia, the Pro-Kreml-Partei, which is a huge victory.

What role will Putin following March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia, the government and president will?

And the Verwaltungselite is the status quo: 65 governors (85 Regionsvorsitzenden), Russia, the local lists of United Russia.
The new, from the West coming freedoms are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.

The officials also makes the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Planning and other arrests close in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer, Juan Morales accused the suspicion of the earlier this week, städtebaulicher discovered case corruption.
Cadena, according to the SER was the  favorite advocate of , and thus privileged members Juan Morales from the residence of his client because important piece of incriminating documents have been arrested in the plot connected.
Other sources added reports Auftragszahlungen of the alleged galizisches Morales at a construction company, the conclusion of an urban treaty that were in the building of a 200 hectares of large area was decided.
There are currently eight people in custody.
Bono agreed to this proposal, the candidature of the PSOE in Toledo and, in case of a victory in Congress.
The former Defense Minister Jose Bono has the offer by the government and the secretary general of the Socialists, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, adopted, it will react to the list of PSOE-Kandidaten in the next general election in Toledo and make that an election victory for the Socialists, the office of kongresspräsidenten.
This is the Organisationssekretär Jose Blanco, the PSOE and Bono at the press conference announced today in the headquarters after the party held a meeting with Zapatero took place.
According to the government, the supply of the former minister justified, since it  in politics, it is important to the best able to count   and Bono among the best .
Furthermore, the originating from the La Mancha politicians in the case of a victory for the Socialists in the forthcoming elections  apparently  as chairman of the congressional candidate for the party.
Bono would kongresspräsidenten Manuel Martín than that for the last 15 November announced in the next general election, not to his career in public policy and Instead in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to acknowledge that the state since his resignation, two years ago in his return to political events have pushed.
Moreover, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President, denied to the people, who in an election victory for the post of kongresspräsidenten would take over, and described it as a   act of transparency.
If he does take office, he hopes in a  lower house of respect and not insult or  diatribe, it  the citizens is similar to .
It is  from time to time the impression that the only place where, in Madrid not calm and relaxed can talk of Congress; for the state Senate of up to 26 times suspended. 
At the same time, he praised the current President  Manuel Martin and  his good work and suggested that he would not give the impression that the office already is, because of its political adversaries otherwise  arrogance that  would call.
Klimapropaganda
Since the klimadebatte both the skeptics of climate change, as well as those who are in the social and political debate in the foreground, a merciless criticism, the movement as a whole - a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement which, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, the fight against climate change as more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even suggests, to design a  new contract with the planet .
This proposal will make him Erklärungsnot in on the action, Nicht-Handelns and his government, which has played a decisive role in that Spain within the EU at the top of the countries which meet the Kioto-Protokolls least fulfilled.
Who is responsible for noncompliance with the rules on which sectors is this and why his administration has the  contract with the planet  had proposed, this development is not stopped.
Moreover, it has now been forced, the citizens of Spain, which he planned operations against climate change, without warning.
The companies will be affected by this kind of behaviour of the citizens should be changed, the individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and the economic consequences.
More specifically, those who are victims, and to save the planet will pay.
However, there and in the future there will be no such statements.
Precisely because it is Aufopfern and the pay for it.
Because the measures against climate change can be used in real terms, are unpopular.
They are kostenreich, troublesome and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the Benzin-Cent proposed by the PSOE Zapatero wahlstrategisch seen seemed so dangerous that he felt obliged to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences to save.
With impressive words, commissions and committees, protocols and new posts.
With its contracts with the world, the other campaigns as appropriate politician neither speeches, yet still demand, but Instead of challenging edition, the meeting and his pad and goodness no other.
But this can only happen if the treaty does not lose its purely virtual in nature and therefore also differs does not claim that the bicycle in the future single travel, or we just erfrischen with a range.

What insurance is for me the best?
The car insurance, which caused the driver potential disaster, which implies a high cost wiederrum, whose size depends on several factors, including by age, gender, date of the creation of a driving licence, family status, kind of insured cars and use, etc.
Owning a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find suitable motor insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell.
First of all, a clear, what we are dealing with.
A take is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders.
This agreement is going through a versicherungsvertrags in writing, which specifies that the society versicherungsprämie agreed and ABN obliged with a Abfindungssumme action disaster.
The versicherungsprämie is the price of insurance, which is made by several factors, including age, gender, date of the creation of a driving licence, family status, kind of insured vehicle or use.
The insurance companies, their prices, according to the statistics, so to a higher risk of higher contributions are payable.
For this reason, both about celebrating as well as women less contributions because, statistics show that these groups, thanks to their caution in a minor accident rate.
The same goes for married people, since these, according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that companies tend to fewer accidents as single.
The benefits will be placed on the vehicle, the frequency of the dangers and the likelihood of an accident.
More common use, the more likely the damage.
In the preparation of the insurance Premium must a number of points.
For this reason, the drivers must carefully study the situation to select the take his personal needs most.
We lists at this point, the main items on which the selection of insurance would have to consider, not just a performance, but also a preisorientierte choice.
Under the 25-year meeting on the choice of low-cost insurance to many obstacles, such as the  rewarding driving experience and which young  licence.
Even if it is an ideal insurance would be best, a Vollkaskoversicherung, there are cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers Vollkasko can choose to cover, so the Vollkaskoversicherung machines are covered, but at a low price.
This type of treaty means that the customer a fraction of the damage caused by the amount even pay.
For  before the Treaty and on the basis of the versicherungsprämie levels. This is higher the smaller bezahlende amount to , said Luis Noguera, main exponents of Spain in first Vermittlungsunternehmen Europe, a Online-Versicherungen for.
Another option is the enlarged insurance, the customers against external damage, but not against the car damage incurred.
Furthermore, this type of insurance theft, fire, and Fahrzeugverlust.
A council.
If you are under 25 years old are, it is in your hands, to reduce the cost of insurance; increases your credit advice, by versuchst to drive carefully and accidents.
A credit advice is a reduction in the basic with the insurance company.
On the contrary, includes a Strafzahlung to an increase in the tariff.
 The amount of credits and total penalty depend on the society and its earnings.
If the company ertragsreiches a year behind us, can afford Bonus-Zahlungen, , to increase Noguera explained.
Once the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude an agreement. Reason is the fact that with increasing rewarding driving experience the accident rate is falling.
So it is best to Vollkaskoversicherung for one with excesses.
 Usually can do not benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of the , not as Vorsteher as the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr occur after the ,  fear of the Anfängers was obtained.
Nevertheless, it is a married customers, not children possess a Vollkaskoversicherung wiser. But only, of course, if the financial situation of the person in question also allows.
From the insurers are couples with children as customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low their contributions come from.
In this case is Vollkaskoversicherung with a cover (for a sum to 300 euros) the best option. In the case that a high credit advice has been received, is an expanded insurance, the only the third Fahrzeugjahr.
 They go as a whole should be more relaxed and have more purchasing power, allowing them to pay a larger , Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is Vollkaskoversicherung, one with excesses (for a sum to 150 euros), or an expanded insurance, who got a sufficiently high credit advice.
Ultimately you have to Bear in mind that the take something very important, not only because they are the drivers against possible damage, but also because of high costs, require that a thorough selection, our personal situation.

New concerns about Erdgasstreit between Russia and Ukraine
A new Preisstreit brewing between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to western Europe.

The arrests were a "Medienzelle" of 16 from Medina, which it was based on the " Takfiri thinking " - to promote the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, violence against Muslims support, the infidels and disloyal gebranntmarkt.
Among those arrested were 32 people who have been accused of the militias of financial assistance.
The atmosphere of Venus could offer a glimpse of the future of the earth Show
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data on a European raumschiffes orbit to demonstrate that a abgewandten the planet zwilling the Earth is still more than was previously understood.
Venus planetarische is the näheste neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds have roughly the same size and Planetenbahnen have similar, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago had Venus conditions that are very similar to those on Earth, and would have been even livable, scientists believe today.
But because of rampant Kohlendioxid-Treibhauseffektes, the erosion of the atmosphere with the sun and Rotationstempo slower Venus, gave a very different entwicklungskurs.
Today is the Planet of water and a heiss temperature, which is enough to melt lead by Hurrikan-starken winds and Blitzstürmen were devastated.
The findings of the spacecraft went Venus Express the European Space Agency, the planned for a year has investigated, provide a sobering look at how the planet in view of the catastrophic climate change could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor of the physics department at the University of Oxford, one of the head of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is clear why the climate at Venus so different to the earth, while the planet, otherwise we are pretty much the same."
"Our new data, it will be possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus billions of years ago as the Earth has begun, possibly with a bewohnbarer environment."
"Enriched uranium" of the police seized
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police seized.
A Polizeisprecher said that three people were arrested and that the material is being examined.
He confirmed whether or not it is enriched uranium, but said that 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds) would be sold.
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he is not worthy of a presidential Schneemann, to be consulted.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally ready to take part in a debate on Youtube in the ordinary voters questions on video and submit them to the candidates.
None of the issues on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were raised so ridiculously as the Schneemann, the Democrats on global warming in the Youtube debate the other party.
But the questions and the answers reflected this time, the State of the Republican Party in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN, which mitunterstützten the debate, the would be zeigenden to Youtube Clips tell.
But in the first half hour of debate, the longest the one issue that has been devoted to immigration in the heart.
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of hybrid electorate a dials, if you heard things they liked, the company said leaders of the approval than the candidates strict control over the borders of languages.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening between Rudy Giuliani was the national champion, and Romney, who is in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has moved forward.
Giuliani shackles tried the reputation that he was soft on illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.
He was attacking Romney in the former governor of Massachusetts accused, illegal immigrants for work on his house to have stopped.
The two, particularly formidable apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates an "amnesty" (the illegal regular status and the opportunity for citizenship would be) support.
Lesser candidates, like Duncan Hunter kongressabgeordneter, a kalifornischer, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, has been able to raise them on this issue.
None of the two men has serious chances for the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they used and harder than other Immigrationspauke being.
At least in the area of immigration parts the candidates basically the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, combined with fears over toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help the Republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives to forget or.
But the debate has been clearly problematic than other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he has Waffenrestriktionen in the past supported.
JOHN MCCAIN and Romney debated whether simuliertes drowning as torture should be considered.
A questioner asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.
This meant that Giuliani, arguing that although the Bible his favored book, the story of Jonah and the Europe may not be literally believe.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, now, contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was pressed whether Jesus they would be in favour of lachte, he said, and Jesus was too smart minding office.
The chase is exceptionally wide open.
Huckabees rise in Iowa coincides with Spendenerfolgen Ron Paul's latest and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate by Wednesday.
These two are hochgeschossen from nothing, because the two wing of the party has yet to be one of the better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, the party of a candidate from the outset and convincing together with winning a message about the grandeur of America and a Zwinkern on both Wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The labour pains
Gordon Brown has yet another hineinfallen discovered the hole; its way out of this game will remain the same.
For British scandals, the schlüpfrig does not.
Seem a title held by any politician, sold Hotelrechnungen in Paris not having paid gelutscht cloves.
But the revelation that a rich businessman donations for Britain's governing Labour Party on more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name disguised by other people, and that the party failed to live up to that, is something without which the disputed territory of Gordon Brown would be well managed.
As two months ago the prime minister of the demand for an election from dämliche had the intelligence of British insulting, by stating that opinion polls this decision had not influenced, there was hope that a robust and efficient government would offer.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly Vertretungsvorsitzende clever, the Liberal Democrats, said, once the most dreaded Brown by Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The heavy-handed rescue of Northern Rock, a wounded bank showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under siege.
Ill-conceived proposals to change the tax code, business groups against the government.
The steuerbehördliche loss of personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative pick.
A trio of retired generals launched an insurgency in the House of Lords in protest at cuts in spending: minister of the armed forces, they said, is a teilzeitjob.
Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and your former Erfüllungsleiter) is already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably direction departure.
Nevertheless, governments can a turning point, after which they find it impossible to govern.
Neither may still have confidence people politicians, but they usually keep their scepticism, if a new force takes office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister, the situation improves, and they need not even a long time is this postponement: public service begins leaking; the cabinet ministers chatting start; the press is looking for bad news, and the government is defensive and no ambition.
In a way that is the position of Brown is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders cannot claim a new broom.
He likes to Tony Blair would deny he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen, for example, hang together with decisions that Brown as chancellor of the Finance Ministry.
And even if not directly was involved in Blair's mishaps - as in the long "money for title held by" study of political parties, the voters may be working on the assumption that he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The errors are not quite as horrible as the conservative they describe.
Like Mr. Bean, nobody died or has beschwindelt altogether.
And the antidote, painful as they may be, is deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies are promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new song and dance about political donations is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams, its donations, with its charitable gifts, he says, comparing wish no public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision was not for him.
The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear, and they exist in a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he should have known by Abrahams agreement, but not that it is illegal, of course, some questions, just as Mendlesohn Jon, Labour's Hauptfinanzeintreiber, on the odd donations have been told in October.
But so far, Brown is not included: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of this confusion, although most of the payments after he took office in June.
To date, the prime minister half the job.
He has quickly the violation of the law by his party, but he watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry conducted on the subject, to complete the picture, a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons learned" not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that there are other things which Mr. Brown must be done, as something of a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, to find vacant for six months, and move forward with a drastic reform of political parties.
The dignity of the hard-liners of the labour demand with the conservative to collaborate and possibly the special financial relationship with the unions, bitter tablets for a party members such as Mr. Brown.
But he should have some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory, is unquestionable probity and solid competence.
Kartenhaie
The Kreditkartenmarkt America's credit crisis?
If blood in the water, it is, of course, Rückenflossen herumwirbeln that criticism.
Now that America's ailing real estate market, have Kreditkartenmarkt the Predators in the attack.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs are counting on the Kreditkartenverluste 99 billion dollars could achieve, if the risk of infection from under-funded loans to other forms of Verbrauchenkrediten.
Signs of tension is evident.
There have been increases in both the Ausbuchungen and Säumnisraten in the proportion of loans, einziehbar each No or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC has announced last month that they have a 1.4 billion dollars charging Verbraucherfinanzierungen for their American, partly because of the Kreditkartennehmern weakness of.
Nevertheless, it is too early to panic.
Losses and Säumnisse are still low.
According to the rating agency Drittquartals-Säumnissrate Moody was 3.89 % of nearly a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the advice is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American Privatinsolvenzrechtsgesetzen in 2005 led to a sharp fall of Konkursanmeldungen, which in turn a Keditkartenverluste large proportion of the population; the number of applications (and thus Säumnisgebühren) would return, whether the general conditions to deteriorate borrowers or not.
The industry also reports on solid Zahlungsraten to show how much of their debt each month, consumers abbezahlen
And confidence in kreditkartenbasierte securities is quite strong, despite the immobility in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research companies, calculated that the Ausgabemengen for 2007 will ultimately be 25 % higher than last year.
Direct Infektionskanäle between the Immobilienkreditkrise and the Kreditkartenmarkt, there is no doubt that it is likely that consumers Kreditkartenschulden include Eigenheimkredite, now that dry up.
But the issuers of cards look at the money Kapitalwerte Instead, so Hauspreise is empowered to resolve not necessarily a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
You can even for the issuers of cards.
The incentives for consumers, the hypothekenraten will continue to fall when the assets are worth more than the value of the loan; as a result, Kartenschulden are among the Rückzahlungsprioritäten important.
Issuers of cards can also much faster and more flexible as a lender to the stürmischeren conditions respond by seizing interest rates or kreditgrenzen.
This should, in theory, the risk of rapid revaluation of assets.
"We will wake up one day and the loans completely re-evaluate," says Gary Perlin, Hauptfinanzreferent Capital ones.
Even if Unterdeckungskrise in a sudden Kreditkartenmarkt is unlikely, there are the risks of a sustained downturn much real.
Hauspreise if lower and a Kreditminderung America into recession will push the industry is facing a grimmigeren future.
Do you think further afield for these fins.
British bänker offences committed in the Enron case
Three British bankers, for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Hauptfinanzleiter of Enron, Andrew Mr. Fastow, face trial on Wednesday, changed their requests in guilty.

Verpfuschte operation is believed in death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Erntedankfest than Ronald Livingston great Glasfenster of just a little Healthier restaurants in this case, and watched as an ambulance at the White Cape Cod two doors down from the West Scott lasted Avenue.
Soon, Polizeiauto was there.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw Kastenwagen of the Leichenbeschauers hands," said a aufsichtsperson Livingston of restaurants, on Wednesday.
"That was the point, as I knew someone died."
The authorities said that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant Newarker of the director of the Polizeidezernats.

The authorities have still not been established what Mrs Arroyos death, and that toxokologische investigations, the results for weeks, could be available to help investigate a mysterious death of a Führungspitze mourning by the Newark Police has broadcast.
Mrs Arroyo since September 2006 was Polizeidirektors an intern, Garry F. Mccarthy, and her voice was many in the department.

The shares native yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after Markthoffnungen that the central bank will want the Kreditmärkte by additional cuts to be reassured by vizevorsitzenden reassuring comments from the US central bank were strengthened.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said that the policy of "flexible and pragmatic" on the ongoing pressure in the financial markets.
In a clear effort sullen to reassure markets in view of Kreditspannungen signs of emerging, said Kohn, the recent turbulence had "partially some of the improvement in the Marktfunktionen from the late part of the September and October."
The increased unrest caused should remain in place, would make the possibility of a further tightening of monetary conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were made by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and with fresh injections in the US markets and possible further rate cuts to stabilize the lending criteria.
The speech also helped Wall Street, with the addition of bad news from the US economy, now that the sale of US-Immobilien a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil, the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, stressed that they 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a measure aimed at reducing will remove heavy losses from its lost in the US-Hypothekenkreditesektor bet.

England faced with a decision on Owais by Bopara and Ravi Shah
Two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who is supposed to be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Bopara Shah or Ravi?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because, Graveney David, Wahlvorsitzende, to call at least at this particular title, is Cheftrainer, Peter Moore's and captain Michael Vaughan and help to decide, and because the table of Morries high, the English managing director with applications to slowly for national Wählerämter fills, if not for what in part-time.
Whoever the sixth Schlägerposition not, will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport, it is certainly.
It is never easy, just want a person, which allows for the top of its berufszweiges, and somebody else never hinauskommt the lowest rank, sometimes because of a lack of good fortune rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket, where the choice is difficult, where decisions are needed, which are at the end of subjective.
It is the right time for Bopara levels?
Is it fair to Shah if it does?
The same can perhaps in another area to be asked whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications, the business familiar, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a cricketers, unless he has the opportunity to be submerged or swim.
Of course, pay a great influence on decisions, but prospects of it.
Within a team needs a cricketers master's eye at the right time, if he can take a Wicket and a bat, regular opportunities in order when he, as a one-day cricketers impression.
The eyes of the Auswähler to catch is more complicated.
There were many who last season better than, for example, when James Anderson, who appears to play in the first test, even if Harmison Stephen themselves as healthy and as the wind in the nets kegelt.
Anderson took Wickets 32 first-class with 33 Runs a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett, only 29 with the same modest average, but both had its high points and hope for more.
Whether Bopara Shah or Asgiriya stage plays in, can only be a Ansichtsfrage.
The election could the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs, however, it was Paul Collingwood at kämpfend to consolidate the breakthrough to a major Testkricketspieler expeditions and even though he was a double hundred against Australia in punktete Australia, perhaps still undervalued.
Probably that Graveney is, Vaughan and Moore's, after a further discussion within Netzsitzung of Asgiriya today in stage its conservative instincts and bauchgefühl Shahs for greater experience of Boparas youthful enthusiasm will follow.
There are arguments for both.
For funkelnden Shah says his Test-Debüt-Innings and valuable 88 in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds, and only six of the Bopara, with 22 years is seven years younger, and their angedrehtes record against bullets.
But Shah only 10 Runs in his two Innings in May against West Indies on the test in Lord, its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus its immediate rejection of the Auswählern as Vaughan healthy was his position for the next game seems to reverse the momentum from his proposal, which was obviously in Mumbai.
By contrast, the Alleskönner schaufelweise appetite for Essex.
He is nothing Kricketplatz impressed on a remote and its attitude, it was to come to the point, when he recently Vierradantrieb a car with an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen in rapid succession.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was his Vodafone gesponsort (of course), Teamkollegen; and his to Alastair Cook who watched from afar and enthusiasm to say: " Have you seen this? '.
Bopara is Feldspieler a much better kegelt, Mitteltempo be here with some effect on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and proposes with confidence and skill.
The right man to vote is one thing, the right moment to select a different.
Perhaps this is the real art of choice.

Buses are refugees back to work, and in order to combat al
The first Busladungen Iraqi refugees from Syria came yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of refugees, whose funds or Visas expired and others, who hoped that the city to normality.
Some were even back in order to combat the rebels them out of their homes.
Mansour on brought before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official Regierungskonvoi from a dozen bus terminal, was the betriebsam with refugees from Syria and Jordan, who in Privattransporten were returned.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors in Baghdad killed 'Sabah' has," said Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on the television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and now it is guaranteed."
They say that the Mahdi Army have ceased to kill, " he said, in relation to the Schiitenmilizen of the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, has ordered his forces back at this time.
Al Atwani Qassim, a 38-jähriger Shiite teachers from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children back, because his Syrian visa did not renew and because the regime Iraqis are not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah telephoned him to say that a local, supported by the United States Militia contributed to Al Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital, and to urge him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite think from his home in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by a grenade attack had been expelled after his fellow citizens to combat Al-Qaeda's had urged.
He was to return to fight.
" Two days ago telephoned me some of my friends and have told me that they Anti-Al-Qaida-Miliz in the Sleikh began and that you have my support and that of my young need.
That is why I have returned Sabaah, " said Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many spoke that, by increasing calm in the capital since the US-Truppenerhöhung and the growth of local "groups concerned citizens" had been enticed by armed and in cooperation with the American military to defend their neighbourhoods.
But more mentioned by home Visumsprobleme and dwindling funds had been forced in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis in recent years.
Al-samarrai Dar-es-Salam, a 51-jähriger dreimaliger father, said the general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, the Syrian government had asked Visumbeschränkungen for refugees, people to return.
More than two and a half million people are probably of the sectarian death squads have fled the country.
"We did well to al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis no longer issuing Visas to allow them to return to Iraq to force them," said the Sunni pensioners.
"I don't trust the government, which supports the criminals, my house burned down, having way."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places, where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees sectarian tensions will stir up again and it conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
Is the smallest province of vocational training and its leader, even with the international focus its universities.
In only one Saarländer embodies the world the same deficit as the rest of the country.

The combinations of vocational and academic training are relatively strong.

Despite the practical training and rising demand, the number of Ingenieurabsolventen in recent years, however, has fallen by a third.
The saarländische has therefore the university department of marketingkampagne now for ingenieurwissenschaftliche subjects.
Mr. President, "to the schools after the first PISA study a number of reforms," said a spokeswoman of the Ministry of Education.
So, the government comparative tests nationwide.

In Pisa receded in 2003, the proportion of Risikoschüler from 29 to 20 percent.
A total of whipped up the Saar, however, not as strong as other Federal Länder.
The Bavarians expecting better.
And Saarländer to the anger of the Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured in Pisa, in this area could otherwise points.
Because the language of the neighbors is in high schools duty - Saarländer if not French.

Venus is zwilling the Earth a hellish
Venus, despite their lebensfeindlichen is the Earth's atmosphere than previously thought, the European spacecraft went "Venus Express" lightning in the atmosphere and Windwirbel in Poland, as winter on the earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists suspect that it blitzt on Venus.
Now, the European probe "Venus Express" proven - they sensed electromagnetic waves on the fringes of the atmosphere at: the lightning on Venus shooting at a rate of about 56 miles from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the journal " nature. "
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theorie" lightning life on Earth: storm give rise to reactions in the ocean have suggested the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so at Venus: "If ever there was live there, it must have been very early history," said Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Now it seems on the surface of Venus barely alive: the atmosphere, around one hundred times denser than on the ground, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the Teufelszwilling of the earth, but it is a zwilling," said Russell.
Why the Venus, the earth in mass and size similar, such an entirely different development has taken is Esa-Mission of the issue.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-Forschung, since the beginning of the 1990s no probe more specifically to study the planet was away.
The latest research, now entering a number of "-Artikeln" nature will stress, according to the researchers are not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the Nachbarplaneten of common ground with the earth are bigger than first thought," shares the ESA.
For example, the researchers in addition to the already well-known on North Pole whirlwind Wolkenstrudel on a Südpol, which is still significantly faster.
) The phenomenon is reminiscent of luftströme Winterhemisphäre on the abasing worldly, wrote in a research team headed by the Italian Piccioni Giuseppe Di Astrofisica Spaziale process of Cosmica Fisica e..
The zweitinnerste planet of the solar system was almost exactly the same as the Earth and is in diameter 12.100 kilometres almost as great.
Morgen- also called Abendstern or called planet revolving around 225 days, just under the sun.
He turns but much slower themselves Venustag: a Erdentage 243 lasts.
Although the Venus with sea-surface temperatures of 460 degrees and a pressure from 92 bar hardly reminiscent of the Earth, researchers claim that both planet under similar conditions.
On both there has been a water on the Earth was in oceans, Venus but in space.
And while carbon dioxide at the Earth at Karbonatgesteinen, power is fixated on Venus the bulk of the atmosphere.

In what country lives this chancellor?

But in the realm of Angela cloud are domestic problems with a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty and the concerns of lower-paid?
A few Nebensätze was left.
It is typical of how often they are promises, and Kinderzuschlag it.
It's three times, Merkel needs is a fairly precise phrase publishing.

The founding fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's Supergruppe musiziert in the 1970s: Bandmitglieder of the three Harmonia Konsolen took her during a concert in Berlin again.
The Mitschnitt seems a distinct revival from their big time "live in 1974."
Even then, they were much celebrated abroad.

The musiziert Harmonia band again, has, under Krautrock-Liebhabern for some excitement.
Although opinions may reveal: targeted enquiries revealed the name Popgedächtnis while schwirrte through collective, but not so strongly in this band for 32 years to painful.
But why should not the German his living legend from the 1970s to celebrate?
Given what Krautrock is misleading in England and America has always been more than in our own country.

Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
"The hunting party" and " murderous peace deal again two films with the Balkan war.
But both are not convincing.
Either the approaches to Geballer action, or they are too sentimental.
There is also Richard Gere in "the hunting party" does not help.
The good news first: while hiding the war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the Bosnien-Krieges gloom hinterland of now, the actor Richard Gere has been recovered.
We had the most beautiful man of the 1980's least lose sight of it because too many nett-belanglose roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism a austrieben appetite for inspection.
Richard Gere is now suddenly was the main argument, " the hunting party - if the gejagten hunters the ' (why filmtitel today have always been so long, and Lokführer-Tarifverträge confusing as perhaps?).
He contributes a wonderfully augenzwinkernde portrayal: basically is his Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt what from Gere could have been if the fate and the cinema would not help: a man, his best times long behind us, but the ruinengleiches statue of himself and his demise considerable vestiges of the former charm trends.
However, despite this Trumpfes, "the hunting party" together with the German production " murderous peace ", which also starts this week, the only Balkankriegs-Filme endless series of failed.
"Murderous peace" can be out: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo Topol (Adrian, Max Riemelt), which is a Serbin before Kosovar sniper salvage what a prompt still in love with them.
Good though it is that this is not the Serbs as the sole source of much misery, fernsehflache loses the film Geballer too quickly and action.
There is a kind of "red for Cobra 11" without the motorway but with war.
This can be seen in "the hunting party" is a textbook case study, why there has never actually Balkan-Kriegsfilm a good.
The history of three US-Kriegsreportern, who Oberkriegsverbrecher the Serb "the Fox," down with another director and another Drehbuchautor (both institutional Richard Shepard) at a different time, perhaps, a new " Apocalypse Now ".
Because the stories are so diverse: both times small teams go into the forest, something that is not what the military can and on both occasions, there will be a trip to the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "the hunting party" is that Simon Hunt not just the ramshackle cynics with heart than us at the beginning.
No, the Script must add to this a romantic affair with a later bosnierin andichten Muslim murdered.
Finally, "the hunting party," the edge when the reporters within the last five minutes Zeitrafferverfahren succeed in what NATO, CIA and Kopfgeldjäger all around the world in five years have failed to catch: the war criminals and Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice at The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik telephone calls.
The film has a very human concerns.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still rumlaufen, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here will they be united once again) the persecution because of undisclosed political agreements not too hard.
But the well-intentioned and evil are sometimes so similar, if a a famous Brecht-Gedicht in the sense.
It says Holzmaske on the Dämons an Asian at the arbeitstisch of the poet: "Compassionate geschwollenen I can see the andeutend Stirnadern,: how tough it is to be evil."
Movies like " the hunting party ' Schwellköpfe is exactly this type, but which indicate how tough it is, well.
The problem is not the Balkankriegsfilms genre of limited.
Recently, it was in this newspaper reports, Irak-Filme hollywoods that all major flops.
You can add: it has also never a good Südafrika-Film.
Almost always, when a star on the hot spots or herumtreibt minefields in the world, that is something the results as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, " Beyond Borders " with Angelina Jolie or " blood diamonds " with Leonardo Dicaprio.
Perhaps all conflicts are still just in time to close.
After all, it had to pass before for decades to Hollywood with "Schindlers list" a good film about the Holocaust could swing.
Some films is probably mature, now known as the Vietnam-Werke Classic in force, "the Deer Hunter," " Apocalypse Now " or " Full Metal Jacket " were so far from unanimous as masterpieces celebrated.
But perhaps we know today, where every slaughter in real time on two screens at home, is simply too much about the conflicts in the world.
And Drehbuchschreibern USA, the Bedenkenlosigkeit, which it needs in order to tell good stories.
"Or otherwise," or " the Great Dictator " after all also are so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know how bad the Nazi regime, really.
Perhaps we should not be good if we want to make good films.
Perhaps it takes Künstlerblick a sarcastic distancing themselves from the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk.
As the parallels between its historical novel Lemprières Dictionary "and the Balkan war was interviewed, he replied:" That is, that some things never change.
Cities are increasingly terrifying dangers, people will always be brutally murdered in appalling and always war in Yugoslavia. "

"Not Hamburg on a Olympiabewerbung decision, but sportbund the German Olympic sports," said Beust world of online.
He was referring to the planned for early December Sportbunds expected decision on an application of Munich for the Winter Games 2001/2018.

It was the dream not for all time ausgeträumt Beust, said of.
Sportbund Hanover (HSB) lamented the statements by Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg in the next 25 years, competing for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to be able to have a chance, with plans already buried at this time HSB-Präsident," said Gunter Ploß on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application also appear to contradict the statement by the Senatschefs during an Empfanges to the General Assembly of the Hochschulsportverbandes general Germans.
There was Beust by Hamburgs the candidatures of 2015 for the Universiade "substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulsportverband had only last week Hamburg nominated as a candidate.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion threw the Senate, valuable time on housing not used in Hamburg.
"Development of the small Grasbrooks by the Senate was delayed for years because he is at the map and Olympia extracting housing," said the SPD St. Vitus Carola Quast and Jan.
While the SPD for the small Grasbrook always integrated planning for Olympia Wohnnutzung and a subsequent have asked that the CDU unilaterally on "Event-Faktor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time, had a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, was in Leipzig failed.
These are not Warhols boxes

Now throw Holzkisten them, manufactured in Sweden Warhols dark shadow over Werkverzeichnis.
A large part of the vierundneunzig Brillo-Boxen listed in the "type of Stockholm" are forgeries.
Once the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen', a few months ago, questioned the Warhols authenticity of Andy Brillo-Boxen of the Year in 1968, stirred up Moderna internal investigations in Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: the six Brillo-Boxes "' that former Museumsdirektor Pontus Moderna Museet Hulthén's that put vermacht in 1995 and are copies - and I think the majority of Brillo-Boxen around one hundred others from the" type of Stockholm, " on the international art market.
The verschachtelt is a puzzling string kuratorischer artistic and production.
1964 Warhol created in New York, his first Brillo-Boxes "Holzkisten," bemalte, rot-blau-weißen at the design of Seifenpulvers cardboard boxes of " Brillo ".
An exhibition of Moderna his work on Museet 1968 was Warhols - with the agreement, hundreds of Brillo-Kisten from cardboard: these were (spurned by Warhol) but were directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik holidays.
It is not works of art, but their role models merely exhibits.
At the same time Warhol 1968 has probably given permission to a few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden to produce, although not issued Moderna Museet.
Eye witnesses are now talking about 15 boxes, then the Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes as authorized by the name of the 'type of Stockholm' right to Auktionsgeschichte and the arts.
Some of them have at auction more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that Museumsdirektor the legendary Pontus Hulthén's misrepresented later said that there are around one hundred Holzkisten 1968 in Sweden produced and issued the Warhol, leaving him then.
Indeed, Hulténs 105 cases in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that point, Warhol was already three years dead.
Lars Byström Chefkonservator Moderna, Museet Saturday, has museumseigenen the six Brillo-Boxes, three from the Swedish privatised, two of whom 1968 produced in Stockholm: their Pressspanplatten grundiert and were abgeschmirgelt, then ölfarbe with a white had brushes.
The structure of the copies from 1990, however, suggests that the colour Malerrolle without a Grundierung directly to the Pressspanplatte imposing - also is not oil, but Acrylfarbe.
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and best of the official list Warhols Brillo-Boxes by Andy removed", Moderna director of Museet, Lars Nittve, said: 'if' the Andy Warhol kind of Authentication board ' in New York to a different conclusion is Moderna, Museet will be the six boxes in his collection Ausstellungsmaterial as copies / classified. "
Back in July, however, has the Authentication board announced that the "serious accusations", the Seifenpulver-Kisten in terms of the collected.
But since then, it remains unerbittliches in silence.
