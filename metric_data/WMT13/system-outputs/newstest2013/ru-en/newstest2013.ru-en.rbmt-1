Republic strategy of the resistance to repeated election of Obama
The leaders of Republicans justified their policy with the need for fight with the falsification on the selections.
However, in the center of Brennana is considered the latter myth, asserting that the cases of falsification on the elections in the United States are more rare than the cases of death from the impact of lightning.
Moreover the lawyers of Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in ten years.
One can be said with the confidence: these new tendencies will have a negative effect on of voter turnouts.
In this sense similar actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
In contrast to Canada the U.S. states bear responsibility for the organization of federal elections to the USA.
For this very reason the majority of the governments of states since 2009 assume the laws, which complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon acquired new scope after the selections in November 2010, which brought 675 new places in 26 states to Republicans.
In one 2011 were as a result only accepted 180 bills, which limit voting rights in 41 state.
New laws about the selections require voter to present identity card with the photograph and proof of the presence of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws shorten the period of early voting, they abolish the right of voter registration during the day of command and take away voting rights in citizens, who have convictions.
To the selections of 2006 not one U.S. state forced voters to present identity card with the photograph.
Indiana became the first state, which introduced a similar requirement.
Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 konstitutsionnost of the law, accepted in Indiana.
_republic authority hurry extend this practice, and, on other state.
For two last years they initiated the bills, which force voters to present identity cards with the photograph, in 34 states.
It is important to note that in contrast to Quebec the American citizens do not have this universal identity card as the card of medical insurance.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., 21 million people, that reached the necessary for the voting age, do not have the identity card with the photograph, given out by the government organ of their state.
Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.
In this case the cost of obtaining the required identity card frequently exceeds one hundred dollars.
New limitations dispropoptionally affect young people, minorities and people with the low level of incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people, which earn it is less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of citizens it is older than 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with the photograph.
But this yet not all.
To students - voters, who, as it is considered, vote for the candidates from the Democrats, in several states it is not permitted to use the identity card with the photograph, given out by their educational institution.
Then the same states permit members of the fishing and hunting clubs, which vote in essence for the Republicans, to use for voting of certification, given out by these clubs.
Until 2004 not one state required the proof of the presence of American citizenship for the voting.
For the first time similar requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011 more than ten states accepted the laws, which require voters to prove that they are the citizens of the USA.
These measures are, obviously, aimed at that in order to limit voting descendants from Latin America.
It is considered that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, republic legislators initiated in 2011 the laws, which abolish voter registration during the day of voting in eight states.
They also limited the right of the individual persons or groups to render aid by the fact, who desires to be registered.
This limitation did not pass without the consequences.
So, for example, during the selections of 2004 campaign on voter registration helped to introduce into the lists of approximately 10 million citizens.
At the same time the measures, accepted since 2009, led to the drop on 17% of level of the registration of new voters in 2010 on the comparison since 2006.
In addition republic legislators accepted in other five states the laws, aimed at shortening of the period of early voting.
Thus, during general election of 2008 in Florida 33% voters, who voted before the appointed time, they were African Americans, although the latter composed only 13% of the total number of voters of state.
The same occurred also with the descendants from Latin America.
Presenting only 11% of voters, they composed 24% of citizens, who voted before the appointed time.
In contrast to the white, which, forming 76% of voters, among those voted before the appointed time composed only 46%.
Certainly, legislator-Democrats and their supporters actively speak against the adoption of the laws, which limit voter registration.
Several projects of laws were vetirovano by governor-Democrats.
The action of the most ambiguous laws was stopped with the interference of the Attorney General of the United States.
This made it possible to partially limit negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of 34 states accepted the laws, which require the presentation of identity card with the photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules, which entered the action will undoubtedly hinder the realization of selective right for the selections of 2012.
Criticisms from the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws, which were accepted, seeing in them obvious directivity to that in order to influence the election results of 2012 in the key states.
The report of the center of Brennana dated 2011 demonstrates, that the states, which accepted these laws, present 171 of 270 voices necessary voters of the necessary in the board in order to win presidential elections.
It is still too early to assert with the confidence that these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have essential influence on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
Only one is undoubted: these new positions will have a negative effect on of voter turnouts.
In this sense similar actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening of cancer of the prostate gland: to pass test or not?
In reality, test to the DOG gives sometimes the erroneous results, lzhenegativnye, and sometimes also lzhepozitivnye, which lead to the useless medical interference.
To men, and so unwillingly passing periodic observation and examination, there is from what to begin to doubt still more.
To pass test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies, carried out in the United States, were observed the numerous cases of infection among the groups of those investigated; therefore obtained data difficult to interpret and it is difficult to manufacture any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, revealed the different level of mortality in those patients, who passed screening, and those, who did not pass it.
This study also showed, after 12-year observation that the probability of appearance metastasis by 30-40% is higher in those, who did not pass screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass test beginning from 50 years, or with 40, if one of the straight relatives had cancer of prostate.
The men of African-American origin are also subjected to the increased risk.
Key moment is making a correct decision, as soon as cancer it is discovered.
Cancer can be both the aggressive and sluggish.
For patient it is necessary to elucidate the degree of the risk of his cancerous illness, proposing to it possible versions, without the required treatment of cancer of prostate, which does not present danger for the life in the long-term outlook, but making selection, in these cases, in favor active observation of the disease.
Today, many men, in which is revealed cancer, will not pass the course of treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not present threat for the life.
We will propose by them active observation, and if disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly more frequent we with the accuracy determine criteria for making of a decision about that, who must or must not pass the course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend the nevertheless passing of test.
But it is important also to consult with its doctor in order to determine, necessary or not to pass this test.
In the collaboration with the international association of urology, Movember created the tool, which makes it possible to estimate all pro and con passages of test to the DOG.

To avoid the disease
Unfortunately, there does not exist miracle-prescription in order to avoid cancer.
In spite of the progress of scientific research, the observance of a healthy way of life remains the best method to decrease the risk of disease.
It is considered that if all people healthily fed and sufficiently they moved, 30% of cases of cancer it would be possible to avoid.
“If no one no longer it smoked, this number would grow as the minimum to 50%”, emphasizes Andre Bole, press-secretary the Canadian association of cancer.
However, according to the estimations, 10% of cases of cancer are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian association of cancer the fight with smoking remains priority, in spite of the decrease of a quantity of smokers.
Smoking is connected with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is the factor of risk for many others.
It brings colossal harm on the health of people.
“Even today in Quebec are counted 1.5 million smokers”, tells press-secretary in Andre Bole.
Encouraging fact: the risk to die of cancer decreases half 10 years after failure of smoking.
Weight
According to given of PENALTIES, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of a disease.
They increase the risk of the appearance of breast cancer, thick and rectum, gullet, pancreas and womb.
“Studies show that the regular physical activity in the course of the entire life protects from cancer large intestine”, they add in the association.
Nourishment
Association also recommends the limiting of the consumption of red meat.
In the too large numbers it increases the risks of the appearance of cancer of the large intestine.
It follows to avoid also sausage articles.
The conservation of meat via smoking, drying or salting, can lead to the formation of cancerogenic substances.
“The latter can damage to the cells of organism and lead to the development of cancer”, they explain in the association.
Vitamins
In recent years many scientists dealt with a study of the influence of vitamin additives on the development of cancer.
But for the given moment it is not possible to name the results of these studies single-valued.
In the opinion of SCC, study of vitamin E give contradictory results.
If one of them showed reduction in the risk of the development of cancer of prostate, then another gave opposite result.
In the evaluation of influence on the development of cancer of vitamin D also there is no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Bole emphasizes that its anxieties and family anamnesis it is important to discuss with the doctor.
“The delivery of analysis does not lead to cancer”.
Higgs's boson in the components
By the past summer communication, that for scientists was, possibly, possible to reveal Higgs's boson, caused present stir - and not without reasons.
It is considered that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, neither much nor is small.
Furthermore, this is the last particle, whose existence was predicted within the framework of the standard model - our best, or, in any case, “least not perfected” of the description of nature and behavior of material, but which earlier could not be revealed experimentally.
But physics yet not to the end they are assured that the discussion deals precisely with Higgs's boson.
We know, without the shadow of doubt that we deal concerning the actually new particle and that she strongly resembles Higgs's boson, forecast by standard model.
Furthermore, new given, represented on this week at one important physical congress in Kyoto, it seems, this they confirm, although for the complete confidence yet it does not obtain some data.
Let us represent nevertheless that the discussion deals with Higgs's boson, since chances to be mistaken seem minimum, and let us look however, that this it means.
There is, in this peace one law completely inevitable, that says, that two things cannot prove to be in one and the same place simultaneously.
To go around this rule there is no opportunity whatever, even do not attempt too zealous, you will otherwise do harm to itself.
But although physics of elementary particles is sufficiently strange peace, occurs that in it also there is one law of the similar nature: the exclusion principle of Pauli, who postulates that two particles cannot occupy one and the same space at one and the same moment of time, if they are in one and the same “quantum state” - this “state” consists, briefly, in some of their characteristics.
On the basis of this, physics divide the particles into two categories.
In one angle, we find respectable citizens, called fermions, which are wisely subordinated to Pauli's principle.
In other fuss the bosons, infamous gang of the anarchists, who do not have respect to nothing - at least for this principle, which means that they can very quietly prove to be in one and the same place simultaneously.
As reports the site (by the way, completely unusual) of Particle Adventure of the laboratory of Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the mesons, about which we here speak will not be, and “the particle of the force”, by means of which are extended basic forces of nature and to which in a certain kind relates Higgs's boson.
These bosons themselves, should be emphasized, not all such exotic essences, as it would be possible to think.
In reality, if you succeed in reading this chronicle, then this because of one is improbable to the commonplace boson: to photon, or “the particle of light”, which is “the messenger” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle, which has electric charge, is accelerated or changes direction, this " disrupts” electromagnetic field in this concrete place, approximately as the stone, been cast into the pond.
From this “disturbance” is born the electromagnetic wave (light, either infrared radiation or ultraviolet, and so forth), and this wave is not than other as photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons “of the carriers of force”.
The more stable field
The same occurs with the boson of Higgs, with the only difference, that, so that this boson would appear, must be “disrupted” another field, field of Higgs.
However, Higgs's field considerably, is considerably more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order it to excite, it is necessary to acquire very and very high energy, as if the discussion dealt with the frozen pond, whose surface it could oscillate only very large stone.
This is why is necessary enormous particle accelerator as that, which is exploited in CERN - large hadron collider, which is ring with a diameter of 27 km! - for achievement such enormous energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful also for explaining the relationship between the boson of Higgs and mass.
In reality, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, as, for instance, magnets, interact, others - no: the sheet of paper, for example, never itself will be held on the refrigerator.
In exactly the same manner, not all particles interact with Higgs's field: those, which interact, have a mass, whereas others (as photon, by the way) it they do not have.
So that however, “can bring” all these studies, does ask the Mrs. of Plamondon?
In the science they are used for testing the correctness of standard model (S), and this also makes possible for physicists to grope the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts SEE.
Some of them passionately thirst moreover so that this divergence would be revealed, t to least nonconformity can open door for “new physics” and plug some holes of model.
The latter, it is necessary to say, it still has essential deficiencies, proposing no explanation for gravity (oy!) or for the dark material, which forms approximately 80% of universe (oy-oy!).
But thus far in CERN such divergences they did not find.
Consequences
Benefit from these studies for the daily life of mean statistical person to predict more difficultly, but would be error assume that it does not exist.
You look: at the very beginning the 60's the pioneers of the studies of laser in Bell's laboratories could not even assume, what revolution their works will cause.
They foresaw their applications in the science, but not and what is more.
In fact, already deceased physicist Uillard Boyle, which worked in Bell's laboratories, where was in 1960 invented the laser, and which itself developed the first continuous-wave laser (previous they were pulse) in 1962; he indicated that initially the laser was considered faster as “laboratory gadget”.
Represent…
And furthermore, application can be located for the set of instruments, which accompanies a study.
For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during its optical studies in 1969 developed the small sensor of light.
This sensor, although this was not completely by its initial destination, now serves “as eye” for all digital cameras of peace and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics of 2009.
This, certainly, it does not mean that the work of large hadron collider will necessarily change our life, but this only shows, in reality that everything can be.
Palliative aid - best method to die… | “Debt”
In the commission for worthy death in Quebec the delicate ground of the end of the life recently was discussed.
Debates soon must be renewed, and bill at this time is prepared.
Nevertheless in this area of importance much still is to be done.
“Debt” attempted to look more closely.
A total of several weeks ago Mr. L. Eshche lived one in his apartment in Monterezhi.
Cancer of prostate, which destroyed it from within, gave to it postponement for two years.
“To me they gave five years, I lived seven”, he says, between life and death, lying at the bed in the shelter of palliative withdrawal Victor-Gadbua in become white, where it arrived the day before.
“But this always shock, for this it cannot be been prepared”, he, says.
Disease makes its work: the improbable weakness, which does not give independently to walk into the toilet and even independently to feed.
Sitting at the table, on which stands appetizing dinner, it is surrendered and agrees so that it they would help to assume the food.
It is stimulated, even it teaches to smile, to talk with the unknown people, which work around it, they bring to it medicines, Veduta of it into the bath.
Courage before usual death.
“My largest desire so that they would cure me from diarrhea, this is humiliating”, it acknowledges.
Several hours after the personnel found medicine for this ailment.
“In the course of the life us they teach that the man must be moistened costing”, says Pierre Broder, psychologist in the shelter of Victor-Gadbua.
To regress to the state of child - for some intolerable humiliation.
“Everything depends on the ability of man” to be subdued to the decline, it asserts.
Since, in the opinion of many people, which carry out palliative withdrawal, outstanding events sluchayayutsya also at the very height of this decline.
The patients, who enter palliative shelter Victor-Gadbua, everything are sick with cancer.
Forecasts remove to them maximum three months of life.
In this stage, the command of doctors and nurses does not allow more than the aid, called “therapeutic”.
Mrs. a., 89 years, most of all fears to die “in the consciousness of the suffocation”.
But disease allowed me to learn her children.
“I have good children”, it adds.
“I greater than nothing want in the life”, she says before permitting placing to it the mask, which facilitates respiration.
It as before waits within the next few days the last visit of its son, which arrived from Italy.
In the shelter Victor-Gadbua with the aid of the group of volunteers they allow maintenance of body and aid with the nourishment.
This is the palliative withdrawal, which remains, when more than anything it cannot be made.
In order to make death of more comfortable.
In Quebec for each of 11 700 inhabitants one place in the establishments of palliative aid is fallen.
This it is very small, taking into account that sooner or later we all will die.
Here life continues under the best conditions, such as are possible, explains doctor Christian Martel - one of the doctors of shelter.
Be it comfort is physical, is emotional or is sincere.
Dying we will agree to grant oral garglings from the brandy or Pepsi, looking that it will request.
Diabetics we no longer force to control the level of sugar.
And death is the part of the daily activity.
Last evening we brought beer to Mr. x., who died today at night.
In the morning its son finished drinking this beer in the feet in deceased.
“We help close ones, just as to patients”, tells Natalie Savart, director for the care of patients.
In the shelter Victor-Gadbua not one day is similar to previous.
Next to the 93--year old man, who delights in by his last encounter with the family in the court, after being arranged on his pillows during the toast in its honor, tragically dies the young person of 36 years, surrounded by parents, by wife even by two small children and pereprobovashiy all, in order to survive.
“Into the latter half a year from three to five cots, it is always occupied with cancerous patients at the age to 45 years”, ozabochenno speaks doctor Christian Martel.
53% of patients, taken into the shelter Victor-Gadbua, arrive from the house, and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to the palliative withdrawal
It is considered that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to the palliative withdrawal, i.e., to the withdrawal, which is allowed in order to relieve sufferings of patients, which entered the final stage of their life, be it at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some establishments, such as shelter Victor-Gadbua and society of the palliative withdrawal at home of large Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancerous patients.
Specifically, this large gap in the system of public health of Quebec forces many doctors - specialists for the palliative withdrawal to fear the adoption of law, which legalizes euthanasia and aid in the suicide.
Since October circulates the manifesto, signed by heavenly bodies in the region of palliative withdrawal, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and by doctor Bernard Lyapuantom and testifying about their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to doctor Christian Martel, the system of public health of Quebec is insufficiently effective in order to ensure right to the palliative withdrawal of high quality before passage to euthanasia will be permitted.
Recently, she says, I saw the patient, who conducted 14 days in the department of first aid, in the terrible pains, and no one took the necessary measures in order to facilitate them.
I fear, that the patients desire to die only because they do not obtain adequate withdrawal.
At the same time, many oncologists to the last day try to save patients, in spite of the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard were already minimum, when it ended the harassing chemotherapy.
When I reported to my oncologist that I cease treatment, it answered me, which will regret, that I cease fight, she says.
In this case she me itself told that my days were considered!
There is no omnipotent withdrawal
Doctor Martel considers that 90% of patients, who request about death, thank medical staff, for the fact that they did not carry out their request after command for the palliative withdrawal facilitates their pain.
However, it is necessary to note that the palliative withdrawal is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight with the pain.
According to Elsi of Monroe, director for the palliative withdrawal in the society of the palliative withdrawal at home of large Montreal, the patients are not receptive to the anesthetization in 8% of cases.
In the very end of the life the doctors frequently come running to palliative sedatsii, with which the patient will sleep to the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.
It cannot be more been shut that we do not know about these sufferings.
Increasingly are more frequent and more frequent patients, by which does not succeed in facilitating the pain, they can have a access to palliative sedatsii.
Patients, who suffer from the pain, always speak one and the same phrase: “I want to die”.
But this necessarily does not indicate “I I want, so that to me would be conducted euthanasia”, this indicates “I I want, so that i would become more easily”.
The creation of this reporting became possible because of journalistic Grant from the institute of studies of the health of Canada.
Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
Officials, responsible for the building of roads, construction contractors, collectors of the means of political parties and specialists in the Italian Mafia day after the day tell that the fact that they know about the colossal “system”, which enmeshes construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade-union workers and mafia.
“The industry”, which very dearly managed to the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
“It is interesting, as is scattered this system after all means were started to the matter, jokes Jacques Dyusheno, deputy and the former Police Chief of Montreal”.
Specifically, because of it in 2011 broke out scandal as the side-line result of the investigation of the criminal offenses, connected with the roadbuilding contracts in Quebec, on which the Prime Minister of that time from liberals, Jean Share, agreed very unwillingly.
“The report to the Duchesnes” established the direct connection between the industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, one ministry alone of transport would preserve billions of dollars on the contracts”, if some held in control its instincts to take portion.
Commission Sharbonno “already displaced two mayors”, it adds, hoping that it will succeed in “revealing the diagrams, which stand after the individual personalities”.
Constant subdivision on the struggle against corruption, created in 2011
To the matter was connected the created in 2011 constant subdivision on the struggle against corruption, into composition of which entered the extensive staff of government auditors, inspectors and analysts.
And, furthermore, the colleagues of the special subdivision “hammer”, which after 2009 forced “sewage cartel” of Montreal, to end overstating the cost of contracts.
For a period of recent weeks was produced a series of searches, and to some municipal officials, in particular to Frank Zampino and to Richard Markott - mayor of small town, charges in swindle and corruption were produced.
On the turn - Zhil Vayyankur, recently retired from mayor Laval's post, the third in the value of the city of province Quebec.
They suspect it of repeated obtaining of bribes during the arrangement of state orders.
Furthermore, official charge was produced for several engineers of the service of the communications of Montreal and for construction contractors of Italian origin, including by Tony Akkurso and Lina Zambito.
The latter exploded present bomb, after telling to consequence about “the system” of obtaining state contracts.
For several years Zambito returned 3% of the cost of the contracts, concluded in Montreal, to a certain mediator, connected with the Mafia, who, in turn, transferred the money of the party of mayor Zherald by Tremblay “united Montreal”.
In 2000-X years Zambito it littered by money right and left. It transferred more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 Euros) to different parties of province, in essence to liberals, who were being located then in authority.
Furthermore, it acknowledged that illegally were gathered the means for the former Deputy Prime-Minister from the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
The sewerage contracts, in which they overstated the cost
In Montreal “system” of corruption it worked smoothly.
Zhil Syurprenan, which was engineer on the civil building, in detail described it before the commission: in ten years he obtained from the construction firms of gifts, invitations into the trips, to the tournaments on the golf, into the restaurants, to the matches on the hockey also of bribes on the whole to 736 000 dollars in exchange for the sewerage contracts, whose cost he overstated.
Other officials, responsible for the building of roads, acknowledged that they obtained to the paw, overstating calculations to 30-40% with the aid of the false additions.
Then one organizer of the party of mayor, Martan Dyumon, accused Mr. Tremblay of the fact that he intentionally shut eyes to existence of the parallel budget, which filled party cashboxes by dirty money.
After these revelations Mr. Tremblay retired at the beginning of November, after immersing Montreal into the deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, who sounded alarm.
The mayor of region River-de-Preri to the east of island, it resists since 2010 sale of the municipal section, purchased for 5 million dollars and resold after… 1.6 million housebuilders at the height of construction boom.
70% of dirty money in the pre-election campaigns
She indicates that in the investigation, which will be in the final analysis begun, it “will stretch for the small filament, which makes it possible to understand the functioning of system, kishashchuyu by ants in order to stop gangrene and to determine the guilty”.
This process it kharakterezuet as “painful, but positive”.
We are situated in the process of cleaning wound, but its own investigation group and observer will be necessary for Montreal, in order to avoid the return of doubtful practitioner.
As we are removed house.
It is regular.
Jacques Dyusheno notes from his side that “the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but especially it disturbs the role “elective officials, who knew about this diagram”, but not participated in the machinations.
Taking into account that the share of dirty money in financing of election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, it jokes: “To me they said that this was altogetherthe only pale reflection of reality”.
The government of Quebec proposes to limit to 100 dollars of donation to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: “Thus far we will not strictly limit elective expenditures, in the policy there be dirty money”.
It requires the complete readjustment of assignment system of state contracts and of financing of the parties: “We cannot descend below; boldly vniknuv in are things, we will be able to construct house on the more stable foundation, with the best control and legality”.
If this history throws shadow to the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno calls those, who laugh, to glance into his own court…
“PSZH - not FC [Financial Corporation] Barcelona!”
In this season you in PSZH attained unusual spread.
How you will explain this increase?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but can - and by new measurement PSZH.
Profits are great players.
Next to them I to time of ripening each day.
Operating personnel much also introduced.
These factors force me to daily raise the level of my game.
And during the match, this is simpler.
In the football everything occurs very rapidly.
But I am not made burning hot.
From the very beginning in the center of preliminary preparation in NIF in Klerfontene and to my arrival in Saint-Steven I always stepped forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition, established by Porta Anchelotti…
To completion of this summer not into the novelty to play the matches of very high level.
They know also that each training is very important.
This leads to the fact that this player as I, thirsts to be at the level and to be laid out on the maximum.
Furthermore, Porta Anchelotti lends support in my positioning.
It help such deputies, as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position, as i.
To anchelotti - master of the situation?
Certainly.
To anchelotti suggests respect to entire operating personnel.
Today in the first league to it there are no equal and it enters into the number of best trainers of Europe.
In it extensive experience, and it won numerous titles with the high-end clubs.
It worked with the great players.
I think, he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January in me with it was the encouraging conversation.
Then I moved away from an entire series of injuries.
The confidence, which it me renders; are also explained my achievements.
What you do think about the first part of the season PSZH?
In the first league Lyon took away the place of leader.
But we as before at call.
The League of Champions is one of our basic purposes: we effectively were qualified into one eighth of finale.
Which the purpose of club in this tournament?
We will try to pass how further as possible.
From now on everything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with the very good European commands.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto in order to have the capability to accept reciprocal match in one eighth of finale.
Will be able PSZH to become first-class European club in the short term future?
It for this already has a budget…
In order to become large European club, to Paris it is necessary to win titles and to fasten positions to the long-term outlook.
Today this is not so.
Financial in PSZH is means in order to make this project real.
Not to take title in the first league as in the past season, it will be large failure?
Certainly, this would be large disappointment.
In this year we real hotly desire to obtain this champion title.
In the past season we were to this close.
In May, there was disappointment, because we have everything in order to arrive at the finish first.
This was very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assume series title.
But another command, Monpele, played an even more fantastic season.
In this year, I think, everything will be in the order.
In spite of the fact that such strong commands, as Marseille, Lyon entered into the fight for the title and Bordo, I think that we have forces in order to defeat.
Do not think you that the media outlets do wait too much from PSZH?
This is normal, that from us they expect much, taking into account, was how much inserted and what we have players.
We completely for this are ready.
From the other side, when we house win 4-0 against Trua and us nevertheless find for which to criticize severely, certainly, this a little disturbs.
We ask the question, what people first of all wait from us.
We never will be able to win each output with the score 4-0.
We not FC [Financial Corporation] Barcelona!
We attempt to introduce the project of game.
Command is formed in the course of time.
We proved in the League of Champions that we can answer the contemporary calls.
You will look on Manchester United, for whom already two seasons do not succeed in passing into one eighth of finale, although they also spent enormous money!
Taking into account the inserted sums, we introduced you in 15 points in front already to the winter interruption.
This would be neglect to our opponents and to the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not at a height of the past season, were “waked” by this new PSZH.
This shows, to what extent the first league is captivating.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and to say to ourselves that, in spite of all difficulties, as a result we defeated.
PSZH, seems, completely depends on the exploits of Zlatana Ibragimovicha.
Well and that, if they indicate that there is certain “Zlatanozavisimost”.
This only means that Ibragimovich is very successful and that it drives in many heads.
It arrived for this and it proves, that it is the star of the first league.
Everywhere, where it played, it showed that he is great player and the star of world scale.
In the group we of it respect as man and as player.
It also respects people, which surround it.
That that it made, this is actually exclusive.
This it stimulates and others to improve its game.
Tyago Silva, which is one of the best defenders in the world, it also justifies all to advance.
How you did survive Euro-2012 from team France?
As disappointment.
I hotly desired to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching a little play time.
I saw there many things, and I left from there more strongly.
Today me succeeds in playing good elimination matches.
This that, on what I hoped from the moment of my baptism in dark-blue.
We extracted lessons from the fact that happened in the Ukraine, and now they must behave exemplarily.
What you do think about the first months of Didier Deshama in the chapter of dark-blue?
They for it are successful.
It has good positions in the elimination group to the world championship.
It a strict trainer, it is close with the players and inspires to the victory.
What was Loran Blanc.
But I did not want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euros.
I hope that Didier to Desham will bring dark-blue into Brazil.
Good deserved no one's (1-1), pulled out on October 16 in Spain - this is the basic match?
This match gave to us the faith in itself.
Each battled for all.
To this shock in Spain, in my career there were no similar matches.
To pay and to sell without the aid of banks - from Bitcoin
Complete opposition to the current money exchange, based on the central banks, numbered transactions between the obtaining sides c with the commissions for their working.
Furthermore, as frequently it occurs with these technologies, the obviously political vision: persuasion, that the current currency system, which consists of the bank monopolies, leads to the financial crises.
In reality, Bitcoin, invented Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is simultaneously the virtual currency (but converted into the dollars, Euro…) and by the protected protocol of exchange according to the type of BitTorrent, which permits implementation of the exchange of the files between participants in one level.
About 200 000 operations were already registered from 15 000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites assume bitkoyny for the realization of donations or as the pay means.
The course of bitkoyna, dostignuv of maximum into 30 dollars (23 Euros) in June 2011; five months later fell to 2 dollars before return today approximately to ten dollars (courses they were indicated on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in the comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB (European Central Bank)) in its report about the virtual currency, published in October, interested itself in this system.
It describes bitkoyn as “most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or Euro” and “similar to the usual currencies”.
Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as “credits” utilized for the advance in the video game, which are earned in the process of game or which it is possible to purchase (but sometimes and to exchange).
The social network of Facebook also developed a similar system.
But the operations of exchange are always controlled and is processed any central organ.
In Bitkoyn all nodes of network are simultaneously the holders of the accounting book, auditors, issuers of currency, pokupatelymi and by salesmen.
How does function this network?
Each transaction between two users in reality occurs between two electronic addresses, similar to electronic mail.
Only for each new payment user can select another address, ensuring thus anonymity.
The collection of the information, which relates to this transaction, signs electronically, with the use of a system of coding with the dual key.
Network can also verify the authenticity of transaction.
Because of the contents of file, possible to verify that bitkoyny, used in the transaction, actually there exist in the public calculating book, sent out throughout entire network.
The registration of new transaction in this book is key stage.
It penetrates the solution of the mathematical problem, sent out to computers, that solved which, as if the temporary Central Bank, obtains privilege to add this new line.
The discussion deals with the phase of hashing file, i.e., the conversion of large file into the digital signature, short and unique.
Computers " take” new transaction and add by it number before “to hash” everything together.
Purpose lies in the fact that to find the number, which will give the unique digital signature (many zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number it is found, they easily check other units, that it is correct.
Transaction thus occurs nerarzryvno of that connected with the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If user it is very rapid for the purpose of fraud (less than in ten minutes) it would wish to pay two times some and theme whereas by money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by network - and another would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, which solved task, obtains 50 bitkoynov.
In order to avoid inflation, reward is regularly divided in half, probably, prior to the end of 2012.
The number of bitkoynov in the rotation therefore is limited by 21 millions, but they are divided to one hundred-million, which leaves another reserve…
The complexity of task also grows with an increase in the computational power.
The life of network already survived ups and downs.
The sites, which render the services of Bitcoin, were subjected attack, and bitkoyny were stolen from the reserves.
“The used defect does not concern protocol itself”, it certifies Pierre Nuaza, who recently neglected Paymium - company achieving payments by real money with the use of a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB (European Central Bank) reported also about the opportunity of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But available money also possess this deficiency.
Important players, such as Wikipedia, reject to assume the donations of this type.
Others, such as the blog-platform of WordPress, them solve.
Recently Ady Shamir Dorit Ron from the institute of Veytsmana to Israel, they analyzed the calculating book and revealed that almost 80% of bitkoynov are not in the revolution.
“Gigantic sales” were declared in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged”, is glad ion It kholmkvist, that works in Coinabul, which is occupied by the conversion of bitkoynov into gold.
Pierre Nuaz, another author of benefit on this currency, solidly believes in the potential of this technology as the operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, are the equivalent of credit card (in the present money) or noncontact payment through the cell phone, but she uses Bitcoin for checking the transactions, which thus leaves more cheaply.
Possessor better controls his personal data and it can thus be anonymous.
System is simple in the realization for the owners, for which it is not necessary to establish new devices or software.
It suffices to only report the address, which can be “photographed and recognized” by telephone, refines Pierre Nuaza, certifying, that it has already thousand users.
There is a general tendency of the revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal.
“Before Bitcoin it will be affirmed, will pass a certain time, but 2013 can become turning point”, it predicts.
The ECB (European Central Bank) in its report intends, by the way, to reexamine the diverse risks, which are considered as the today increased, in the case of the success of this system.
We left from Afghanistan.
What is further?
The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
By NATO and Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army came the time to return to itself control over its territory, while for the Afghans to select its future, without hoping only on us.
From us the Afghan peasants, whom we considered as terrorists, suffered in essence.
And we themselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and by injured and crippled.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, the former commanders, who are hidden in Pakistan, but also frequently from the peasants, who reject the presence of foreign army as this was in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even to them are joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They suffer them, local rebels sometimes help them, but them more it will not be, as soon as West it will begin to behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base of Nidzhrab, which I observed from the height of the hills of those planted by almond trees because of the French credits, he passed to order.
The escorts of the trucks and armament in tracking of helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.
Will not be from the end of 2014 of the invasion of the Taliban in Kabul.
Circumstances varied with times of their insurmountable advance from 1994 until 1996.
Kabul was empty at that time, the country was in the fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
Taking by them under the control of the country then was received as its kind release, return to the safety.
Afghan women paid for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which them Al-Qaeda exceeded, but their position was not improved also during our days.
The former Mujahadeen, Afghan government and current Taliban are united in their desire to retain women in the subordinate position.
The basic characters of anti-Soviet war returned to the authority in 2001.
They became deltsov, which grip the state earth in order to resell them under the building to repatriates, who returned themselves from Iran and Pakistan, using the enormous American contracts of sub-contract.
They are discredited; majority of them, by the way, even themselves did not war.
People, as I heard in the rural locality, want the government, which would consist not of the thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those will leave, who knew how by the American generosity: the draining of capital is significant.
The young people of tiredness from the war and its ideology.
They lived in modern world during the expulsion in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its advantages.
About 65% of population are found in the age of up to 25 years; in Kabul now is counted 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of general population.
Public schools in the cities are filled both by the boys and by girls.
It is necessary to ensure with the jobs of these young people, which will want to return neither to the obscurantism of old parties nor to corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed militants, love cell phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which present modern world, and which look everywhere.
The army exists at the present moment.
The authorities, which will it command, they will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, a anti-Soviet struggle, already take measures for the restoration of the provincial guards, which were not subordinated to central authority.
Afghanistan, mountain country, with the strong local differences, must be to the certain degree decentralized, on the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it into the centralized state with the strong presidential authority, removing the post of the Prime Minister, who existed from the times of the constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular before the selections, outlined in April 2014.
But his country, beginning from the 50th years, and even is earlier, it depends on foreign aid.
Industry was not set to the feet, not one weir functions, not one irrigational system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing it is produced, except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is returned to particular initiative.
In the country, destroyed thirty times for years of war, the government control over the infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors walked, that Afghanistan possesses enormous mineral riches.
This only strengthened sensation, that the Western countries were present there, only in order them to take possession of.
Without energy for processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, without the means of transport in order to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of minerals.
Chinese already almost left the layer of copper mo. of Aynak, after leaving to international archaeologists (by financed World Bank) to dig out enormous buddistskiy complex and to remain the quite important employers of province.
It is necessary also that during one excellent day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to the high degree depend the import and export, would restore normal relations.
The conclusion of French combat subdivisions was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation deal provides for the retention of the traditional aid: face for the girls, for the boys, the department of French at the university, French institute, collaboration in the military, juridical, medical and agricultural spheres, support to archaelogical delegation.
Since 2009 in the tendency “to conquer hearts and minds” and to accomplish the impossible task of the combination of aid with the offensive operations, the service “military--civil activity” with the Defense Ministry (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with the small French public organization, contributed to numerous social activities and activity, directed on the restoration of agriculture in tens of mountain settlements.
These works, with the intensive attraction of local labor force, could help to hold in control the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, the restoration of scaffolding, fruit trees, the protection of soils and an increase in the area of the arable earth.
What we will leave to the memory about ourselves, after spending two billion Euro on defense expenditure?
Much modest budget would assist to an improvement in the conditions of life of the local population, very severe in these valleys, situated often on the height more than 2 000 meters above sea level.
Embassy obtained tens of written requests about the realization of the small agricultural works, which emanate from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the uprisings, directed by foreign groups, what desire farmers, as they told me, it is necessary to lend them small nonmilitary support, which was controlled well and would enter to them directly.
Heavy kinds of the constitution of Egypt
This is the new risky step of the President of Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than sometimes, regarding the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives to it extraordinary authorities, it decided to play stake everything.
The gates of all unaware, it declared on Wednesday, that the constitutive meeting will vote on the final text next day.
Rovno week ago the Head of State granted to meeting two additional months in order to finish work.
Soon already two years, as Egypt it rests on the preliminary text, in which several times were introduced correction, which weakens institutional stability and leads to the juridical contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the separation of the country.
In the opinion of its opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic to delirium”, continuing “to disrupt this word” and “to trample right”.
In the camp of its followers they are assured that this is the method to put an end to institutional and political crisis, after accelerating transient process.
Referendum must be carried out during fifteen days.
The very short time, which forces brothers to forego the intention to explain to Egyptians text, article after the article.
For the President this also the method to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction rages in the entire country.
Mohammed Morsi, seems, it is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in one interview for American weekly time.
Fact more that call to the accelerated voting resembles the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I leave to itself the extraordinary authorities”, which, as it is assumed, must be completed after the adoption of constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of constitutive meeting, for the most part the Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
The majority of liberals did not respond to the call.
In the middle of November, not long before the constitutional declaration, they flapped by door, feeling themselves unable to report its opinion.
The representatives of the human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society made the same.
So that the necessary quorum would be achieved, 11 people, spare participants, they were in a hurry added yesterday in the morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in the majority of the cases of article they were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused the fact that one of a few differences of day arose all around… time for the prayer, since some committee members calculated, that the hours of constitutive meeting were incorrectly disposed.
The text, on which yesterday still occurred the voting, consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 in the final analysis remained identical to article from constitution of 1971, which says, that “the principles of Sharia are basic source of law”.
Salafistskie parties, for which the introduction of Islamic right is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace “principles” by “the rules”, which would afford the opportunity of their stricter application.
For the Islamists the fact that this article was not changed, is evidence of their good will and respect for other participants in the Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy”, answer the liberals, who see in this only PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of constitution occurs through other articles.
They indicate in particular article 220, which grants to university al-Azkhar consultative role, in particular, in the fact that checking the correspondence of Shariat Law.
According to the specialist through Egypt of Sophie Pome, this causes anxiety, t k “people, called to make decisions, are not selected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the origin of theocracy”.
Many liberals, furthermore, they are disturbed by the fact that the following rector of this university is, it seems, will be far less moderated than current.
“At the present moment there is no concrete religious interference.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the civil right.
The majorities of the lawyers, who worked at this text, this not Ulama, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system” - calms Alexis Bloe, who prepares thesis on the Egyptian constitutional passage.
But it recognizes that “around article 220 can arise the ambiguity, since terms the used in it are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This relates in particular k “Fiqh” [Islamic jurisprudence, editor's notes].
And in the future a question can arise, how civil a judges are competent in order to decide on this”.
Besides its religious aspect, the text, accepted yesterday, undergoes criticism, since it gives wide authorities to the President of republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood assert that they considerably were reduced in comparison with the fact, what were with the old regime.
Another questionable moment: the authority of army.
In accordance with the wishes of servicemen, the examination of defense budget will pass not to parliament, but in the National Council of defense.
Also will not be forbidden the court above the citizens in the military courts, in spite of the requests of associations on the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed the apprehension apropos of the text, which they consider disastrous for the freedom.
Is preserved responsibility for blasphemy, and is from now on forbidden insult, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles no longer speaks about the protection of woman, emphasizes Kheba Moraef, from Khyuman Rayts Votch.
According to her, the prohibition of tortures in article 36 appears only positive moment.
The word, which did not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to appear last evening on the television, demonstrations were planned today in the second-half of day.
The supporters of the Head of State will, in turn, leave to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists wait holy places, navel of the Earth and sea from the brine
The Earth promised combines the greatness of Biblical truths, contemporary comfort and protogennic state of nature.
“Argumenty i Fakty Magazine” isolated five most important reasons, on which it is necessary to visit Israel.
Let us bow to the holy places
Is worth being in the river Jordan, in which was christened Jesus.
It is considered that on all, who go in this “of purchases”, God paradise condescends.
But Galileo - place of the miracles of Jesus: transformation on the wedding of water into the wine, walkings on the water, damping of storm and filling of networks.
Here Jesus appeared before the students and after revival.
But most of all sacred things in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the way of grief or cross way of Jesus (on the Latin - Via Doloroza).
It begins in the fortress of Antonius - to Pretoriume, where there was court, and along the streets of old city it leads into the temple of the coffin of Gospodnya on Golgotha - to mountain the place of crucifix, stone of anointment and place of the burial of Jesus.
Here is located the symbolic Christian navel of the Earth, which symbolizes rescuing humanity.
But they will erect the monastery of holy cross in Jerusalem on the spot, where, on the Christian legend, grew the tree, from which they made a cross for the crucifix of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is located the holiest place for the Israelites - wall of weeping, which was remained from the temple, destroyed by Romans in 70. A.D.
According to tradition people of different confessions leave here notes with the desires, which then are fulfilled.
To complete journey on the vertical line
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from the secret refuge from the enemies, which the tyrant great constructed in 25 g. B.C. for his family.
They are located on the perpendicular cliffs in the mountains at the height of 450 m above the level of ocean.
And only those under its own power can to reach to them, who are fascinated by mountain climbing.
Hoist along the cableway reaches rest to this historical top.
But on the north of the country at the height of 1600-2040 m is located the famous mountain-skiing health resort of Khermon, at which in the winter months - enormous influx of tourists.
The bus-shuttle reaches to it from the foot of mountain.
The total length of mountain-skiing routes is 45 km.
On the ancient legend, at the mountain peak allegedly lived heathen gods.
To visit the unique museums
In this country of approximately 300 museums.
You will not be for one trip in all.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, to visit stand.
Among them - the museum of Israel, located not far from the Knesset (parliament).
In it are stored the earliest Kumranskie manuscripts, or rolls of the dead sea, found in the caves of Judaic desert, and about 500,000 archaelogical and anthropological exhibits.
It is worthwhile to visit also museum of art in Tel Aviv.
In its exposure are widely presented the fabrics of impressionists and expressionists Mohn, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisleya, Matissa, to Modilyani, it stepped, Picasso.
In Akko it is possible to visit the museum-ban al of Basha, which is by itself halls of ancient Turkish baths with the models of visitors and bath house attendants of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting into the unique particular museum of rally, where it is possible to admire by sculptures they gave and Rodena.
There there are no guides and souvenir benches.
Entrance free, but donations categorically do not start.
The fifth - the museum of the Holocaust or Poison-your in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic division (children's memorial )is built into the memory about 1.5 million destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers of children.
You go in it - and you occur in the absolute darkness.
Stars twinkle.
And sound the names of child-Jews and name countries, in which they died.
Ukraine there also is mentioned.
To sanitate
Three basic health resort zones of Israel are located on the coasts of inland, red and dead of seas.
For each of them are ponds, akvaparki, delfinarii and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the temperature of water there does not descend below 21 degrees of heat, but air is warmed thoroughly to 23 degrees.
Dead sea is still warmer, and they there bathe the year round.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is located on lowest point of planet - on 417 m it is lower than the level of ocean.
Azure water in it - the brine, it is easy which retains on to the float even generally of those not knowing how to float.
Views are all around unreally beautiful.
They will go here in order to pass the course of treatment with the application of salt water - salt water, and medicinal mud, and to cure health with dermatitis, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus in order to bring the shaken nerves into order.
To be touched the secrets of the antiquity
The ancient part of Tel Aviv stores them - town it is jaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean.
Through it was passed the famous seaway, which connects Egypt, Syria, to Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
City is mentioned in the Ancient Greek and ancient-Egyptian legends.
On the legends, precisely, here Noah constructed its ark, and Persey it saved beauty Andromeda, with which here they lived long and happy life.
Tourists greatly love to wander on the uzenkim to the by-streets, named in the honor of zodiacal signs.
They speak, if you touch to the walls on the street “your” sign, fortune will become favorable.
In jaffa it is possible to meet newly-weds, who arrive from entire of Israel and even other countries to the photo-session.
But in Caesarea - Tsar Irod's city - it is possible to wander on the Roman theater, “to take” the fortress of crusaders.
In the Roman period Caesarea was main city Israelites and residence of Roman procurators, including the punty of Pilata.
The with great care restoreed theater now is used for the evening concerts and operatic plays.
To tourist to the note
Leaving into Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of population know Russian.
Money into the trip better to take not in the Euro, but in the dollars, which it is easy to exchange for the shekels (now 1 dollars. - 3.8 shekels).
Municipal transport - in essence buses, but in Jerusalem is a high-speed streetcar, and in Haifa - unique in the country subway line, which consists of six stations and which connects lower city with the upper.
In the essence, this is underground funicular.
Passage in all forms of municipal transport costs 6 shekels, for which it is possible to drive with the transplantations for 1.5 hours.
In Israel on the Judaic tradition they on Saturday note anvil block.
From the evening of Friday to the sunset on Saturday cease work the markets, stores, public transport.
But work week on Sunday begins from the morning.
In many cafe, restaurants and hotels - only Kosher food, which prevents pork, sea products, fish without the scale and dish, in which they are combined milk with the meat.
There propose large selection of dishes from the mutton and beef, the soups and desserts, prepared on the coco milk, the traditional Jewish paste of khumus, diverse sauces, balls from ground nuta - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
On the streets of Israeli cities there are no vagrant dogs.
Then there are very many fattened cats, that important-looking “go for a walk by themselves”.
In the evening them it is possible to see with those sleeping even on the roofs of parked automobiles.
Murlyki love populous places and do not reject the entertainments.
The lease of automobile, depending on stamp, will manage from 37 dollars. in a 24 hour period (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus is insurance - 15 dollars. during the day.
But the rental of bicycle will manage into 15 shek. during the day.
Tickets into the museums cost on the average on 30 shekels.
By language of the numbers
In 2012 Israel visited more than three million tourists from the entire world.
Most of all to travel and to rest arrived the citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The Earth promised from January to October 2012 visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which to 51% is more than similar index of 2010, to the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
“Great and powerful” to Moscow will bring: migrants will accumulate money into the language
Thus far deputies and human rights activists argue, which will give law about the required lingual testing, in the country already appeared the swindlers, who trade “fake” certificates
Yearly 13 million guest workers arrive into Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Larger partly these are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their sole purpose - to earn money for maintaining the families, which remained themselves on the native land.
Since December 1 came into force the law, according to which each working migrant obligated will be pass examination to the knowledge of Russian.
Thus far this rule acts only for those, who are intended to work in the sphere of maintenance, housing and utilities economy, way of life and retail trade.
However, in the course of time, they promise in FMS, tests will become required for all visitors.
Besides to pass it is necessary not only language, but also Russian history, and the basis of legislation.
Language proficiency it is necessary to confirm both for obtaining and for the prolongation of permission to the work.
Exception acts only for the citizens of those countries, where the Russian is official language.
Do not fall under for the action of law and people, which had time to obtain certificates and diplomas about the formation before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, predestination and the protection of the rights
The network of examination points will work under the aegis of the institute of Russian of the name of Pushkin, Universitet the friendship of peoples, MGU, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian VUZ (Institute of Higher Education).
Migrants can return tests in all cities; even now in Russia were opened more than 160 such centers.
Initiative about the introduction of testing supported Deputies of the Gosduma, and FMS.
But here are human rights activists before law it came into force, many times had time to pose the question in the press: and that this, strictly, it will give?
What will change the obligation of language proficiency both for the Russians and for visitors themselves?
First of all, - answer the representatives of migratory service, this will make it possible to reduce a quantity of people, which suffer from “working slavery”.
Very many speak now about the protection of the rights of working migrants, explains the leader of the representation FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only system of the organized collection will make it possible to 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems appear in migrants without the profession, formation, not knowing language, not having physical examination.
Without understanding of language, it is confident Sebelev, future migrant is doomed to encounter the unconscientious people, which under the guise aid will insert to it “pass” into the terrible close barracks, where it even tens to it of the similar will be by months wearied without the food and documents, poking on 12-14 hours in a 24 hour period.
We obtain many complaints from our migrants.
“On the native land to them they promise one, but on their arrival they deceive, select passports, do not pay out the promised wage”, confirms the chief for the main administration of the working migration ms of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Do not be scolded, nasyalnika!
Nevertheless, until many citizens of Central-Asian republics, who are gathered to the earnings into Russia, acknowledge that not only they do not know the language of the country, into which they strive, but also to own-that they write with difficulty.
Of course this not so much their wine, as the trouble: a few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to obtain even intelligent elementary education.
Indeed in their families with something even to feed children, without speaking already about properly dressing them, putting on shoes and equipping into the school.
Growing to the teenage period, whereas such children with the first opportunity leave for the earnings.
It is difficult, if it is bad with the language proficiency, they, acknowledge.
“You feel itself humbled and defective”.
True, with respect to law about the language the human rights activists note one crucial point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants, who have legal status.
But if there is no status - it will be neither examination nor the subsequent official work.
Meanwhile they as before live the large part of the guest workers in Russia illegally.
“Good to grant, or by strangers entrance is prohibited”
Many of the visitors assert that to obtain official status in our country not so is simple.
Reason - in the bureaucratic obstacles and all the same lingual difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization costs the money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But here false registration can be made rapidly and in all for one-and-a-half thousand.
The colleagues of the Russian police know that in essence false documents, there is no registration, hence and the cases of extortion.
“Request hundred, two to the cigarettes, tea”, shared with journalists the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov.
“Fly, not skupis, buy painting”
However, during the first day of the coming into force of law about the language it was explained that false are not only the migrantskie documents about the registration.
Several “fake” certificates about the passage of lingual tests are already withdrawn by the colleagues of FMS.
False paper are printed on the usual colored printer.
They of course were reached to new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, who were hoping themselves thus to facilitate to itself the task of the passage of tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This into two and the more of times is more expensive than the procedure of the official testing: it will manage to working migrant into three thousands.
In the fact that the primary task to the near period - of protecting system from corruption, so that “the crusts” would be simple to purchase, concur the representatives of authority, and human rights activists.
For the present authorities can promise to guest workers, who did not know how to successfully pass testing from the very first, time to the study of base lingual course.
Furthermore, by visitors, who do not know Russian, will be proposed work in the spheres, which do not assume active communication with the people.
By MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) does not take into the revolution the illegal market for the weapon
The portion of crimes with the application of a legal weapon is extremely small
MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) of Russia proposes to stiffen law in the attitude of the owners of civil weapon.
This is the reaction of authorities to the recent incidents: To harvest shots on the weddings, when it managed without the victims, and the slaughter, arranged by Moscow lawyer Dmitriy Vinogradov, as a result of which to harvest died seven people.
Policemen want to forbid the carrying of travmatiki in the public places and to increase the age, from which it is possible to obtain license for weapon - from 18 years up to 21 year.
Idea supported the head of Duma security committee and opposition to corruption Irina Yarovaya and it promised, that the corrections into the law about the weapon will introduce into the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are contented by the fact that the Russian authorities attempt to fight with the problem via “the twisting of nuts”.
In the network appeared the open letter, whose authors - the representatives of different public rifle organizations - require to forego “senseless stiffening”.
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapon is minimal, stated to the BBC Russian Service lawyer-criminalist Vasiliy Lesnikov.
According to the statistics MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs), in six months of 2012 are perfected 142 crimes with the application of a firearms, registered in the organs of internal affairs, whereas in all within the same period are fixed 1168,000 crimes.
The authors of the open letter are assured that the stiffening of the legislation in the sphere of civil weapon does not place to criminal to go in “black” market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow it is possible to find any weapon from the low price.
In MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) they meanwhile assert that the situation with the propagation of illegal weapon is controlled.
Suppliers: from the plants to the officers
“Black” market for weapon is supplemented along several channels.
Such basic channels five, tells Colonel retired Victor Baranets, ten years worked in the structure of the ministry of formation and general staff.
Screen shot of the site, which assumes orders for the weapon
The first - “army or military track”, i.e., the weapon, which was stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
“Weapon dragged Russian officers, and Caucasians themselves”, says Baranets.
Following type “black weapon” - stolen by criminals in the representatives of primary structures.
Baranets explains, that here enter those taken away from the police storages, and stolen in directly the colleagues of law-enforcement agencies.
Illegal “stems” depart to sale from the military storages.
The explosions frequently occurred on many military storages.
“There are the proved versions, that the part of the arson they were made specially - in order to cover lack”, says the former serviceman.
Their mite according to Barantsa, introduce the producers of weapon.
“Now propagate themselves the particular arms factories, which do not maintain competition on the International market and eject weapon from under the hem for the Black Market, including of Moscow”, says expert.
One additional source “black” market - smuggling.
Especially much acts pistols and automatic weapons from the poor countries, for example, of Kirghizia.
“There there is its production, sometimes primitive, and the Mafia, which organized flow”, was formed, explains the former serviceman.
From where weapon?
Experts calculated, which the approximate portion of each of the supply sources of illegal weapon for “black” market.
Report about this in 2011 prepared the center of problematic analysis and state-administrative design.
Specialists analyzed account MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) and Rosstata, kriminologicheskuyu literature and open data of portals on the weapons thematics.
The overwhelming majority of the illegal weapon, write researchers, enters from the army and power ministries.
Half of entire weapon on the Black Market proved to be there “through fault of officials, whose work was connected with the weapon”, it is spoken in the report.
According to the data of researchers, 17% of cases the weapon enters from the places of armed conflicts, the embezzlements in the stage of the production of weapon occur in 14% of cases, 5% are fallen to “black archaeology”.
Salesman-consultant of one of the weapons stores, that requested not to call his surname, it assures, what weapon, found by black diggers, already long ago no one buys - too old-.
Most frequently, as he speaks, after the new party the salesmen will go to the military storage.
Through the ensign the man buys one, for example pistol TT.
To it they extract it, transfer through zaborchik.
“It transports it into the city and here sells on 900 Euros for the piece with two stores”, he says
“Pravda, the police in the policy of all matters; therefore periodically when burns plan with respect to the discoverability of crimes, is conducted control purchase in the merchants of illegal weapon”, adds consultant.
“As in the luxurious store”
Salesman and buyer most frequently find each other through the acquaintances.
I glanced to the sites, into the blogs, until responds the comrade, who proposed to arrive to the platform “racing”, where there will be man, who will drive away me into “the corner”, where we will deal.
I learned the price of stem only there
military reviewer Victor Baranets
In order to reach stem to me it is necessary the acquaintance, xwho has output, says salesman-consultant. - In me this acquaintance exists, but I in it am not confident.
Salesmen on the markets exist, but it is there also necessary to arrive, conditionally, “from Ivan Ivanovich, who requested to transmit, that in daughter the tooth fell out”.
I the now even pair of brass knuckles obtain through the man, in whom it is confident.
It also them supplies only to me, because he knows that I will not return him.
Novices search for weapon by different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried himself in the role of the buyer of illegal weapon in the middle of the 1990's, when article about this was prepared for the publication.
Diagrams, according to him, did not change.
To it they gave album to the photographs, where there was “everything anything”.
“I felt itself as in the luxurious store”, recalls serviceman.
To the buyer according to Barantsa, they do not propose tomcat in the bag - everything can be tried.
I, potential client, simply do not buy - we will go with the salesman into the forest, we there target in.
“To me they give the opportunity to shoot, and when I I am convinced, which beats weapon well, we begin to deal”, describes procedure expert.
Store on the sofa
Prospectors in the Internet derive to the sites and groups in “Vkontakte”, where they propose to purchase weapon “for the different purposes”.
No documents and personal encounters are necessary for this.
“It suffices to have the specific amount of money”, they write in the advertising cap on the site “to purchase combat pistol or automatic weapon”.
On it the users leave their claims and pose questions.
But to minor they do sell?
“Without the license certainly”, asks user “Ivan” (orthography it is preserved).
“Purchase TT. Moscow” - laconically formulates the request “of Fedorenkov”.
The Federal Security Service now scattered the enormous network of false sites and those desiring to purchase combat weapon rows by shovel.
People go as hungry fish to prikormku, and they then obtain in Siberia coal
military reviewer and former military Victor Baranets
I heard about these diagrams: usually site is registered beyond the limits of the action of Russian laws.
People assume orders.
The buyer through the automatic teller machine produces payment.
“As the answer they send photograph and instruction, where is hidden weapon”, says the press-secretary of public organization “right to the weapon” Dmitriy Kislov.
Victor Baranets asserts that after leaving claim on the site, it is possible to remain without the weapon and to go behind bars.
The Federal Security Service now scattered the enormous network of false sites and those desiring to purchase combat weapon rows by shovel.
“People go as hungry fish to prikormku, and they then obtain in Siberia coal”, it asserts.
Makarov for 100 dollars
With the purchase of illegal small arms, according to the estimations of experts, it is possible to be packed in the sum from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitriy Kislova from the organization “right to the weapon”, pistol of Makarov it is possible to acquire for 100-300 dollars.
Month, it is necessary to wait.
It dispatches from the storages of prolonged storage by the management of these storages of middle link.
On official stastistike of department, on the comparison from January to October 2011 the number of such crimes as a whole on Russia was reduced by 7% and composed 22.9 thousands, and a quantity of revealed facts of embezzlement and extortion of weapon, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8%.
IN the USA strike the workers of fastfuda and supermarkets
Through the work on cashbox “Makdonalds” it passes to fourth of all American adolescents
In the recent days on America gave a ride the wave of protest actions against the low wages in the department stores of the corporation of Walmart and restaurants of the popular networks of the fast food, such as “Makdonalds”, “Burger King”, “Tako of Bella”, “Uendis” and “by Kentucky frayd chiken”.
Thus far no one undertakes to predict, will become this wave ninth wave or it is judged to be breathed out by it in the early stages.
Actions support trade unions and number of left public organizations.
Besides an increase in the modest wages, which obtain the series workers of Walmart and system of the fast food, by the purpose of the organizers of protests appears the creation in them of trade-union organizations.
Thus far this sector of economy barely is enveloped by trade-union motion.
46 cents per year?
Actions began last week, after the day of gratitude, on so-called “black Friday”, when the orgy of cheap sales, which took million average men and which was being sometimes accompanied by brawls, was brought down in America.
During this day some workers of the corporation of Walmart, in which around the world work 2.2 million people, left their jobs and picketed together with the trade unions and left activists the stores of corporation, whose goods was calculated for the people of modest and average abundance.
Walmart deals in all in the light, from the diapers, hunting guns and automobile batteries to the vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores on the average from 8% to 27% are cheaper than in the large supermarkets.
Therefore many low-paid workers of Walmart supply with goods themselves only in themselves on the work.
Accessibility and commodity bundle made Walmart of one of the largest corporations of America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods podeshevke it partly because little pays its workers.
The latter also complain about the heavy working conditions, for example, to the shortage of forklift trucks or manual scanners.
Participants in the actions on “black Friday” required increasing wage and lamented to the fact that the cost of the medical insurance, allowed by corporation, ran up from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
To the typical worker of Walmart, who obtains 9.5 dollars an hour, this expenditures not on the pocket, they spoke.
Scientists from the University of California to Berkeley prove, that if Walmart increases srednuyuyu wage to 12 dollars an hour, this will manage corporation in 3.2 billion dollars.
This is approximately to 1.1% more than it spends on the wage now.
If Walmart wholly shifts an increase in the wages in the arms of buyers, then each visit to store will bypass with them in all to 46 cents more expensive.
In the year they will spend on some 12.39 dollars more than now.
Supporters Walmart sufficiently note that the protest actions occurred in all in nine states and applied the corporation not of maleyshchego damage.
“Black Friday” continued in its stores from 8 hundred in the evening on Thursday to midnight of the following day, and sold about 5000 goods per second in this time of Walmart.
On the whole its cash registers produced on “black Friday” almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of corporation Dan Fogelman asserted in the interview for the left site of Huffington of Post, that the jobs left on the whole “less than five” the colleagues of Walmart, and that protest action was in all “current piarovskim trick” of its organized trade union.
“Free cashbox!”
Protests were continued on this week in New York, where their object were not the department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city they do not give, and therefore here thus far there are not them), but “Makdonaldsy” and other cheap restaurants.
Makdonalds indicates that it sells billions of portions, and after this it even does not give to you hospital and does not pay you for the honest work!
Dzhumeyn Williams, the member of the town soviet of New York
At the given moment the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation, is 7.25 dollars in hour.
The restaurants of the fast food with its time increase, but temporarily, and on the average their series workers obtain in New York 8.90 dollars in hour.
Less them in this expensive city earns no one.
As it is possible to exist in New York to such money, it is incomprehensible for me.
Once through “Makdonaldsy” passed almost fourth of American adolescents, who earned additionally after their counters after school, living in this case in parents.
Almost no one saw in this the basic source of subsistence or he planned to be detained there for a long time.
Now I constantly run at the interview with the workers “of Makdonaldsov”, which complain, that they must live to this wage and sometimes even feed to it children.
From the other side, on the forum of the newspaper of Wall Street Journal hangs the commentary, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to start children, if you do not know, on that you will feed them.
Participants in the protest actions, which began in 6.30 mornings on Thursday in “Makdonaldsa” on the 40th street and on the Madison-avenue, required that to the cashiers and the cooks of the system of the fast food they would begin to pay as the minimum 15 dollars an hour, i.e., more than they doubled their current minimum earnings.
They also required that in the sphere of the fast food trade-union organizations would be created.
American law forbids administration this to prevent and to punish the activists of trade-union motion by fault findings and by releases.
From the other side, the administration rarely facilitates them life.
But to envelop with trade union the fast food is complicated for the objective reasons.
One of the main things - unusual staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place during this day and in a number of other cheap restaurants of the Manhattan.
The culmination of action was in the middle of day meeting in “Makdonaldsa” next to the Times-square, on which came out several local politician-Democrats, in particular, the member of the town soviet of Dzhumeyn Williams, who stated: “Makdonalds” indicates that it sells billions of portions, and after this it even does not give to you hospital and does not pay you for the honest work!”.
Demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for the post of the mayor of city Bill de Blasio, who stated that “we must harmoniously enter the support of the workers of the fast food so that they would attain the valid payment and economic prosperity, which deserves each New Yorker!”.
As described occurred New York Times, this was the largest action of this type in the history of the American sphere of the fast food.
But in it participated only several hundred people, besides far from all of them were the workers of the rapid public catering, in which in New York were occupied tens of thousands of people.
It is thus far unclear, this spark will give birth to the flame of mass motion.
“Thus far to deceive the brain is average”
It is recently accepted to receive theme of the augmented reality the popular among the worshippers of contemporary technologies in essence through the prism of special glasses.
First in summer at its annual conference the working model showed Google, and then it became in November known that claim to the appropriate patent gave Microsoft.
However, from the conversation with the team leader of interactive 3d-technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharamom Izadi it follows that for the scientific this companies are glasses - passed stage.
Them beckons the prospect for manipulation by virtual objects in air by naked hands, the creation of the virtual free spaces.
- Describe, if you please, briefly how is occupied your research group?
- We deal with the cooperation of man with the machines, but in this case we attempt to move apart the boundaries of this interaction.
Thus far humanity in the mass got stuck in the stage of work with the pixels on flat screen, sometimes poking in them by finger.
We want to glance to 5-10 years to forward and foresee cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the prefix of Xbox and the sensors of Kinect - this is step forward, and almost not one Xbox without Kinect is today sold, indeed by all interestingly zhestovoe control.
- Which still us does wait in front?
- In spite of the fact that Kinect withstood interaction to the physical layer, much, until now, occurs on the flat screen, sometimes into 3d.
Information input was improved (system obtains more than data), but conclusion thus far not very.
We attempt this to change, work at the truly three-dimensional systems of mapping onto the base of different technologies, including of projective.
It is necessary to let out the computer world into our, physical, to make its more touched.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only user, but also space around it.
Then we are able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in much the more convenient form.
And first of all - to feature these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- That you do think about vocal control?
Popular piece, but they do not overestimate it?
- It definitely it is not possible to name panacea - arises a question of privacy, because it is not always desirable to notify those surrounding about its actions and intentions.
In reality all forms of interaction with the computers are good, but each in their niche.
For example, for control devices in the public places in us was the project, within the framework of which we thought above the gestures, but not above the sweeping, but above such meager, short.
In this case the gestures were removed not by the camera of device, but by the wrist bracelet, which fixed the motions of the bones and muscles.
Thus far it by large, but it is possible to theoretically decrease to the size of wrist watch.
But generally future after the mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- This as?
- For example, as you will request me to transmit to you this jar of aeration?
You will say and simultaneously will show.
- I usually simply speak.
- O, this will very complicatedly recognize.
- I.e., you do want to force users to be adapted under the fact that can or cannot at the given moment machine?
- Is entirely not necessary, but this mutual rapprochement.
I think, soon for us in essence it is necessary to work at the development of the new types of the sensors, which will make it possible to more precisely determine the reactions of man.
This there can be, for example, laser sensors, they not bad permission in the depth, this is very important.
- If we speak about your work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect, such as you have claims to the contemporary cameras?
Is not sufficient permission, depth or still something?
- In principle current generation - this that, from what it is possible to be repulsed in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Certainly, well to obtain megas-pixel 8 with a velocity of 1000 C/s.
But the matter not in megas-pixel themselves, but as the matrix and to depth.
All current technologies for us are insufficiently good from a last point of view - this adds works to the designers of algorithms.
I.e., it is necessary to remember not only about the permission in to x and y axes, but also Z.
Also are very important speed, quantity of personnel per second.
The motions of man are sufficiently dynamic, and current 30 C/s it is frankly not enough, especially for the gestures.
Steven Betishes from our Redmondskaya laboratory made a sensor of contact with the controlled delay of working - from 1 to 100 ms; moreover contemporary series sensors are nearer to the second (60-100) index.
Not all are understood, how this influences man-machine interface.
in my work the equivalent of this device, which does not only require contacts, greatly proved useful to me, so that the personnel it would be per second a little more.
- A a quantity of cameras increased must not be?
- Into Kinect now there are three “cameras”, one of which in reality - infrared emitter, and the second - receiver of reflected signal.
But here already the third camera - this, strictly, the usual sensor of the visible region.
It does not adapt for determining the depth of object.
A potentially larger quantity of cameras they could solve problem…
Or to aggravate it, after increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be create rather well the flexible analog of Kinect, be played a little with the curvature of the arrangement of cameras and look, as this will help in the three-dimensional determination of position.
- To what extent I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, did not present to the public its glasses.
You it does not seem that from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of the augmented reality glasses - this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Certainly, always to stroll, holding smartphone in the raised hands, is not very convenient, but this is what I think: the steepest version would be “transient” augmented reality, when on the basis of cloud platform you could be switched from the glasses to the smartphone, projection display and further everywhere.
Glasses - very personal device, in this their force (private things you see only you), and simultaneously weakness - augmented reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work at virtual objects together with other people.
- Let us represent in the minute that the manipulation with virtual holographic objects in air is accessible not only to Tony old vodka from “iron person”, but also to simple mortal.
There is one problem, which frequently indicate the criticisms of this idea: there is no such opinion!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers your group does prepare to this call?
- In my lectures I frequently say that the augmented reality - this of the seventh according to the calculation breakthrough in the man-machine interface.
I think, the additive of tactile sensations completely can become the eighth.
For the present one of the interesting is special effect - the use of the second hand as the unique base layer for the image.
It excellently records pressures!
But there are the technologies, which are actually directed toward the giving to here these “pictures in air” of tangibility - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at the fixed point, where is located finger, sensation gives, but thus far it very weak - as if to you blew to the cushions.
There are bracelets to the wrists, which influence nerve ends in the fingers - also promising trend.
- A you did attempt to deceive the brain?
To force it to think that he does feel that the fact that like it must feel at that moment, when it something does see?
- Here this is a good idea, we yet did not try so to make.
Here lies one additional task, above which one must be beaten still for long - as to force person, who is physically found in the very limited space, believe, what it goes along that opened, practically infinite - we work also at the concepts of the races (in no way such, as in the clubs), moving platforms, or enormous spheres.
To thus far deceive the brain is average, work still very for many years.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality of such attractive for the researcher - many things in absolutely infancy.
Vkusovshchina instead of the culture - Rosbalt. RU
“Rosbalt” continues the project “Petersburg advance guard”, dedicated to townspeople, which are located in front, in the advance guard of culture and art.
The bright workers of the art-scene of Petersburg already fell in this top-list, whose achievements exceed the scope of city, frequently finding acknowledgement in Europe, passing All-Russian reputation.
New hero “of Rosbalta” - epatazhnyy artist Cyril Miller.
Entire city knows Cyril Miller - the bearded person, dressed in the entire red, who is encountered first in Russian museum, first in summer garden, then on the fashionable get-togethers and varnishing days.
Cyril Miller's pictures always collect the crowds of the spectators, wherever they were not advanced.
Cyril Miller - one of especially Petersburg social-philosophical skazochnikov, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this the bright person of the Petersburg advance guard of the end of the 80th - the beginning of the 90th.
Furthermore, he is man of city, by his appearance on the streets causing smile in townspeople, that raises by all mood.
Recently it in the hands took street organ and became Petersburg organ grinder, since it matured for this complex role by entire its bogemnym existence, by philosophy and by image.
- Cyril, and why you nevertheless do walk around the city in the entire red, but not in the yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I selected red color as fashion designer, who carries out form and image.
In this peace red color - this is a compromise between the artist, imidzhmeykerom and society.
Although in the society everything which barely not gray, causes aggression and excitement of unkind property.
But my provocations are directed toward that so that the conversation would begin.
Entire history of my provocative actions - invitation to the discussion.
- A when you did understand that it must be artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevskiy, where my works were put out.
I understood that this is my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free of the type me were incomprehensible.
I began to be friends with the artists of new wave, with the postgazonevshchinoy, which led to “Pushkinskaya-10”, and more there was no wave.
It throws me into the theater, clothing, music, in all genres, except word.
- All this was combined in your Art-clinic… - To me it was important to appear in the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995 I engaged territory in Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was repair, there were a musical-artistic club, bogemnyy club, house of Petersburg Bohemia.
Many there were born: NOMy, Tekila-jazz, I remember, as cord they brought with the project “ear of van Gog”.
Cord and its friends of Paley under the plywood light songs, they were in the covering tricot, among them there was fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.
When group began to play alive, it became “Leningrad”.
Trachtenberg was leading of many programs until the khali-galivskikh times.
We gave Trachtenberg to them, and his great career went, and base formation and training it obtained.
Gallery “D 137”, club “Griboedov - these are echoes from the Art-clinic.
There our workers and habitues left.
I am the hero of the yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000 interrogation was in the press, reward was “people of our city”.
In the nomination “artist of year” was named I, my culmination ended.
In the new times according to the old rules uncomfortably to work, I am man of truth, honesty and culture of past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, it is possible to be popular, but by not very cultural.
- By your in works is inherent the learned manner.
- Many my pictures - this Heath, in them the clearly expressed urgency and sharpness.
In me there will be program exhibition, “Russian museum in the clowns”.
Clowns - timeless category.
I earlier social was, to now be similar - this is painful and it is terrible.
But in the clowns everything is spread, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, i have grotesque ideas.
For example, rescuing peace via totalitarian changing of clothes in the order order.
Now they meet on odezhke, being oriented toward the external mechanics, but not to the internal person.
But, it can, to it hand given it cannot be and into erysipelas spat necessary.
And fraud will be taken with the aid of the changing of clothes.
- A recently we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - Cultural city must have this hero.
To whom, as not to me, it to be.
- Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be accurate, tactful, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures occurs.
Earlier people were brought down into the flocks, Bohemia one loved, simpletons another.
Now all broke into the micro-associations, now with difficulty it will be pleased by all.
I am not stodollarovaya paper in order by all to please.
It is now necessary to think, you will please whom.
Now in each cult hero on 100 worshippers.
- A to Mikhaylov's Stasa it comes on several thousand!
- To it come broshenki, there sex-social sphere operates.
But 300 people will arrive on the cultural soil, but 10,000 will not arrive, and as a result of less than the management, money, everything withers.
I have worshippers, the main thing - not to deceive them, not to spoil nazhitoe.
I in the youth wrote such pictures that in one collector they on the wall next to Falk and Larionovym hung.
I began from the pictures, by which they usually conclude.
Concepts now frequently confuse.
They say: culture is spiritual, the culture of consumption.
Does not have culture whatever the consumption, this of another opera.
I man of the culture of yesterday, grew based on the examples of the artists, who lived in poverty and died in misery, they rejected the money for the drawing of pictures.
I for this here culture.
- Cyril, what it is not sufficient to Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: official from the culture.
But each of them can be occupied by culture.
With the correct Tsars everything not so was, Tsars, can, greatly they did not understand in the culture, but they were understood, that it is necessary to hold correct experts.
Good consultants are here in Moscow now.
In our Petersburg the people exist, which could be experts, but they were begun to move, since the higher experts, who will correctly estimate these experts and will give road to them were necessary.
Now flourishes vkusovshchinka.
The same Erarta, but them distinguishes that the fact that they honestly indicate that we assume not all modern art, there are such artists, as must search for to themselves other museums.
- That such for you - Petersburg?
- Petersburg - this is not cultural capital, in Moscow the cultures are much more, there soil exists.
But to art grow difficultly on our stones.
Cultural soil is necessary to us, and writers it is now more than the readers, this is incorrect.
There are here in Europe very many people of those being curious. which walk to the exhibitions, concerts.
This layer is fine.
We should make fashionable art as this was at the beginning of past century.
Project is realized to the means of Grant of St. Petersburg
To bear in space
Earth in the danger.
Global warming or collision with the asteroid-killer.
The caravans of spacecraft with the earthlings aboard leave for the searches for spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, does arise chief problem, as to continue its kind under weightlessness conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think that the selection is small.
Actually the present planets only two, which can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“This Venus and Mars”, counts the senior scientific worker of the state astronomical institute of name P. k. of Sternberg (GAISH (State Astronomical Institute im. P.K. Shternberg)) Vladimir Surdin.
But if on Mars condition are more suitable for the life, then on the surface of Venus - the temperature of 500 degrees.
To live is possible only at a high altitude or in orbit of Venus… in space.
They began to approach questions of reproduction in space from the flora.
Experiments on the plants still half a century ago were conducted.
Four generations grown pea of grown in orbit differed in no way from their terrestrial types.
Then - orbital injection of insects, tiny fruit fly-drosophila.
The eggs of quail in 1979 sent into space, in order to verify, as is developed embryo under weightlessness conditions.
We obtain at the output of absolutely normal fledgling.
But problem here further begins.
“The problem, connected with the fact that this fledgling must find support, it must arise to its of leg and begin to move”, explains manager of the laboratory of the institute of biomedical problems (IMBP) RAN [Russian Academy of Science] Vladimir Sychev.
Without having found support, fledglings disorderly somersaulted.
But the complete atrophy of instincts occurred after 10 hours in newborns.
Fledglings did not react to the light and sound.
And there trouble was in the fact that they simply died in four days.
“Even two times we peeled fledglings, they refused after this, because simply it cannot be there with them worked”, establishes failure of experiment with the fledglings in space Vladimir Sychev.
The last time biological “minikovcheg” flew in orbit of 16 years ago with animals.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, on the biological satellite “of Bion” there will be only unisexual individuals.
There was experiment with the rats, that were sent into space already with the fruit.
In principle, they there revealed nothing supernatural.
“This exactly was on the biological satellites, but furthermore - this is single experiment, and such research must be conducted”, notes Vladimir Sychev.
Posterity appeared after landing in space rats.
But to approach the problem of multiplication directly in space thus far is not obtained.
Complex task.
Animals, losing, customary living environment, simply cannot realize its sexual instinct.
But man, in contrast to zveryushek, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and in the state to create the becoming emotional background.
For ethical reasons similar experiments are not conducted.
But women into space fly narrower than 50 years.
The largest risk was in the Tereshkovoy.
But the most precious, that there is in humanity, this is female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on the Earth could say: it will be preserved after flight into space.
It will know how to bear child after this flight.
“Indeed this question no one answered”, tells the veteran of the rocket-space branch of Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, in all the year after flight into space, first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova bore daughter.
The father of the child of Andriyan Nikolayev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 in second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskoy, by that twice visited orbit and even worked in outer space, was born son.
However, risk remains.
It is small, one it is counted the cosmonauts, in whom after endurance flights everything managed, and grows healthy generation.
“A if is more, then this is dangerous even with the orbital flights”, sum up the sum airman-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia Valerie Polyakov.
And nevertheless, to humanity it is necessary to search for some new ways in the biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
Hydraulics laboratory TSPK - required preparation stage for the flight.
Here under the conditions of zero buoyancy cosmonauts perfect the habits of work of outer space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for the adult water, let and comfortable, but nevertheless alien medium, then for the breast children - native element.
Small ikhtiandry as if confirm - life to the land left the ocean.
Is a connection meanwhile that little-one it is located approximately 9 months in mom in the okoplodnoy liquid, to it to more easily become accustomed then to vodichke.
In principle this is logical, because from the moment of generation, from the moment of that first bathing, only of 2 weeks is passed.
“This is very small in order something to forget”, says the instructor of grudnichkovogo floating the sea-scape of Aksenova.
In a word, if weightlessness is more natural state for the born child, then for the woman - are necessary gravity, gravitational force.
The muscles of stomach, basin very rapidly in weightlessness weaken, capability for the ejection of fruit falls.
Well it is agreeable, let us lower even this, relying on the stimulators of labor.
It is possible, of course, in the special camera to go to the kinds, it will eject it.
“A is further that?” - poses nontrivial questions Valerie Polyakov.
From the other side, to child is also necessary artificial gravity.
Without perceiving the earth's gravity, organism will not form skeleton and muscular system.
Newly born in orbit it cannot be as adult, dressed into the special load suit for the trainings.
It simply will be deprived which to it will be vital necessarily.
“This experiment, to which we with you will go, after allowing the generation of child in the foreign medium, will lead to the fact that we will bring to the Earth invalid, completely dezadaptirovannogo person”, will foresee the leader of committee on bioethics IMBP RAN [Russian Academy of Science] Igor Pestov.
Thus far the generation of children in space - question of theory.
However, after this time it will be reality, when earthlings aboard their ships leave for the distant planet, which will become house for their descendants, originated in space.
Chief for the main control and auditing administration: Checking Schwarz-system fell through through fault of politicians.
In the branch of public procurement the Czech Republic has available good organs of control and, in spite of the presence of qualitative legislation, it lags in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kal, the Vice President for supreme control and auditing administration, from the interview for the site of Aktuálně.cz.
“Law never will be ideal, but to adapt it must correctly, what, in my opinion, is not sufficient”, it commented on the current situation of feces.
The joint inspection of the Czech and German organs of control allows similar conclusions.
_as example incorrect practice give Peter Nechas approach to so so-called Schwarz-system.
Recently Prime Minister did state that GDP (civil Democratic Party) will not disturb owners by checkings - does leave this forbidden or permitted?
“To law it follows to be any means those established, and, if it forbids something, then Prime Minister cannot resist the work of establishments, by which he is required to check and to seek fulfillment of commitments”, it establishes feces.
At the session of revisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German sides, within the framework of which was compared the legislation about public procurement of both countries.
With which specifically did deal the discussion?
The parallel checking, which we began, probably two years ago, has.
Simply stated, speech about that which asserts European legislation, how they must pass public procurement, further follows national legislation and then also application in practice.
_all information be assembled and, even with still unfinished checking, reveal interesting difference - simply stated, legislation in us can be “precise and error-free”, however, in practice application we on some parameter be inferior Germany.
Hence it follows that it is not enough to create ever more and the more precise rules, it is necessary to be concentrated during the application of a law itself.
But strictly as this project it can help you, that it for you does mean?
Specifically, this joint control can make a contribution to the efforts on the cessation of the refinement of laws, reduction and improvement of limitations, because this does not lead to the positive result.
The economy indicates obtaining the corresponding thing for the reasonable (but not always low) price in order to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we this will reach, after lowering the limitation of orders.
Possibly, this system will overfill “by paper” so that those, who will wish to find holes in this system, will them find much easier than if limitation was not reduced.
You speak about the internal problems of the practical application of legislation about the public procurement.
But as does function control system in Germany?
Is there there this organization as our KRU (control and auditing control) or this does work otherwise?
As far as establishments are concerned, there as our KRU comes out Bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle; also there is a board, which works a little differently, but in essence of both establishments they function analogously.
Furthermore, authorities to the certain degree are similar, but since Germany has federal structure, there is subdivisions of Audit, also, at the level of the federal earth - in this their system differs somewhat from our.
BRH can govern only federal money, we have available federal dollar.
The public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal State Auditing Chamber.
What local legislation, it is there simpler than?
Generally, I did not want to compare without concrete data, but in a certain sense Germany can be taken as the model, but it cannot be definitely said that it is better in everything.
This so, because they better do manage the control?
Definitely no, but I will be repeated, to me similar comparisons do not please.
But it is necessary to say that even the model countries encounter many problems.
Otherwise, they did obtain no advantage from the collaboration with our office, it is correct?
If we speak about the domestic legislation, then as they were reflected in your establishment of correction to the law about the public procurement, by some means are manifested consequences?
Taking into account that the juridical force of these corrections is sufficiently short, it still in no way appeared in our works on the control.
Since we carry out control through the fact, it is necessary to consider a certain delay.
We take this into consideration only in the process of the preparation for future checkings - we began to use our new tool “the detection of the risk of neekonomnosti”, through which we drove away almost 14000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be manifested, because limitations change, the conditions of some types of tenders change and so on.
What do you think, the assertion of this law will bring benefit or increment load on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law undoubtedly step in right direction, and, I hope, this will be confirmed.
The problem, which can arise, is such, that the rules “will be stiffened” and they cannot be will be impossible observed.
With the functioning of the previous rules the controlled enterprises are tied with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in the fact that any nonobservance of law about the public procurement indicates the breach of the budgetary discipline.
It is worthwhile to in that case tighten law thus?
I think that by not this method.
System must exclude those, who want to seize and to misuse, but not to punish those, who accomplish the formal error, which does not influence the solution.
This system will only create an even larger pressure on bureaucracy.
And whereas to leave this situation?
Give we realize, that this way anywhere will not bring.
Recently Prime Minister stated that GDP will not disturb owners by checkings of the so-called Schwarz-system. What this does mean?
“Schwarz-system” is forbidden or permitted?
To law it follows to be any means those established, and, if it forbids something, then Prime Minister cannot resist the work of organs, by which he is required to check and to seek fulfillment of commitments.
It is possible to say: “We change this law and it is permitted this”, but it cannot be indicated that we will be shut, as if nothing it occurs.
Law about the public procurement contains sufficiently strict rules, as which must formally be carried out, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, from the other side, this is tragic, when candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of the formal deficiencies.
Law never will be ideal, but to adapt it must correctly, what, in my opinion, is not sufficient.
Roads by places slippery, but in essence are passed.
In some places for the Czech Republic of road frozen and snow-covered.
In essence they are passed, but somewhere with the larger caution.
Karlovarskiy edge
In the Karlovarskiy edge of road were this morning passed, but somewhere frozen and snow-covered.
Temperature fell from five to ten degrees of lower than zero, but must gradually teplet during the day.
Snowfall in the region ceased, only at the low places lies small layer.
However, on the ridges of ore mountains lie about 30 centimeters of snow.
From information, obtained from the provincial road workers, it became known that the lower visibility because of fog was places.
High-speed highway R6 and roads of the first class in the region are at present passed without the limitations.
However, attentiveness is necessary, for example, on the bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also all roads, which relate to the second and third class, including mountain routes, are passed.
But in some of their sections still lie the remainders of that frozen and by the places of the worn out snow.
By especially attentive it is necessary to be on the roads, located on the elevations.
Pardubitskiy and Kralovegradetskiy edge
The administration for roads and highways of the Czech Republic on its pages in the Internet informs, that to some roads of the East Czech Republic threatens the ice crust, and on the mountain roads and roads, located on the elevations, can it is located the worn out layer of snow.
Provincial road workers warn drivers about the rime, which can be formed especially on the elevations of the Pardubitskogo edge.
Ice crust can be near Lanshkrouna, Usti-above-Orlitsi, Polichki, Svitavi or Visoke-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third class.
The roads of I/43 and I/34, located on Svitavi, are processed by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads to Krkonoshe also of the Orlitskie mountains.
The worn out layer of snow is located on the roads, located on the elevations in the regions Rikhnova-above-Knezhnou and Trutnova.
In the East Czech Republic today intermittent cloudiness without the sediments.
Temperature usually varies in the limits from minus of three to plus of one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzenskiy edge
Roads in the Plzenskiy edge by this are in the morning passed, but it is necessary to observe caution and to be adapted by places to the weather.
It is in the morning frosty, temperature varies from three to nine degrees of lower than zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places it can be slippery.
Drivers can encounter by places fog, but visibility will be gradually improved.
Provincial road workers granted information.
Highway D5 now passably practically without the limitations, however, the managers road recommend the manifesting of caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The majority of the roads of the first class has the dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzni and Takhove can fall the frozen sections.
The roads of the second and third class moist, and also in this case acts warning in connection with the opportunity of the appearance of slippery sections.
Drivers must be careful, especially on the little utilized roads in Shumavy region.
Olomoutskiy edge
Drivers, who are guided on the elevation of the Olomoutskogo edge, must today consider snowy porridge on the road.
It remained after the application of chemicals in the Chervenogorskom saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlskogo Krshizha.
At night snowfall forced to leave to the street of road workers, according to information from control of roads, in Shumperke fell out about three centimeters of snow.
In other regions of edge the roads are, as a rule, passed without the limitations.
“On the elevations of Shumperka lie the remainders of snow.
Drivers, who are guided for the side of Esenika, must have the presence of snowy porridge in the Chervenogorskom saddle”, reported today VAT (to Czech news agency) the dispatcher for shumperkskogo administration of roads.
At night for the clearing of roads left their colleagues from Esenika, they assured, that the roads on the elevations after working by chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomoutse the roads are passed without the limitations, but in Shternberke drivers must be attentive in the forest sections, where humidity still remains.
Ustetskiy edge, the Liberetskiy edge
This morning road workers from North Bohemia report, that several difficultly passable places remained.
According to information from the database of the police, besides several places with gololedom or fallen snow, is closed mountain road in the section from to Telnitse on Klinitse in the Ustetskiy edge.
Also temperature remains negative in the low places; therefore on the roads remains snow and glacial in the lowland, especially to the southeast from Czech Srednegorya, on the contrary, there are no problems, road in essence dry.
Thus far it does not communicate on the complications on the roads.
Road workers report about the appearance of gololeda in the environments To shteti.
According to the meteorologists, for its formation by night were created ideal conditions - entire day went rain and melted snow, at night sky explained and frost began.
It communicates about the unfavorable conditions on the main highway and on the route of I/13 on the Border of the Ustetskogo and Liberetskogo edge.
Because of the bent under the layer of the snow of the branches trees, which are concerned road itself, they were forced to bar way in Telnitse on Kninitse.
Szymon Ornest: On the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What you do think about the fact that less than in the month must begin the end of the world?
This entire-only one of many alarming news, on which we, people, so easily fall.
Tap Tap we constantly joke on this theme even we say together with the group of That we - the only group in the world, which will be able to gather sufficiently positive energy in order to postpone or to avoid the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you intend to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you in greater detail describe about this to the readers?
The discussion deals with the general national measure for the collection of means, which we plan here already for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential, which possesses the calendar of the Mayas, against end of which it is declared on December 21 in 11: 10.
In the day before this event, on December 20 in 21:00 in parallel start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrave.
They will end, speaking in general terms, at that moment, when in Kiribati island in Pacific Ocean, whose time zone for 12 hours earlier than, is completed May calendar.
Coma did come to mind this idea?
This was originally my idea, further we everything devised together with our artist of Gonzoy Augustoy.
Beside the fact that we want to accumulate sufficiently positive energy and to avoid the end of the world, we also want together with the community to think above the fact, in which state we will once communicate this peace to our children.
On occasion the end of May calendar we created the unique collection of objects from the foot-wear, sports shirts, bags and original small keys against the end of the world. These things it is possible to purchase on the site www.e-tap.cz and to thus at the same time show us support.
The group of The Tap Tap together with other musicians also carried out hymn against the end of the world, which is called “the end of the world it abolishes”.
Will sound that already catching the fancy to the listeners of YouTube hymn on these benefisnykh concerts?
Certainly, in the end itself, if as a result everything comes out and the end of the world will not begin.
It will begin to sing all executors on all concerts simultaneously.
Hymns simultaneously zazvuchat also in straight ether of Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip Tomasz Ganak, participates in execution also Xindl of the X…
How you did begin with them to collaborate?
We also collaborate with other personas of Czech cultural life, since we carry out many charitable measures and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It seemed that by many it pleases with us to work, by them it is interesting.
On that will go the gain from the concert against the end of the world?
To the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year we so work with the civil association of Tap in the institute of Edlichki.
Instructors regularly attend the students of the schools of the institute of Edlichki and take with them merry and interesting measures.
Students themselves do not have means in order to leave to the instructors, and we try thus to grant to them this opportunity.
Within the framework of the project of the additional building of the institute of Edlichki in the future will arise separately the building, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and executors will come out on each concert.
Were such the criteria of selection?
We tried to compose the program, which will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will come out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere Danom Bartas, The Tap Tap, Marianne Bango and Irzhi are dry.
About all components it is possible to learn on the site www.kpks.cz.
Do plan you any similar “mega-events” in the future?
We will in May for the first time come out at the festival “Prague spring” and let us here, of course, prepare interesting program with the interesting guests.
In the following year we with the pleasure conducted idea in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, already if we will be in the USA, greatly would want to come out in Washington and Chicago.
About the foreign countries you have serious plans, you already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group of The Tap Tap - this is group of people with the limited opportunities.
How you do manage the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??
This is not so as is terrible, as it seems at first glance.
Five participants on the electrical invalid carriages, their carriages must travel in the luggage compartment, in addition the large number of load and boxes with the tools.
Nevertheless, until they managed this without the problems. Czech airlines ČSA and British airlines of British Airways were always excellent for us prepared which how often astonished me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything passed without the problems.
You can compare the different countries from the point of view of accessibility, relation of community to the invalids and so on because of the departures for the boundary.
Which you did encounter up to the present moment?
After Madrid, Luxemburg, London and other countries, where everything functions better than, in Russia we became the witnesses of the fact that to the east of still is located on the base level.
In comparison with Prague in Moscow many barriers, and here still appear into the wonder the independent movement of man on the electrical invalid carriage in the city center.
Also there not in the course such commonplace things how to yield road to invalid in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there already appear the public organizations, which try to focus attention of people to the problems of people with the limited opportunities.
But in what, on the contrary, we constantly must overtake the foremost countries?
There are many things, the level of performance of which is far behind.
But it is important to refine that the improvement and improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, this concerns whom.
In London and Madrid it is completely normal, that people with the heavy form of disability independently are moved on the streets, they can descend into the toilet, into the museum, yes where it is convenient…
There is not very extended the fact that the large number of people with the limited opportunities takes active part in public life, in this we them from The Tap Tap a little anticipate!
The respect for community or bezbarernost - this one thing, but at the moment, when among us appear well-known athletes, artists, actors, policy or lawyers, then everything and really will begin to change.
Thus far these are the single cases - people with the strong will.
The group of The Tap Tap at present is very popular, but let us return for two years ago, which did in 1998 you force it to organize?
I entered into the institute of Edlichki as educator, around me there were many young people, which wanted to study anything.
But since I musician himself play including and on the saxophone, together with the colleague organized interesting musical circle.
Well, and in the course of time, as speaks our leading after getting along Angelovich, this a little left from under the control (it laughs).
But popularity did arrive only in recent years, or I something do confuse?
This is truth, us helped the fact that we began to be joined to the famous singers and actively to work at the propaganda of group.
We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can estimate, as if there does not exist in the essence.
We can allow ourselves the qualified instructors, equipment and so on because of the means of the European Union.
Did stand before you the purpose so to untwist well The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to make something unusual.
In show business it is full of things, imitating each other.
This is logical, entire new starts with the caution, and this lasts for long.
There exists very few rare things, but I will dare to say that Tap Tap one of them.
The first impression in man, who us sees, of course, pity, this is natural…
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with the limited opportunities are not some suffering and all neglected personalities, which we must pity.
They are people, which can live valuable life and be developed, of course, only when they possess the necessary resources.
I say that if in people with the disability something is obtained, this is shift not only for them, but also for entire society.
Did ensure success the fact that you are a strict leader, such as you do consider many?
If we want to make work qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromising and hold specific discipline.
But I consider that this is normal.
Some people to us come with the romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they learn, that two times a week they must walk on the rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and carry out much time in the road, they very rapidly lose enthusiasm.
But so it occurs in any group, which wants to work and to reach something.
At present in the composition of the group of The Tap Tap twenty people.
Their how much were at the beginning in 1998?
Only one after getting along Angelovich.
We the open group, people come and depart, this cannot be avoided.
For those, in whom is a desire the force of will, our doors are always opened.
It takes place in the day to the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 into 21.00.
Concert will pass in Prague on the stadium of Incheba, in Brno - in the club of Fléda and Ostrave - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
In the completion of concert all three cities are connected by phone conference at the moment of the performance of the song of the group of The Tap Tap “the end of the world it abolishes”.
Purpose of this project - to gather financial means in a volume of 25 million crowns to the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO with the institute of Edlichki in Prague.
Ticket to the concert costs 400 crowns, for the children of up to 12 years entrance free. Tickets can be purchased previously into Bohemiaticket.
Poland space.
Last week at the ministerial session of European Space Agency Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern block (after the Czech Republic, which it became full-fledged term EKA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close collaboration with EKA in 1994 and for the subsequent years was accepted active participation in a number of the projects of agency.
But way to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War Polish enthusiasts dealt with voyages into space, but this was not always encountered with the understanding.
I will resemble, for example, about A. Sternfeld's lecture, who on December 6, 1933 represented in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from his innovative work “introduction into cosmonautics”.
The ideas of young engineer (1905 g. r.) left the audience of indifferent, Sternfeld recalled after several years, that only the doctor Ian Gadomskiy was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France Sternfeld won reward of Robert to Esnaupeltrie and Andre Louis Khirsha for “the introduction into cosmonautics”.
The doctor Ian Gadomskiy (1899 - 1966), whom was discussed above, more lately became the great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
It published in Polish periodicals hundreds of articles and wrote the row of the books, dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskiy became the well-known world propagandist of cosmonautics, and his contribution was evaluated including by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in its honor.
In Poland was already in 1925 built the railroad trolley, equipped with rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, just as to the detail of project.
It is not clear even, for the acceleration or for braking of cart had to be used the rocket.
Information about this trolley is known only from the press of that epoch.
Since 1933 Polish artillery began to think about the rocket arrows.
A study accomplished the section of the technology of weapon with the collaboration with professors Mechislav Volfke and Gustav Mokzhitsky.
It is evident from the preserved materials that studies reached the stage of service tests.
But works were interrupted with the arrival of German troops.
In 1937 in the specialized press the idea of the photoelectric of rocket-fighter, which proposed engineer Rogozinskiy, appeared, and in the following year published work “air rocket-torpedo and aviation rocket-bomb” author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotskogo.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before war itself with all designs of the military use of rocket engineering dealt the temporary scientific-consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated entire work.
Committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended because of the beginning of war.
The following scientific work, dedicated to cosmonautics, appeared in the Polish press after war, because of the work of the Polish society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
About the society are for the first time mentioned during by Noyabrsk number of 1954 of the journal “problems”, in which are published four volumetric articles on the astronautics.
In one of them the professor of M. sub-OTOHIV proposed to organize the society, which will be occupied by cosmonautics.
At that time the designs of satellites already collected revolutions, and it was clear that space studies - promising branch.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of astronautics (POA) attempted to enter the international federation of astronautics (based in 1951), and already in autumn POA became its full member.
But in the following year the first chairman of POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the international federation of astronautics.
On this post it remained to its quite death, which began in 1959.
Since 1956 POA made the significant contribution to development of very successful sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, while the first starting took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of covering the distance of 1800 m, there were into the length of approximately 80 cm, and its weight comprised less than 5 kg.
Was subsequently built the improved version RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovskom vacant land were carried out testing two-stage rocket RM-2.
This rocket was into the length of approximately 1,4 m, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The following version of rocket was able be occupied to already by this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and observation of the wind at high altitudes was its task.
But in 1962 further development was stopped.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM became rocket Meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.
Rocket was planned as its two-step, overall length it was 510 cm, and initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Were developed three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1S), which were distinguished by the size of camera for the scientific equipment.
Rocket Meteor-1A had available space with a volume of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1S - 0, 62l.
Maximum flying distance in all three types was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 the development of rocket in the aviation institute passed Meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket Meteor-2 with a launching weight of 380 kg was capable of deriving payload with the weight of 10 kg on the height of approximately 60 km.
Then were built versions Meteor-2N and Meteor-3.
It is worthwhile to also mention about the entry of Poland in COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and creation of the national committee of COSPAR by two for years later.
Furthermore, within the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland participated in the space research on the Soviet satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevskiy became the second interkosmonavtom after Vladimir Remek.
The cancellation of law about the social activities - this is not the solution of problem.
Last week Constitutional Court annulled law about the social activities.
Decision caused the lively discussion in the society.
Undoubtedly, it will interestingly look at this problems from a wider point of view.
the Liberal-oriented economic systems in the European Union, just as in globalizovannom peace, are based on the principle of the plural, uncontrolled economic competition.
In the essence this means that the separate economic subdivisions, national economic systems, are found in a constant conflict with each other.
This is connected with the principle of free trade and free, with anything unconfined motion of the private capital together with the unbridled financial speculation.
Price stress appears as a result of the substantial difference in the cost of labor force (wages).
By this concept it is necessary to understand the state, when producer by means of the delivery of budget item tries to withstand in the economic competition by the fact that he " brings down” the cost of competitor for the purpose to take away to himself the large part of the market and to, thus, increase his own income.
On a mass scale this indicates for the majority of owners either the transfer of production for the boundary or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result rises unemployment in those in the countries, where the cost of labor force, in comparison with others, high.
Since the private capital bears no social responsibility, including for unemployment the produced by it, the inevitable expenditures of state for social needs grow.
As a whole, the situation strengthens the unwillingness of gentlemen of owners to pay taxes and to thus compensate the public economic and social damage, applied by them in pursuit of profit.
Situation is so well known that it is not necessary to cite concrete statistical data.
The unceremonious methods of the private capital are created at the level of the economies of the individual states of the situation, when the governments of the countries are forced to enter into the competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population for the purpose of attraction into the country of the foreign capital.
In other words, governments return their own population to the arbitrariness to the private capital, in spite of the social decline.
This finds, first of all, its reflection in changes in the current legislation.
Purpose it is to economically force its people to obey the dictates of the private capital, first of all in the region of wages.
This acts as the system of economic coercion in the case of the long-term unemployment and it at the same time serves as the tool of urezaniya of the rights of workers in the sphere of working legislation.
As a result rises the level of poverty, and at the same time also the difference between the poor and rich.
IN the FRG already for several years there is a public distribution of the products poor, which one cannot feed itself by its own labor.
A quantity of these people already approaches million.
Within the framework of an increase in the competitive ability of German economy constantly occur the cases, when the job-placed people obtain such wage, which state to them must pay the remainder so that they would obtain the subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal became known to community, also, in the case of the additional workers of Bundestag.
Economic measures practically in all southern states the European Union, undoubtedly, lead to the same state, in which the people, which are found under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in social status, are forced either to emigrate, as this was in the 19th century or exist to the beggarly wage in the rear of society in the hope, that sometimes into the country will arrive particular investment capital.
However, it does ask itself, from where it will undertake?
If capital arrives from other countries the European Union, then poverty move of one country into another, or it will not arrive generally, since Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turk, marokkanets, Egyptian, African still work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns entire Latin America.
The liberal theory and mass media to nausea assert that the state cannot participate in capital of her own economy, that the managed economy leads to the economic catastrophe.
The private capital persistently insists on what the state must not by the controlling actions interfere in the economy.
Further one should answer a question, does not act the private capital, now practically manager of policy and thereby entire state, for her own selfish purposes?
Single-valued answer - yes.
Existence of the practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states is proof.
As result we have the endless situation, which is manifested in corruption, the guarantee of the mutual advantages, in the legislation, where practically everything deserves punishment; however, it is not crime.
IN the FRG the situation is such, that the state ministries because of the shortage of financial means charge the development of bills to the particular law firms, which are tightly connected with the industry.
Bundestag asserts then these bills.
All power proceeds not from the people, as says Western type constitution, but from the financial-powerful groups, which prefer its own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy now rapidly occurs in this situation as this described by Appianus in the work “crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey”: “State has already long ago been decomposed, and departments deal with violence.
Bribes, illegal obtaining of favors with the aid of the stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people it walked to the selections with the previously sold voice ""… considerable people generally they were not a candidate to the post of ruler, finally once state for eight months remained without the consul”…. “seriously they began to speak, that only rescuing in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need of the selection of energetic person”:. Appianus thought that this there will be Pompey, but Caesar, who finally replaced democracy to the autocracy, became them.
As in the antiquity, in the contemporary society predominate her own reckless interests without taking into account public interest.
The private capital is not already in its essence intended for the application for public purposes.
Present result does not differ from the past: the unprecedented decline of elite without any effort to conduct the reforms of deeper nature.
Mean the reason for the appearance of the Fascist and Communist regimes we they must search for in the reckless liberalization of economic systems 19 and 20 centuries.
Today the absence of these regimes and existence of liberal type democracy can be received as the specific pause, after which is expected the following stage.
Is first of all tragic the fact that the current elite completely ignores consequences into hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophes, which we even now observe, together with the crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The cancellation of law about the social activities is not the solution or, at least, not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both on the international and at the national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic it will be forced to continue to search for ways for further decrease in the social level of population.
Thus this tendency bears system nature.
The purposeful political and social reforms, which will make it possible to strengthen the shared participation of state in the economy, are the solution, will strengthen the role of citizens in management of state and will weaken the sole position of the private capital in the society in favor of state.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
“The violence nothing it will leave, and never can leave” - Sting, song “brittle”, where the words are the main verse of refrain: “we do not forget, what we brittle”.
“If my sons would not want wars, them were not” - dying Gutel Shnaper, wife of Meera Rotschild's Amshela.
Last wave of violence between Israel and throttle control, as always, caused many responses.
Some speak in favor of Israel, arguing its position fact that it has right to the self-defense, and Palestinians appear in the role of terrorists, others they support Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of Israeli state, by genocide, perfected above the Palestinian Arabs, and the role of terrorist state is assigned of the State of Israel.
I do not want to reflect about that, who in these periodically repetitive waves of murders - criminal, but who is victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the been self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and they were not the witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My purpose - this to propose at the readers to glance for the curtain, to look to that, whom, first of all, serve the lasting already 95 years stress (counting from the signing of Balfour's declaration in November 1917) in the small section Near East earth.
Some my reasonings are reinforced historic evidence, some of them are brought out on the basis of my own understanding of that, who or what group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity - this is, first of all, the history of power contest.
In each epoch we can find the same of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - always whether these people completely independently undertook their steps, or someone stood after their throne, who directed their actions to the previously intended targets.
One should assume that we live during the period in which world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and authority resulting of them could not occur for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families it is allotted by one, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (I do not know, it does stand someone above them, but this it is not excluded) - Rotschilds.
Much do not write about them.
It is understood.
The first news agency (Reyters) they purchased already in the 90's 19 centuries in order to end the rumors, which connect their name with the criminal actions in the influential circles, in shadows of which they were located, and which always led to strengthening of their authority, increase of wealth or simultaneously both to that and to another.
In them are located the large shareholdings almost in all Central Banks of peace, and against the countries, in whose Central Banks they do not have available their portion, they Veduta or prepare the war (to the invasion into Afghanistan was only of 7 countries, after invasion into Iraq it became 5 countries, after the overthrow by Gaddafi it remained only four; however, at the same time Russian government took the Central Bank of its country in its hands).
Any, who attempted to resist this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve status of the Central Bank for the Rotshildovskim of Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to let out his own (understand - government) money and it was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to let out his own money and wanted to cancel FED (the Federal Reserve), it was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to give to the court to FED for unbinding of great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst of world authority in the period since 1859 until 1871 led to the development of the plan of three World Wars, created by the great freemason of the 33rd level by Albert Payk.
The destruction of monarchist states in Europe was the task of the first war, the second had to destroy the colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third must lead to the reduction of world population approximately to 0,5-1 billion people (this quantity of slaves it will be sufficient for guaranteeing of their comfort and luxury, and they they will not consume many resources), creation of the united universal religion (ecumenicalism it cannot be anything different, except as by prerequisite for this project) and final seizure of absolute power.
By the method, with the aid of which works the group of the richest families headed by Rotschilds, appears the call of crisis and subsequent proposal of the solutions (order ab of chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are false and always Veduta to worsening in the situation (see the base FED, which it had to avoid the repetition of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).
Thus after they succeeded in unleashing the First World War by means of the murder of the gabsburgskogo heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand into Sarajevo, they they destroyed tsarist Russia, after beginning Bolshevik revolyutsiiyu.
The First World War ended with the sudden, unjustified in military and economic sense surrender of Germany (no longer there was need for war for the destruction of tsarist Russia) and, as a result, it occurred the breaking up of Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
For facilitating unbinding the Second World War the bankers and policy created the concealed conflict situation, after putting in Germany enormous military reparation, than they created prerequisite for radicalization of the become poor masses, then it remained to only toss up the Germans of sufficiently strong, revealing the guilty and proposing the simple solutions leader, to further create multinational Czechoslovakia with the strong German minority, which it had to play, and it actually played the function of the fifth column, during kindling of the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century Rotschilds provoked the base of the Zionist motion, whose one branch they attempted to create Jewish state, it is desirable in the region of historical Israelites with Jerusalem as its capital (return in Zion).
Balfour's mentioned above declaration created prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, began to occur the first collisions with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred from both sides.
The Second World War flared up, it is difficult to estimate, was pulled out Hitler from the chains, in which it originally held the bankers, or everything that it made, it was planned, in any event the sufferings of European Jews in the concentration camps created prerequisites for the acknowledgement of Jewish state as the world community.
Israel was officially based in 1948 and, similar Germany was provoked by military reparation to the 2nd World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed in order to create the seat of war of the third.
If for international bankers succeeds in it untying, Jewish people, as in the Second World War, it will become the victim of military operations on the front line, now already together with the Arab or, simply stated, Muslim population of the Near East.
Israel - this as if gigantic laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only sharp separation of people into the supporters and enemies of Israel).
Who is guilty, while who is victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the offence does generate offence in the endless chain of violence, if everything did begin from greediness of the individual persons and their tendency toward the world authority?
It is here necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as, international bankers slip to people for the voting on the selections of exceptionally our own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu's hawk is the typical example of Fascist, loyal to international bankers by politician, making all in order to begin the war with Iran, which, because of membership of Iran in Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan…), it will threaten develop into world conflict, and taking into account the control of Iran over the Ormuzskiy strait, which contains 20% of all world oil stockpiles (navigable corridor it is altogetheronly 2 miles by width), it will also lead to the destruction of world economy.
In what light are now manifested the words, said by David Rockefeller in 1994: “Everything which to us is necessary - this is general crisis, and people will accept new world order”.
New world order in their idea - this is peace of gentlemen and slaves.
Peace, where the remaining part of the human population serves the handful of financial aristocracy, which is delighted in by comfort.
Peace, where to each born organism with the generation they implant the chip, with which it becomes essence, which is under the total control.
“Forces all small even larger, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on the right hand either on the forehead mark, so as to man, who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by number of his name, could not either buy or to sell.
It is here in what the wisdom: each, in whom there is reason, can calculate the number of beast.
Since it corresponds to name human, and this number - six hundred sixty-six.
Film “operation “of slang”: When worse nowhere, cause Hollywood
In November 1979 the crowd of Islamic student-demonstrators took the embassy of the USA in Teheran and took in hostages 52 diplomats.
They had to be freed in exchange for the thrown down Shah of Mohammed the cuts of Pahlevi, who ran after revolution in the USA, which were the patron of his regime during the decades.
The positive outcome of situation was not assumed for the US Administration - it could not afford to reject Shah outside, because this in the root could blow up the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to reach the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of theocratic regime, it was not in the state.
This was impact on the prestige of the United States, which later was intensified by the unsuccessful attempt to free hostages by force.
The concluded diplomats were finally freed 444 days, after talks with the mediation of the government of Algeria.
Their fate caused houses the wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
Defeat in Iran to a considerable degree contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter on the presidential elections of the 1980's year, which were completed by the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, srezhessirovannyy by actor by Ben Affleck “operation “of slang” describes one of the episodes of that history, which brought to America small victories.
For six workers it was possible to run out not long before the occupation of embassy.
After complex troubles they finished their way in the residence of the embassy of Canada.
The CIA in the collaboration with the Canadian authorities it was possible to take away them from Iran, in this case helped the extravagant legend of cover, according to which they left along the Canadian passports as the members of the film crew, which sought out in the country place for the surveys of science fiction epic.
Combination of the genres
The plan, which invented the expert for “the evacuation” of Tony Mendes, required the collaboration of Hollywood.
So that the legend would be reliable, in the specialized periodicals it was written about the project of film, press conferences were arranged, the fictitious production company had real office.
The details of operation long time were held in the secret, film, was based on the memoirs of Tony Mendesa.
Affleck's film - this is the special combination of several genres.
From one side, real political thriller, the so-called “film-kinoopus”, the history of successful undertaking, shady transaction - an example can be the row of films about the friends of Oushena.
In the film constantly change the moods - from one side, documentary planned scenes from Teheran (in the captions are shown the sign historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no large differences in this).
From the other side, facilitated are the Hollywood fragments, which are interesected irony and moderate exaggeration.
But then other scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other establishments - man in the suits discuss situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of establishments, on the telephone…
For Ben Affleck it was noticeably possible to make a restart of career.
From the ridiculed actor he became the respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of mockery.
“The operation “of slang” its third full-length film, after dark detective “good-bye, detka, good-bye” (2007) and thriller “city” (2010).
At the same time this is the first film of Affleck, who is not removed in the home town of director - Boston.
A feeling of the atmosphere of place in this case relates to the qualities, which raised the earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck this manifests in “the slang”, where Canada " plays Teheran”.
The best scenes in the film occur on the streets, with reconstruction of real events - the entrance scenes of a drop in the embassy impress by their clarity, which also transfers to the emotion of confusion and unpredictability, which appear, when history somewhere suddenly changes.
Similar effect Affleck and his colleague they reach in the scenes of those invented (false staff in the Teheran market).
There are too many processes in too many places.
For director it was necessary to deal with the fact that the narration does not assume many gripping scenes of cinematographic value.
It sufficiently successfully works with this few, sometimes something finishes considering - there all this leaves not so elegantly (scene, in which phone call in America it prevents the moved crisis in the airport of Teheran, and pursuit on the takeoff and landing strip they appear sufficiently nadumanno).
A drawback “in the slang” is the absent-mindedness, connected with the need for showing too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Gudman in the role of Hollywood colleagues is actually very charming; however, their characters would deserve larger space, but they in the film far from only.
It is not sufficient to Affleck's film a little dramatic nature, this is the film, which can be looked with the moderate interest, evaluating setting and retro-style, which recreates the thrillers of the seventieths.
But it seizes with difficulty.
However, this it is sufficient for reminding about one, still in a certain sense living history, and also for the evidence of that how ideas about the omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence agencies are exaggerated.
Rules of the inflation of the balloons, bananas and the circus
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, the yearly conducting interrogation about the most absurd bank collections, now decided to declare competition to “most absurd decision or project from the workshop of the European Union”.
“Us spodviglo to this the last event, in which the European Union plans to accept 40-percent quota for the women in the administration of important European companies”, stated “to right” the organizer of questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among absurdities the already advanced to the nomination - recent resolution of the European Court for the association of the rate of insurance payments for the men and women.
Until now, of woman had the privileges to life insurance, because for the insurance companies they are objectively less subjected to risk.
“Further improbable ideas from the workshop of the European Union people can advance to the competition prior to the end of this year.
Voting itself it will pass to the end the February 2013”, said Nager.
The questionable orders the European Union include, for example, the required addition of biological component in the fuel-, which as a result damages on nature, and also prohibition to the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small quantity of dangerous substances, or directive about the size of cell for the hens, in consequence of which in this year substantially became dearer eggs.
Criticism also underwent actual prohibition to the use of a term “buterbrodnoe oil” or withdrawal from sale of classical lamps.
Qualitative bananas must be the length of 14 centimeters.
Pan-European apparatus will frequently deliver verdict under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels usually protect by any state or group of the states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of veta it defends the requirements of its banks).
The interests of lobby are such: for example, the bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach length in 14 cm and they did not dare to manifest “anomalous curvature”.
In this case the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonizes the existing separate national rules, which complicated trade.
The European Union, in spite of the resistance of some states, it nevertheless softened the standards, which are concerned fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directives will lead to the dissipation of products.
Candidate for the gain in the interrogation can become the last year's decision the European Union, according to which the sold air balls necessarily must be supplied with warning about the fact that the children of younger than eight years cannot inflate them without the care of adult.
The European Union it turned to the American studies, in accordance with which air balls with the game are the potential cause of death of children by means of the suffocation.
A similar limitation now applies to children of up to 14 years, by which it is forbidden to blow into fair dudelki.
Amusing ideas are born and the house
Sufficient to absurd appears the rule, which is concerned most European officials: each, who has in the European Union any official post, cannot, taking into account the delicacy of theme for Greece, to use a name of Macedonia, but it must instead of this tell “in BYURM” (former Yugoslavian republic Macedonia).
The portal of Bankovnípoplatky.com in the collaboration with the association of liberal economists “principle of nonintervention” (Laissez Faire), proposed for the voting, besides several above absurd rules indicated, for example, rule the European Union about the volume of food reserves in the territory of membership state.
The European Union established the maximum volume of the levels of subsistence, which can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently the Czech Republic exceeded the, for example, established volumes of the konservirovannykh fungi, for which large penalty threatened to it.
The organizers of questionnaire also interested the idea to pay some countries for the fact that they do not have sea, and idea about the assignment of subsidies for the statement about obtaining of subsidies.
But these ideas arose in Prague, but not in Brussels.
“We are located at a great disadvantage, because we do not have sea.
Let us request the European Union about compensation”, stated in the fall of 2004 the then agriculture minister Yaroslav Palas (CHSDP).
It indicated as the argument that in the country there was the high harvest of grain, and the so-called interventsionnykh purchases state as a result had the complete storages of the reserves, which must be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is located far from the ports, the European Union, according to Palasu, it had to pay us hundreds of millions of Euros.
The as a result European Commission went towards the Czech Republic, organizing tender to the purchase of grain from the countries, which do not have an access to the sea.
Subsidies for obtaining the subsidy proposed to villages ministry for regional development, directed by minister Pavel Nemtsem (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go for the composition of statement on the subsidy from Brussels.
European Union: Whimsical orders are the exception
Although the decisions in the member states easily become the object of criticism, effort the European Union for regulation, and also on the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, faster acknowledgement deserve.
Serious problem, in the opinion of the experts, is the dipping of grants the European Union to the projects, which do not have even hint to something general with the deepening of the European integration; however, which member state they attained with the consideration of budget.
Are caused the emotions among the Czechs and that the fact that as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, it not always winning in this contest.
Although the Czechs after six years of combat with the Germans and by Austrians preserved designation “Olomoutskie syrki” however “Tuzemskiy rum”, whose traditions in our country depart by roots into 19 century, our producers had to rename to “Tuzemak”.
Be called rum can only products from the cane distillate, but not of the sugar beet.
In the official list of the registered products the European Union, together with world famous by cheeses “feta” and “gorgondzola”, marzipan from German Lubeck or Parma ham, already proved to be, for example, karlovarskie blocks, pogorzhelitskiy and trshebonskiy carp and zhatetskiy hop.
Also of trade mark the European Union can be proud pardubitskiy cake and gorzhitskie small tubes.
People want so that I would protect the republic, but I lover, it asserts Okamura.
Mr. is the senator, as to man it does occur to be a candidate to the post of the President?
I do not think about very becoming the senator or President.
If in our country everything would function without the problems, then I anywhere was not a candidate.
But I no longer can look, as the country plunders in the last 20 years, as thieves here fuss, to people increase taxes and retirement age.
I did not have ambitions to be politician.
But when I see something which me does not please, then I attempt to find the solution, as this to change.
But since to me has already been carried out forty years and I the independent person, who relates not to what party, i do not have another opportunity to influence thing, except as to be a candidate to the post of the senator or President.
You fell in the senate, but soon they left for the presidential lock.
Are not turned you thus by back to the people, which you did select?
I always said that I will be included in fight for the presidential lock depending on election result into the senate.
Later I specified that if I will be selected by the senator, then I will be a candidate in the Presidents.
My purpose is not post, post - this the tool, with the aid of which I can carry out my views.
Therefore i are necessary the naibolshee influence and the widest authorities.
But difficulty not only in the fact that we as nation grumble in our bar or in television, but in this case they are ready to trample anyone who will try something to change.
To this they are added by the media outlets, which man ochernyayut, and which confuse freedom of speech with the freedom of lie.
For example, about me they indicated that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was adviser Irzhi Paroubeka.
Let us pass to your views.
Fight for the presidential lock you began with the theses about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about the reverse property declarations for the sum higher than twenty millions.
In order this to carry out, it is necessary to change law.
You as the President such authorities do not have, and only entire senate can propose laws.
How you do want to solve this task?
When I as the citizen lobbied that so that conducting excursions would become free enterprise, this was possible to move forward.
Problem consists in the political intrigue - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or to the right, obstacles intentionally make to it, and this holds in control citizens.
As the independent nonpartisan person I have much larger potential for obtaining the support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage in the fact that I without party raskladyvaniya on the shelves, without caution for the dogmas can take in each party that what is best for our country, and to use this.
You do consider yourselves man, it is more by those relating to the right or to the leftists?
From a Czech point of view it seems me that me people carry faster to the leftists.
For me it is not generally important - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me so that we dispatch forward.
The discussion deals not with that which someone relates to the right, but someone to the leftists, I want to combine people.
I will always support any good for the society solution, will propose his KPCHM or to GDP, and I in exactly the same manner will be against the poor idea.
You are angered, when someone indicates that you are Populist.
But do not prove you this to those that you did say?
When you create business-plan for the firm, in you are also some ideal purposes the views.
And you try to approach this.
It is possible to name this populism, but all proposals, about which I speak, they already function in the world, or prominent experts speak about them.
But without the support of parliament to you will remain only slogans.
But you for long will not be held with this in the policy.
Or you do think that when you will leave to the people and you will have a talk with them, then for you will succeed in realizing criminal and material liability?
I do not have another opportunity.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and community and to attempt to entice them to its side so that we would attain our.
If I was selected by the President, then it would not comprise problem to organize straight television relaying, into which I will turn myself to the chairmen of parliamentary parties with the call to legalize material and criminal liability for the politicians, public servants, judges and attorneys.
And they, in the case of failure, had to report, why this they do not want.
If there will be the strong personality, which will record abuses, then it will be possible to show pressure on the political scene.
Take straight Presidential elections - this was the merit of pressure from the side of community.
I indicate directly that I am lover, but not genius and not intellectual.
I try to search for allies in order to defend its persuasions and views.
I only beginning in the policy, and for my program will attempt to obtain the support of majority.
I attempt to move independently the matters; when this will not succeed, in six years I will finish and will return to the private sector.
This partly sounds in the manner that as if Okamura must save the Czech Republic.
I am any not rescuer.
I know that one I nothing will make; therefore I went around the number of well-known people with the proposal to be a candidate into the senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused in connection with the large volume of work.
Also I at least supported the chief investigations woman journalist to Ian Lorentz, who opened swindle with the light fuel petroleum products.
I advanced my candidature because people and it is really not satisfied, but now I perceive itself on the weights.
Sixty percent of people do not send to the selections, but the majority of those, who went they selected the representatives of establishment.
Us independent in the senate only two.
People selected the senate so that the changes will be achieved with difficulty.
In spite of this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the straight selections of mayors and governors.
You do think about the base of our own party?
I yet did not think about this, because i do not have time to that in order to check the cleanliness of past each potential supporter, and i do not have any to this of money.
There is no money, also, to the presidential campaign, on my transparent calculation only twenty thousand crowns.
You do not have money?
You do speak about the property declarations, and as do proceed your own matters concerning this?
The personal effects is evaluated approximately at 60 millions.
In me is a section in Prague with the cost of approximately 25 millions, the apartment to 10 millions, one additional apartment to 8 millions, the collection of the works of art by approximately 10 millions, Aston-Martin to 3.5 millions and the damage of Superb to million, well still several million on the calculation.
By the way Aston-Martin in me appeared, because this was my malchishechya dream - me always pleased Dzheyms Bond, who drove in the machine, there was galanten with the women and at the same time it fought with the meanness and lawlessness.
You do drive on Aston-Martin, you do manage property to 60 millions and you do not have money to the campaign?
You say that you want to change republic, but its own money especially into this to pack you do not want.
This is not very convincing.
I do not have 15-TI of millions to the campaign.
I must get in into the debts?
In the campaign I put already 2.5 millions.
The fact that i do not have sponsors, attests to the fact that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obligated to pay for the pre-election campaign from my pocket.
Expenditures for campaign to me in the essence will cover senatorial wage.
But to these money I did not live, for example, it could not pay son for the English school, which stands 30,000 monthly.
If I wanted to only earn money, then anywhere he was not a candidate.
It does mean, further you will be occupied by enterprise so that it would be possible to live?
Perhaps you did not say that you will reduce this activity?
But this does not depend on the amount of wage.
As I promised, I partially decreased my activity.
For example, the managing director of tourist agency will in spring become my deputy.
People would want, that I was bessrebrennikom, which will store republic.
But I also should to something live.
How much, as owner, you did become accustomed to obtain monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that I obtain even further.
But if I would become the President, then its enterprise would finish.
Complete interview you will find in the Saturday release of the newspaper “right”.
The architects of MVRDV prove, what present adventures are not only in the imagination - based on the example Speykenisse and its recently constructed book mountain - 2 photographs
“To me this building seems merry, it appears futuristichno, at long last in us again it is possible to see something interesting”, tells Lizette Verkhayg, passer-by on the edge of road.
But Stephan Spermon, specialist in IT in the located hereabout important enterprise, counts as follows: “No, this building is actually beautiful”.
But I ask itself: why to us today one additional library?
In all is the Internet, iPad and e-books.
Now already no one voluntarily does walk into such old-fashioned libraries, it is correct?
Speykenisse, to maloprimechatelnomu sleeping town in the environs of Rotterdam, belongs uncommon record.
Its population by number 80,000 people have the very low level of formation in the Netherlands.
With this annoying circumstance several years ago it was for dealing decided to make a contribution to the general formation and to construct seven fictitious bridges, which were depicted on the bank notes of the Euro, in the form of the picturesquely painted miniatures from the reinforced concrete.
The success of this enlightenment initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of city understood that the only opportunity to overcome the statistics remained in them: to construct here library!
Blame Maas from rotterdamskogo architectural bureau MVRDV, the master of daring bar graphs and the author of ingenious, sometimes even cynical buildings, it related to the task with its usual imperturbability and appeared during competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and grin on face.
And thus far the terms of judges ozadachenno were examined and pressed by arms, audacious Maas accumulated from his original gift pyramid according to the size and completed the speech in defense of his project by the following words: “Respected townspeople!”
Here is it, my proposal: “Book mountain” into Speykenisse, so-called Bukenberg!
This mountain with the cost of 30 million Euros grew after nine years.
It is the aspect of the project of revitalizatsii, which includes also underground garage, supermarket, mail several adjacent to them apartment buildings and taunkhausov on the whole to 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November “book mountain” was noted by the second reward of competition “best library of the Netherlands 2012”.
Also project participates in the national Dutch competition of the wooden construction of 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which before could not propose anything, except postmodern pedestrian zone and amazingly plain town hall, whose white facades suggest about the dairy, it became more richly by one contemporary work of architecture.
But the main thing is in Speykenisse appeared first in the history of this town public building of cultural designation.
Long road to the book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cap for the cheese.
Here only one elevator, which passes in the center of mountainous area, indeed the real worshippers of architecture and reading will prefer to investigate this locality on foot.
Accomodation glazed from all sides - bright and easily visible, hems from the fired brick and elegant street lamps error-free create the sensation of public urban area.
Urban environment is recreated ideally.
View involuntarily searches for benches, dogs and the football boys and girls.
And everywhere - the book, the book, the book.
“Usually book regiments stand along the facades, and in the middle is arranged with large the dark hall, as a rule cheerless and faceless”, says blame Maas.
We placed the classical configuration of space from the feet to the head and took out zone for reading from within outside.
The internal space of book mountain is used skillfully: in the center are arranged offices, the Internet-library, chess club, ecological center and technical accomodations.
Especially gladden the black book regiments, which serve first as finishing walls, first by parapets, then by stairs rails.
Their form, texture and smell are uncommon.
Even the experienced architects and building engineers are lost in the guesses, however, that this behind the unknown material.
“We attempted to work with the second materials”, explain Yop It trauborst, the leader of project, Speykenisse presenting community, in accordance with the requirements of standard.
And once in one agrarian enterprise in Frislandii we met the suitable by-product of agriculture.
Already many years in the hot-houses and in the fields in the Netherlands as the backing under the roots adapt the artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness.
This cheaply and economizes time.
Thin textile serves one-two seasons, after this it is possible to eject it.
For the library this fabric - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed in the panel by thickness four centimeters.
Under the action of heat and pressure so-called landbauplastik (KLP) is converted into the dark, uniform, durable material, on the smell a little resembling new car and a little athletic shoe.
To the top of Veduta of 105 steps.
The one who will overcome way with the length of almost 500 meters, will be compensated in the literary cafe not only by fantastic view of city, but also by Dutch croquets and by wood ficuies in the pots.
They worry about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of air on the literary mountain.
Expenditures for the new soul
“It is difficult to believe, but this building, in spite of many glass surfaces, is model project in the plan of ecology”, he says It trouborst.
For its heating and cooling the heat of the earth is used.
Although the book mountain stands under the bell jar, even during the clear days the sun falls inward only temporarily.
Wide farms from kleenoy wood, located perpendicularly to glass facade, give shadow and is picked up the large part of the solar rays.
Climate in the accomodation is very pleasant.
Full-automatic roll blinds ensure remaining protection.
Stephan Spermon, which was being mentioned above skeptic from the sphere IT, already visited new library.
Lizette Verkhayg also was already here.
But also the instructor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who named Bukenberg “the soul to Speykenisse, whom has long ago not been sufficient”.
Reason: after several weeks before the discovery each inhabitant obtained the invitation to endow one book of his own meeting.
These books had to occupy empty places on the regiments of the yet not completely complete library - at that moment in it there were 70,000 books.
Idea operated.
Regiments are blocked upward.
“There is nothing worse than half-empty library”, says architect blame Maas.
“I think that because of our invitation the now each inhabitant is somehow connected with this new house.
Each knows that its book is the part of this building.
Even if it serves only for the adornment.
Thus, MVRDV was possible to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speykenisse wrote its literary history.
And let they are very young and neobrazovanny.
This indeed only initial point for constructing the identity.
Sabo: “Germans must play more important role”
Germany restrained during the voting about the acknowledgement of Palestine.
In the opinion of Stefena Sabo, expert according to the relations between the USA and Europe, entering so, Berlin balances on the narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of week Germany first gave to understand that it will vote against the claim of Palestinians to obtaining of status of observer with the United Nations.
But then Berlin restrained during the voting.
Why?
Stefen Sabo: Germany does not support the action of Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany it is necessary to be to careful in connection with its special relations with Israel.
But simultaneously I consider that American position it also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - in this case without coming out is too critically with respect to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also restrained during the voting about the introduction of forbidden zone for the flights.
As a result of NATO was conducted this proposal.
Of Germany it is difficult to occupy a clear position on complex international questions?
Yes, this thus.
The fact is that it is located in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely passes from the policy, which, so to speak, governed the USA, to strictly the German foreign policy.
Additionally situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans lacks the matched united policy.
Thus, Germans again occur between two fronts.
It is expected from them that they will play the more independent role, but they to this did not become accustomed.
I consider that until they only grope their role, but they are located on the way to “to more normal” foreign policy.
To such foreign policy, as France or Great Britain carries out.
However, what does specifically indicate “normal” foreign policy from a German point of view?
This is the readiness to occupy the position, depending on the US position or European partners, in its national interests.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e., from the export and connections with the defined regions, by such as Russia, China or the Near East.
The economic interests of Germany to a considerable degree differ from the interests of other important states, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did influence these economic interests the position in the Middle Eastern conflict and the voting in the United Nations?
First, Germany has the large markets for sale in the Near East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore it should manifest caution in order not to insult community and elite in the Arab countries.
In any event this plays its role.
But I did not give to this of too great significance, this is not completely one-way communication.
But in any event this plays important role in the calculations of Germans.
Did do harm Germany to its relations with the USA, abstaining during the adoption of the decisions of major importance, such as voting about Palestine?
I am confident, that in Europe and even in the USA predominates understanding German position.
Therefore I do not think that this was the same dramatic break, as in a Libyan question.
Possibly, Germany even will acquire the determined respect thus.
Indeed this it signals about the fact that it should be received seriously as the player in the international arena and that it is necessary to consider its interests.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The USA, on the contrary, clearly supported the veto.
There is a divergence of opinions between the USA and many European states?
Such differences existed always in view of American domestic policy.
I consider that Obama's government in the depth of soul has a sufficient understanding of European position.
But in connection with the local political situation government, of course, cannot openly occupy this position.
I believe that the essential divergences in the opinion are not entirely so significant, as always it is represented.
If you examine the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then you will note that Obama entirely not in the enthusiasm from the politicians Netanyahu.
Is easy whether Germany to combine its close connections with Israel and USA from one side and the position of the most important partner in the European Union with another?
Think, precisely, this makes the situation of such difficult for the Germans.
Certainly, to Germans there would be somewhat simpler, if there would be a united, noncontradictory European policy, but now this is not so.
Therefore they cannot come out within the framework of the wider approach and are forced instead of this to act, resting only on its own vision of situation.
Specifically, so they act with the Euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take upon itself the leading role in the production of general European position.
It is understandable that this is complex for Germany, at least because of the connections with Israel.
This theme was always ticklish.
But I think, to Germans it is clear that they must play the more independent role.
If Germany itself does see itself in the role of important international player - will not take it for itself actually main role?
Or the leading role is still heavily given to Germany?
Germany yet did not become accustomed to this, by it, until now, it is always unpleasant and, for the obvious reasons, until now, it is always heavily given to play significant role.
Let us examine, for example, the crisis of the Euro - each time, when Germany takes to itself important role, the most varied anti-German feelings are manifested.
To Germans it is not simple to manage this.
Strictly, this is the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by the hostile countries.
From this point of view Germany is located in considerably the more difficult position than by the USA.
It must take into consideration of the most different neighbors and opinion, and this is complex.
Thus, the influence of the USA in the European policy constantly does weaken, but at the given moment the European Union does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
For Germans simply it is necessary to play more significant role.
Even if you this does not please, unpleasantly or strengthens dislike to you - life is such!
Stefen Sabo - deputy director of transatlantic academy in Washington, the institute, in which the academicians and expert-political scientists from Europe and North America together investigate the problems of transatlantic association.
Furthermore, Sabo - member of the German fund for Marshall, in whom it specializes in the German policy, foreign policy of the USA and transatlantic connections.
“The protection of trade marks” in China: when Puma and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani - world famous trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren - also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is completely the officially registered in China designation, which has nothing in common with the firms, from names which it is formed.
Nevertheless it will be guarded until owners initial names produce action.
But even then it is unclear, with it will be possible to defend its rights.
“Foreigners increasingly with more difficulty begins himself to protect their trade marks in China”, say Thomas Pattlokh, attorney of the company of Taylor Wessing, which is specialized in the disturbances of rights to the trade marks in the Far East.
At my table each week it appears in the new deal of this type.
To imitators it suffices to add in all the pair of letters in order to obtain the right to register its commercial signs.
So from Gucci it is obtained by Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada it is possible to register Prada-Kny.
By the same method are legally copied German enterprises, for example the producer of sport goods of Puma.
Pattlokh opens folder with the records of the department of the registration of trade marks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010 Chinese company registered the there commercial sign of Zegna DF Puma, the artificial name, in which is used also the name of the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese - world champions of copying and disturbance of intellectual property rights, is known.
In the large cities there are the many-storeyed department stores, which sell forgeries, almost exclusively.
However, the matters of Pattlokha are not such. On the commission of its constituents it speaks against Chinese enterprises would completely officially obtaining from the department of the registration of trade marks the right to use the name, which has already been guarded somewhere still.
Chinese call this “the ban of minpay”, stamp-passenger.
This word is associated s “the ban of dakuan”.
So call the women, who hunt for the rich men.
Chinese authorities are not recognized after itself fault
“This does damage to business, with this it is necessary to fight”, is convinced Pattlokh.
“Trade mark is eroded, unique position is lost, image very strongly suffers”.
Financial losses and processual expenses in the injured branches are calculated by million, especially in the case of the expensive copied products.
According to the data of company for market researches CLSA, China with a volume of sales of 15 billion Euros is per year the third according to the size and very rapidly growing market for the sale of the objects of luxury.
However, to attain the removal of doubtful records in the list of commercial signs is difficult, and costs this dearly.
Process can last of up to nine years, with the obscure outcome.
Pattlokh tells about the matters, in which the court slanted actions, since after the long time the protested name became “realia of market”.
If to plaintiff it does not transport, then it even will be must pay plagiarist, since damage to its commercial sign in China applied, speaks Pattlokh.
Law of the jungle sometimes here guides.
There are also the famous matters about the adornments.
In 2009 the company of Daimler lost judicial dispute with the producer of the construction vehicles of Sany, enterprise, which not long before that acquired the firm-producer of the concrete feeding pumps of Putzmeister.
Therefore Chinese, until now, have the right to use the emblem, similar to the star of Mercedes.
Company of Geely the purchased Volvo initially used the bluish white logotype, which resembled BMW; process was successful, Geely it was necessary to change it.
The producer of fashionable goods of Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked into the other side.
Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The department of the registration of trade marks CTMO in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of the shortage of personnel and equipment of accomodations they there took place of difficulty.
But in the past year occurred “the return from the emergency in the working process to the standard”.
Thus, a quantity of unprocessed matters for objections decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such matters was closed, 75 percent higher than in the past year.
Nevertheless 81,500 claims still wait production in the department.
To fight with this is expensive
As very frequently in China, numbers impress.
In the past year in CTMO entered more than 1,4 million statements about the protection of commercial signs, almost to third greater than into 2010.
This record means that China tenth time contract headed the list of new registrations in the entire world, department reports.
The same concern the total number of real commercial signs, only 5.5 million pieces.
Were in 2011 paid 1.8 billion yuan of collections.
If we simplify, this means that each registration costs on the average of 1280 yuan or 160 Euros.
To protest it stands many times more, as shows the affair of the German family enterprise of Freudenberg.
For a period more than of seven years the concern fights with the Chinese plagiarist.
For Germans it was possible to attain that the illegal production by it false automotive parts was liquidated.
However, imitator fastened to itself Chinese rights to the commercial sign of Freudenberg.
This was its own omission, since surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, speaks Khanno Venttsler, the chairman of the administration of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the department of the registration of commercial signs CTMO deflected the claim of myunkhentsev.
True, in both following instances of Freudenberg it won, but contrary side continues fight, until now.
It is necessary to be on the alert
Now a question is found on the examination in the Supreme Court.
Venttsler hopes to bring the matter to a good completion and praises the professionalism of courts.
But he also speaks: “The process extremely of roads takes away much time, money and nerves”.
Internal expenditures hardly yield to calculation, for the archive of firm it was necessary to examine even reports of centenary remoteness in order to give proofs.
Five years ago of Freudenberg it without result proposed to contrary side “large six-place sum of the Euro” for the regulating.
“It is hence clear, as dearly this us costs”, says Venttsler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to throw even into Europe.
Namely when imitators will register the unprotected commercial signs there after themselves.
Thus, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the designation of Freudenberg for the foot-wear and articles made of the skin.
Concern has long ago ended production in these regions, but in spite of this it could avoid registration.
“It is necessary to be on the alert”, says Venttsler.
Both he and attorney Pattlokh recommend to German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international standings about the protection of trade marks, faster foreigners follows “everything which in any manner is worth protecting, recording also in China”, says Venttsler.
Otherwise this can manage considerably more expensive than registration.
Actually: if Freudenberg loses in the last report of its drama about the commercial sign, then it will have to pay contrary side the license fees for the proper name, is explained Venttsler.
They will otherwise us extrude from the market in the questionable segment.
World day of AIDS: to pritoptyvat, to sing, to help
In Khaydelberge rehearses the chorus of Imbongi - while in Swaziland the orphans of AIDS are glad at this.
History of the relations, which covered the distance more than 8733 kilometers.
First is heard pritopyvanie: cowboy boots, basketball athletic shoes, lady boats and men's sneakers select time on the parquet sex and rapidly find it.
Times-two-three-four.
Only after this slowly increase voices of singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they begin, they charm and follow each other.
And You fite Hopf, 29-year-old conductor, only it does not jump out from its cloth shoes, when it conducts by their flexible and expressive gestures.
The evening of Monday, in the musical hall of the institute of medical psychology in Khaydelberge the chorus of Imbongi rehearses new song.
To the rehearsal arrived fifty participants in the chorus from 23 to 69 years, from spetsialistki in genetics of man to the yard-keeper.
“Ohm " of Obani” - complex thing, each voice of chorus has his text and furthermore in the completely alien language: Zulu, on which speak eleven million people in the Southern Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Aid for the self-help
According to the estimation of Unaids, program of the United Nations according to the fight with AIDS, in the world are counted about 34 million HIV-positive.
23.5 million of them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland it lives 245 000 orphans of AIDS.
In this case more than 40 percent of population HIV-are positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village of Esitzheni the association of Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
70 of them attend the school, which prepares for further instruction.
As 15 or 20 Euros per month it is possible to take supervision upon itself.
It guarantees to the child of money for the school, school form and daily hot dinner in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means teller or praiser.
In this hall they do not tell rapidly on bow, then they know how to sing.
Almost ten years chorus learn songs in this strange soft language and it from time to time even brings them again there, where they for the first time appeared: to the south of Africa.
Indeed at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Khaydelberga, in the northwest of kingdom Swaziland, is located the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the voices of German chorus.
Forty percent are infected
There live about 2000 people, some, until now, in the simple cabins from the clay and straw, among the inhabitants there are many children.
More than 300 of them remained without the parents, who died of the virus ICH.
In Esitzheni in the miniature is reflected the disease of entire of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV-infection, the lowest in the world expected lifetime according to the data of UNICEF.
Cutting extreme flesh in men, which dokazanno decreases the risk of infection half, among the population barely accepted.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland bear in itself the virus of immunodeficiency, death on the middle of fourth ten - not rarity.
Chorus opened this village in the joint trip through Africa in the spring of 2005, but before participants in Imbogni saw many children on the streets, to which not only parental concern was not sufficient, but also it is simple in all: food, clothing, formation.
Without the school formation the man in the poor country does not have generally any chances.
First this was the particular obligation of individual participants - after several Euro to per year send child into the school and to give to it the opportunity of times in the day to obtain hot food.
But already year later chorus established association “Voices for Africa”, which from those times almost professionally worries about the orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni.
Facts about the infections, transferred through sex
Are such the most important diseases, transferred through sex?
To bacterial IPPP carry syphillis, khlamidioz and gonorrhoea (gonorrhea).
By frequent virus IPPP appear HIV, human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic pediculosis and itch relate to parasitic IPPP.
Are such the basic beaten groups?
Syphillis and gonorrhea are encountered in essence in the men, who deal with sex with the men.
The institute of Robert Koch proceeds from the fact that the minimum into four of every five cases of syphillis, registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of the sexual contacts between the men.
In heterosexual adult people the frequently meeting diseases, which are transmitted through sex, are khlamidiynye infections, trikhomoniaz, candidiasis (cap), the gonorrhea and human papilloma-virus.
Propagation HIV among the heterosexual adult comparatively low - however about 20 percent of new infections HIV is fallen to this group.
Among the young people khlamidiynye infections are encountered substantially more frequently than among other population groups.
According to European data, three fourths of all infections strike young people from 15 to 25 years.
Among the young people human papilloma-virus also frequently is encountered.
How does change the number of cases of infection?
Not all diseases, transferred through sex, are subject to required registration.
Morbidity by syphillis, according this of the institute of Robert Koch, more than it was doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 before 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new infections HIV since 2007 is reduced.
There were in 2011 about 2700 cases.
This approximately to one is tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms do indicate the venereal disease?
With the infectious diseases can appear the ulcers in the region genitalia, complaint during the urination, isolation, the pain of below stomach, and also phials or packing.
However, frequently they are not accompanied by the pains and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How it is possible to be protected?
Condoms are capable of decreasing the risk of infection, but they do not give hundred per-cent protection.
Indeed partially the agents of the diseases, which are transmitted through sex, can be extended also via contact infection, also, with the close physical contact.
Therefore experts recommend regular inspection, especially with the frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnostics it is possible to cure majority IPPP and to avoid the distant consequences.
Supervision, donations and not lastly fees for the appearances of chorus on entire Germany make it possible something to gather.
“In all we sent in Esitzheni already about 200 000 Euros”, speaks You annete Lennartts, the chairman of association.
In village itself money from Germany manages Tsodva to Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
It worries also that the orphans would be well arranged, for example in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as old women are called on the Zulu, this is the support of village.
Some of them accepted to itself to 14 orphans, they give to them roof overhead and they worry that the children in the form each day in time would appear at the lessons.
Those, in whom it did not remain relatives, enter shelter to Khaniysile, lonely woman, who obtains wage from the association, just as two cooks, which each day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, association “Voices for Africa” organized sewing school, it constructed two chicken coops and together with the American organization for the protection of health PSI organized the delivery of analysis on HIV for many inhabitants of village.
It is difficult to represent, but about the disease, which is so obvious in the entire country, they prefer deeply to keep silent.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS - this absolute taboo”, says You annete Lennartts, “because it is connected with sexuality”.
It is sufficiently uncommon for the country, in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king To msvati to the THE III, is noted for his love for the excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on this sanctioned by state style of life also lies fault for the fact that the virus ICH just as rapidly was extended in last years.
But it lies also on the vagrant workers, who resound virus in the country.
Free condoms exist literally at each angle, speaks You annete Lennartts, “but them barely they use.
Another culture - flesh to the flesh”.
In order to a little support cultural exchange, the chorus of Ibmogni every two or three years accomplishes trip on the south of Africa and sings songs, complete melancholy, combat spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which know even many on the southern edge of the dark continent from the times of apartheid.
The bus, complete of white, which sing songs in the black language - this acknowledgement not only brings good mood and happiness, but even, it occurred, tears on the eyes of severe border-guards were caused.
Trip always leads also in Esitzheni, where the singers attend sponsored children.
In spite of the fact that small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the valley of the river of Etsulveni it more than is noted for.
“Iditol in Esitzheni, there light”, say local people.
But back into Khaydelberg, when the stamping singers return to the rehearsal hall on the street of Bergkhaymer, it is possible to see after 8733-kilometer overflight which burns also this light here.
Messenger: NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) opens ice on mercury
Probe “Messenger” found the proofs of the fact that on the planet mercury is glacial.
Ice cover can have a thickness to 20 meters.
The space department of the USA of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) proved the presence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although it is located nearest of all to the sun, there also there is the frozen water, as it appears of three studies, published on Thursday in the special periodical of Science.
Probe “Messenger” found the proofs of the fact that region of planet the constantly located in the shadow was covered with ice.
Its thickness must compose the minimum of 30 centimeters, and possibly, even to 20 meters.
Supposedly, water occurs from the comet or, possibly, asteroid, that were encountered mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with existence of life on the planet, the scientific leader of probe Sean Solomon said.
Temperature on mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help to explain, as water and other construction elements of life entered other places of the solar system.
It is unnoticeable for the inhabitants of the Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example “Phoenix”, the depths of the universe are investigated.
From time to time they send to the Earth the images: small windows into the infinite gave.
Image enters from the camera, which developed the German researchers from the institute of Max Planck.
Eight planets of our solar system, and also dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which turns around the sun for Neptune, Ceres, according to the new determination of the International Astronomical Union dated 2006, it is not “planet”.
This fragment of the infrared photograph of telescope “Spitzer” presents “family portrait” of the countless generations of the stars: the oldest stars in the form of the dark-blue points, to with more difficulty identify in the starry circle the pink “newly born” stars.
This region of star formation - scientists neromantichno call it W5 - is opened by telescope “Spitzer” in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This iridescent heat of the dying star photographed the telescope of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) “Spitzer”.
More similar to the dumpling ring consists of the material, which the star rejected in the process of dying.
In the gigantic fogginess of Trifid, removed to 5400 light years from the Earth, from the gas and dust appear new stars.
The telescope of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) “Spitzer” made this photograph of galactic maternity hall.
The star cluster of pleiad, also called “seven sisters”, can be seen with at night naked eye.
Certainly, the colors are obtained better with the telescope.
As red eye winks to observer fogginess snail in this infrared photograph.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of aquarius.
Similarity to the terrestrial continent brought to this fogginess nickname “North America”.
The combination of normal and infrared photograph ensures expressive color reproduction.
This new star in the entire beauty it was possible to photograph only with the aid of the infrared sensors of telescope “Spitzer”.
Saturn and its ring: As they arose - one of the great riddles of astronomy.
Possibly, these are the splinters of the Moon Saturn, which without leaving a trace disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest photographs of telescope “Hubble”: galaxy is the whirlpool
Depending on color reproduction the photographs of spiral galaxies are converted into the present works of art.
The published by European southern observatory photograph shows thousand light years fogginess of Trifid in the constellation of Sagittarius the remote by several.
The name of Trifid originates from the Latin word of trifidus (three-lobate, tripartite), since the dark strips of dust divide into three parts the incandescent heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus the astronomers photographed the forerunner of the space collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from the Earth of the nucleus of two confluent galaxies they rush towards each other and unavoidably they will encounter.
This generation of star telescope “Hubble” removed in the spiral galaxy of M83.
That, whom do not please technical reductions, can call it on the nickname “southern lantern pinion”.
The photograph of space telescope “Hubble” shows the fragment of fogginess iris in the constellation of Cepheus.
The fogginess, removed to 1400 light years, consists of the dust particles, whose sizes from ten are to hundred times less than in usual household dust.
This image was comprised of the optical and X-ray photographs of different telescopes.
It shows the ring from the black holes, removed to 430 million light years from the Earth.
This group of galaxies by the name of Arp 273 photographed for NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) space telescope “Hubble”.
Large spiral galaxy scientists call UGC 1810.
In this starry fogginess the brightest group of the new stars of our Milky Way is located.
Starry cradle constantly creates new stars.
These are the star cloud, connected with the fogginess rosette; also constantly are created new stars - at a distance of 5000 light years from the Earth.
In this vividly luminous galaxy with the small black hole still there is no dust, only newspaper.
Researchers assume that it arose not long before the large explosion, when in the universe in essence was hydrogen.
Our views into the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem - even before Galileos Galileo by year more lately approached the observation of the stars.
The mirrors of optical telescopes became increasingly more from those times - and accessible to their view spaces increasingly are deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 until 1975, the telescope “to challah” in the observatory Palomar in the environs of San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, depicted here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, it is established “large binocular telescope”.
It makes it possible to look into space with the aid of two mirrors, each with the diameter of 8.4 meters.
“The boundary of tele-SKOPYO Kanarias” has gigantic internal device - the diameter one mirror alone it is 10.4 meters.
The mirror “large south African telescope” in the Southern Africa is segmented - for a reduction in the cost.
Nevertheless in the diameter it reaches approximately eleven meters.
Deficiency in the inexpensive design concept: telescope is rigidly fastened at vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
Telescope “hobby-Eberli” in Texas also has the fixed vertical angle.
Its special feature: the high light-collecting ability.
It reaches - in spite of a comparatively small diameter of mirror - the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
With the aid of the radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the researchers listen to the extraterrestrial signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the project “search for extraterrestrial reason” (SETI), any owner of computer can help, after granting its computational power.
View of the observatory of European astronomical service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands “very large telescope” - completely corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors make it possible to illuminate even average infrared spectrum in the telescope.
In the Chilean observatory ESO also is planned the installation of European “very large telescope”.
Its main mirror must be stretched to the entire 42 meters - and it will be comprised of the almost 1000 specular elements.
However, photographs it follows to expect not earlier than 2018.
Until 2007 both telescopes “cake” on the Hawaiian volcano of valerian of Kea were considered largest in the world.
In them are established two mirrors by diameter on ten meters.
Telescopes “cake” enter into the composition of the observatory of Mauna Kea, which together with them looks into the sky also with the aid of the telescopes “sub-ARU” and IRTTF.
Furthermore, in Mauna Kea must appear new gigantic telescope - with the mirror with the diameter of thirty meters.
To here it is possible admire by it on the illustration.
However, the most important forms from space supplies space telescope “Hubble”.
Since April 24, 1990 it supplies the pictures of distant peace.
Since March 2009 space telescope “Kepler” searches for planets beyond the limits of the solar system -, first of all, such, on which is possible the life.
On February 2, 2011 of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) it reported that 1235 planet-candidates were discovered since the beginning of the mission.
In the photograph are imprinted the last preparations of space telescope “Kepler”.
The space telescope of James Webb (JWST) will be sent for space not earlier than 2018 on board the rocket “Ariane 5”.
The main mirror of infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must on the light of the first stars and galaxies search for large explosion.
Scientists assume that at the south pole of mercury there are glacial.
However, there is no reliable data about this, since “Messenger” it revolves nearer to the north pole of planet.
Radar measurements for a period of decades indicated that on mercury there are glacial.
- To the first, which revolves around mercury - scientists now in this are assured because of the neglected in 2004 probe “Messenger”.
Drink oil each day - and live of up to 168 years
In South Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach po--Biblical honorable age.
Here even there is a museum of longevity.
The search for solution in the country, where the 97--year old men seem by also comparatively young.
In South Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach po--Biblical honorable age.
Here even there is a museum of longevity.
The search for solution in the country, where the 97--year old men seem by also comparatively young.
The trip through the Talyshskie mountains can be named wild and romantic.
Microbus with the rumble rolls along the twisting road of the by been overgrown with dense forests hills, stormy creeks and simple peasant houses.
Everything all around is so green and vividly, that it is possible to think, as if you are located in Shvartsvalde.
But this is the very southern edge of Azerbaijan, Iranian boundary is located in all in several kilometers hence.
Here they live talyshi - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which known a little, perhaps only that they wonderfully speak on Farsi and azerbayzhdanskom and differ in terms of longevity.
Terminal point is Lerik.
Small town boasts by too heavy an architecture of Soviet times, which in no way harmonizes with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe barely arrive here, road from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too tiresome.
To 323 kilometers it departs eight hours, since road has only one strip.
Legendary wealth, by which the country is obliged to oil of Caspian Sea, here, into the province, until it reaches.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that in Lerike there is how to interest tourists.
“In May Baku became famous by the festival of song Eurovision - and in the following year takes place the festival of the oldest people of peace”, says Fatulaeva.
It - the director of the museum of longevity, probably, only in the world.
Is here documented the biography of approximately eight dozen talyshey from these places, by which it is more than 100 years. Fatulaeva indicates the black and white photograph.
This is my grand-dad, to it here 120 years.
At the age of 136 years in it one additional child was born
But the questionable star of museum is the shepherd of Shirali Myuslyumov, to whom allegedly were carried out 168 years.
There is no evidence about the generation, however.
But taking into account the fact that to the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, was carried out 122 years, the age of Myuslyumova is extremely doubtful.
“It was born in this region in 1805, it died in 1973”, is explained Fatulaeva.
Man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years in it allegedly was born the daughter.
Thus did add the shepherd of Myuslyumov to vapor of tens of years to his age?
Indeed even Rembrandt Sholts, the researcher of age from the institute of Max Planck in Rostoke, heard about the veterans in Central Asia.
“Are surprising many people of old age it is possible to meet also in some regions of China, in Japan or in the valley of Khunza in Pakistan”, says Sholts, “in Sardinia also live extremely many very old people”.
However, the scientific confirmation of age is impossible because of the absence of documents, since there were no lists of civil status.
Each day is the container of boiled oil
Nevertheless there is the fact that people in Lerika region surprisingly frequently reach Biblical age.
20 people now here live older than 100 years.
Why here, in the south, so there are many veterans?
Azerbaijan guide Farid to Mugimzade explains this by the special genes talyshey.
The director of the museum of Fatulaeva, on the contrary, believes that the matter in the nourishment.
Talyshi they love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink on the container of boiled oil each day. However, hardly this high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietological point of view.
Or the matter in the primitive way of life, which does preserve to people youth? In Chengemirane, tiny settlement not far from Leriy city, lives Mirzoev's Rubaba.
In 97 years it is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaev, which asserts that in it 143 descendants, it lives in the simple wooden house, typical for entire Caucasian region.
It sits on the sex with the barrel of oil, which it rolls hither and thither without tiredness.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzaevoy, xwho long ago already have their grandsons.
Two little-ones also hereabout skip.
On the kitchen the tea, which will give in the typical pot-bellied containers to armudu, is prepared for guests.
In Mirzaevoy ideally flat and strong white teeth, under the head shawl it hides the long dark-light-brown scythes, which its son with the pride reveals before us.
I always my hair by milk, so that they fell out nor preserved never colored.
“I never used shampoo”, he says mirzaeva.
Of monthly pension is sufficient to the life
It always ate only that which grew in its own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For entire life I never bought products in the store.
Then she tells about its husband, who served in the army.
Most heavy was after the Second World War.
But it became better, when “dear father” Heydar Aliev arose in the control.
Propaganda frequently does not sound in the speech of old woman.
However, the cult, created around the figure of the father of nation, who was guided by the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan practically does not know boundaries.
It was in the authority until 2003, then brazdy of administration accepted its son Ilham.
Nevertheless among the Azerbaijan old men there is no misery.
230 manatov (approximately equal to the same sum of the Euro) of Mirzaev are obtained monthly as the pension, this is the sum for the local conditions, for which it is possible to live well.
And the, possibly, long ago grown son of the Mirzaevoy also of the rights: “Old men in our culture use deep respect”.
They live in the large family, they are loved, surrounded by concern and they are happy.
How not reason to remain in the living as is longer as possible
Word “human rights” is absent from the constitution
Revolution returned to Cairo.
The competing demonstrations in Cairo testify about the deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, met furious rebuff.
The Egyptian President was not stingy to the enthusiasm.
We must create passage.
“Its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before the god”, he said on the government television.
Its speech was inverted to entire people, but first of all to the Christian Copts, liberals, educated to Moslems and to nereligioznym Egyptians.
Indeed they all, until now, hopeless separated in the lost opposition, experience fear.
Fear before the religious state on the Nile on the favor of the powerful “Muslim Brotherhood”.
Mohamed Morsi, only whether without apologizing, said that it temporarily reduced the scope of Constitutional Court and enlarged its scope, “in order to save revolution”.
However, that 61--year engineer, who has the degree of the doctor of the US university of South California, in reality wants to save, it is not completely clear to the Egyptians and the entire world.
Will be deprived of force judicial authority?
Actually 234 articles were possible to drag through in the night 15-hour jump with the obstacles at the Islamically disposed constitutional meeting of 100 participants, and this partially causes alarm.
As in the previous constitutions, in the project it is indicated that the legal procedure rests on “the principles of Islamic right”.
But which does mean “principles”?
This was and remains the matter of interpretation, and it is possible to fear that the Islamists will use diffuse formulation and juridical gap for a stricter interpretation of Sharia appearing in connection with it.
At least, at this one newly introduced article hints: in all matters, which are concerned Sharia, should be drawn for the council university al-Ashar, most important Islamic establishment of the country, which is used the great authority in the entire Sunni Islam.
This is not must, but it can mean that clergy oversees after the legislation, which would de facto have by consequence a limitation of judicial authority.
In the draft constitution much is the object of the interpretation
One additional problem: must be preserved the jurisdiction of citizens to military court.
These courts in the period of Mubarak's authority served for the suppression of oppositionists.
After the overthrow of dictator in the military conclusion they were found to 11,000 citizens.
Also, as it is said in the project, state must guard “true essence of Egyptian family” and “support her morals and values”.
Legally this is formulated so illegibly, that the public institutions with the aid of this article can control even content of cinema and literature.
By the plain text this indicates nothing else but censorship.
Generally not one article establishes directly the equality of men and women.
Then another forbids to oskorblyat and to defame the prophet of Mohammed and his envoys.
But what is insult and as it must punish, it remains obscure.
Formulation also seems doubtful that is forbidden “the insult of people”.
Sufficiently whether it will be caricature to the President or jokes about the jurist?
A question of interpretation as much in this project, which Morsi proposes to the signature and which, according to him, “very soon” will be presented to Egyptians in the referendum.
“Revolution returned”
Already several weeks is formed opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people were collected in the uncommon unanimity in the evening of Friday on Tahrir Square in Cairo and were vowed to destroy this document even before it will be able to come into force.
“Revolution returned, and we will defeat”, said Khamdin Sabbakhi, that occupied the third place on the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former leader of international department for atomic energy Mohamed ElBaradei stated that to draft constitution place “on the dustbin of history”.
Through the service of the short news of Twitter it accused the adherents of Morsi of the desire to head “coup against democracy”.
“If it declares referendum, we will go to its palace and let us throw down it”, said the oppositionist of Yasser Said.
“We yet did not get tired, the blood of our brothers yet not of otmshchena”, cited the Egyptian mass media of oppositional politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they do not want to control referendum, which would make its ineffective.
“The Koran - our constitution”
The well organized “Muslim Brotherhood”, in turn, called to the opposite demonstration, but, from the precaution, not on Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on other shore of the Nile before the Cairo university.
In it participated the large number of women under the covers and of the adherents of the Salafis, whom they shouted: “People requires the application of a God law”.
They required from Morsi: “Burdens the country!” and they certified: “The Koran - our constitution”.
Power contest above the symbolic area, over which everything began, provoked the state of in practice Civil War.
Morsi's followers, it is completely obviously, did not want to go to this risk.
“The Muslim Brotherhood” stated that both the enemies and supporters of draft constitution expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Time now arrived to give to people to solve in the ballot-box, in what direction the country must go.
Majorities for the project of Islamists, this is considered as the solved matter.
“The concept “of human rights” is mentioned never”
Abu Saed's Khafiz in the fury from this forced constitutional process, which, in general, had to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
48-year-old attorney on human rights and chairman of Egyptian organization for the rights of man (EOPR) protected “the Muslim Brotherhood”, when during Mubarak's lifetime they sat in the prison or appeared before the court.
Not because it divided their world view, but because human rights for it were indivisible.
For this it was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
But now words “human rights” never are encountered in the new constitution, will regret it in the conversation “Welt am of Sonntag”.
The expansion of Morsi's influence on all three branches of authority in the state disappoints attorney.
These measures are explicit impacts for democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to the new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening of civil state, the President de facto annulled him”, will regret Saeda.
Indeed without the civil public organizations democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels, that everything they left its, even international community, which looks at the battle of ideas of directions on the Nile with the mixture of curiosity and stress.
The payment can begin for this.
Demonstrator on Tahrir Square prevents: “You create the monster, which you will not be able to control”.
Norwegian rakfisk: the badly reeking fish itself in the world?
In the pyatimillionnogo population of Norway one of the very high standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the entire world.
Possibly, the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local predilection to one extremely fetid fish dish?
Take several gotten overripe pieces of cheese.
You will place them into the heap of dirty and sweaty sport clothing.
Leave them there to the week.
In you will come out striking back sense of smell it smelled rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am situated in the small town by the name of Fagernes, three hours of ride from Oslo.
All around covered with snow picturesque forms. This is very beautiful, but in air ineradicable characteristic smell is spilled.
Rakfisk - this the trout, strewn I will pour off and wandered in the water up to the year, depending on that, what precisely musty smell it is necessary to attain.
As they thicken twilights even it kholodaet in proportion to, the crowds of Norwegians are collected to the festival into Fagernese, dedicated to this very, let us say so, to the gripping dish.
“It they eat damp and wash down by the wineglass of aqua vitae, local caraway vodka”, explains Khavard Khalvarsen, local fireman on the profession and on the pluralism “rakfiskovyy General”, who leads conducting festival.
Everywhere around us people eat the cut with small cubes fish and wash down by its big enough portions of alcoholic.
“Someone more pleases aqua vitae, than rakfisk”, says Khavard.
This beverage is capable to smash smell.
I try the pair of pieces.
If it will be possible to carry piece under the nose, then everything not too and badly - it differs little from the portion of land, which you for long conveyed with yourselves in the bus.
Rakfisk - this is Norwegian product from completely different times, times of the poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish they in autumn wet in the hermetically sealed barrels with salt water.
Then by the deep winter, when fish already and thoroughly wandered well, it they extracted and, after muting perception by alcohol, they used into the food.
Even on the memory of past generation the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of the work and to emigrate, mainly, in the USA.
Now population swiftly grows - more than 13% comprise the immigrants, whom the here jobs, high wages and developed system of social welfare draw.
The inhabitants of Sweden (old rival, but yet not so long ago and much more prosperous neighbor) mass arrive here to work.
Rakfisk is received as the certain important symbol, indispensable, although a somewhat fetid element of the past of Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
From the other side, here everything is dear - the small glass of beer or sandwich will manage to you into 9 of pounds sterling (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears in World News, and the majority of the inhabitants of the country is this it is, it seems, it arranges.
People, until now, unwillingly here mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and extremist of the right sense, which in the past year shot and the killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning its name, act of terror is called “happened on July 22”.
It is very difficult to believe Norwegians, that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens proved to be capable to similar atrocities and murders.
At the basis of today's prosperity of Norway lies an increase (since the beginning of the seventieths) in one of the largest natural gas branches in the world.
“However oil - the not sole reason for our prosperity”, says Anna, our waitress, who resounds trays with that sustained rakfiskom, woman with the long bright hair and surprisingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic prosperity.
We are this people - as you call - reasonable.
Like the majority of Norwegians, she wonderfully speaks in English.
We do not love to be advanced on the showing, we are not boastful.
Norway very with great care turns with its oil - the large part of the incomes of natural gas branch is invested into the special fund, created for the good of the future generations.
In the years, which preceded the world financial crisis, when all littered by the money, which did not have they, Norway thrifty calculated all expenditures.
“Thus far it is possible to be rolled on skis to in winter and walk into the marches in summer, this it is sufficient for the happiness”, says Anna.
“There is rakfisk”, it adds with the lighthearted laughter.
I cost in snow in the turn for any by food - rakfiska from me will be sufficient.
Here is hamburger with the losinym meat - this is already accurate exotic character, tasty juicy meat.
But in the evening us waits an even larger quantity all of the same fish with the unforgettable smell.
In my hotel are carried out special supper, dedicated rakfisk, in course of which the visitors determine the best or, possibly, most fragrant fish by voting.
Goes the straight television broadcasting, in which shows that leading in the necktie-butterfly, surrounded by plates rakfiskom.
This is similar to the song competition “Eurovision”.
“Thus, Thor-Jurgen, what estimation you placed for the best fish there in yourselves mountains?”
“Yes, Khavard, here is our estimation”….
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falls from the chair having, possibly, sorted out of aqua vitae.
But can, simply nadyshavshis by the smell of this fish.
The difficult beginning of career is in prospect for the President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto.
The thus far newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to enter the post, the correspondent of the BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulty, which for it is necessary to encounter, and to the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Road motion in Mexico City now in the especially lamentable state.
This city is overloaded by transport, also, in the better time, and were since Monday elevated the steel barrages, which cut several key mains to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was made not in order not to give to people to reach to the work from the suburbs, and in order to prevent participants in the protests from reaching the House of Parliament.
New the head of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will on Sunday put on the presidential crossbelt also of the signs of brazdy of administration by the country.
Complex task stands before it.
Mexico attained good economic indices with Felipe Kalderon's administration, who now adds her authorities; however, the country of pogryazla in the war with the narcotics, which in six years already took away order 60,000 lives.
“My government declares the people of Mexico about its readiness to fight with the violence”, reported earlier on this week Mr. Pena Neto to the President of the USA Barack Obama in Oval Office of the White House.
I intend to propose new strategy of safety, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements next to the President of the USA the political career of Mr. Pena Neto was developed at the post of the governor of his native state of Mexico City.
On its native land, in the densely populated and extensive state, which surrounds the capital of the country, the opinions about the new leader were divided.
Rectilinear person
In the idyllic town Vale-de-bravo, for example, about it they recall with the heat.
Inhabitants place the reanimation of tourism, development of health resort sphere and creation of infrastructure to it in the merit.
The city it is possible to reach on one of the new highway, built with G Pena Neto, which striking differ from roads with the dents and pits, which were earlier at this place.
Tables with its name hang on the contemporary building of sport center and on the impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate changes.
“We connect with it hopes for real and serious changes”, says its friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the Congressman of state from that headed Pena Neto of institution-revolutionary party (PRI).
We is expected the present and decisive changes, which are so acutely necessary for our country, first of all in the region of safety and economic development.
After 81 a continuous stay at the authority party PRI was extruded in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera recognizes that after his 12 summer absences in the presidential palace of Los-Pinos the party lays large hopes for Enrique Pena Nieto.
Furthermore, it refutes charges in the emptiness, which advanced to the new President the opposition.
It is very straight-line and it is very devoted to the matter of the embodiment of its vision of country future.
This is excellent statesman, and, first of all, person, who knows how to listen to.
But in another part of the state in many people another idea about the former governor was formed.
The municipality of Nesaualkoyotl, known also by the name Ciudad-Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the paved streets Vale-de-bravo.
Hidden under the overpasses of highways, it in many senses is the suburb of Mexico City itself.
And problems in the municipality also bear the severe nature of this megapolis.
It is earlier in this year for the suppression of gangs, which trade in narcotics in these regions, were drawn the troops; and violence in the attitude of women bears here especially sharp nature.
Several ten bodies of the killed women in last two years was only discovered on the vacant land near the extensive dump.
More than thousand women was killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Pena Neto - this considerably exceeds a similar index in the sadly become famous by violence city Ciudad-Juarez, whose name became nominal, when the discussion turns to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Pena Neto, about it at best it is possible to say that in the time of its stay at the post of governor it did not know how to manage the problem of the murder of women.
However, in the worst case they charge its administration with the complete ignoring of this problem.
The inhabitant of the concrete house, similar to the majority of houses in this decrepit region, Irineus Buendiya with difficulty holds in control tears, showing to me the photographs of its deceased daughter the Marian the Moon.
According to the official version Marian in 2010 completed suicide.
However, its family considers that its room-mate killed it.
“When I reached its house, it was it seems that its body before this they washed out”, recalls the Mrs. of Buendiya.
There were the signs of the fact that they beat up it, and body is already stiff.
Mother the Marian retells this history, and the portrait of daughter he looks on us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, on which is traced only one word: justice.
Specifically, in this, according to them, it was refused to this family.
“The officials of state turned themselves with me as with the old gossiper, dissatisfied narushitelnitsey of calmness.
They want so that the people simply would assume upon the faith everything that they speak, and they held the tongue.
But this is incorrect, so it is cannot, in particular when around so there are many disturbances and shortages”, she says.
After putting on presidential crossbelt on Saturday, President Pena Neto together with it will take upon himself difficult responsibility.
In the last six years tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected the crimes, connected with the violence, and the new President promised to make a solution of this problem to priority during his administration.
“I hope that it will be accurately the same President, such as he was governor”, says Olvera, Congressman from Vale-de-bravo from the party PRI.
However, precisely this they most of all fear the family of victims into Ciudad-Nesa.
Bradley Menning did not complain about the bad treatment, charge declares.
Accusers attempt to refute the statements of Bradley Menning about the poor conditions of the content under arrest.
In the course of hearing the increased attention was paid to a stay of Menninga in the military prison into Kvantiko, state Virginia.
Protection requires shutting the matter on the ground, that the conditions of the conclusion of Menninga were severe.
They charge the Private of the U.S. Army with the theft of several thousand secret documents.
On Friday charge attempted to prove that Private Bradley Menning, accused of the largest leakage of the classified materials in the history of the USA, did not use many opportunities to give complaint of the bad treatment, which, according to him, with it was brought to transfer, being located in the military prison.
During the cross examination at the dosudebnom hearing in the Fort-Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the state of Maryland, the judge advocate Major Eshden Feyn stated that the records of the weekly visits of Menninga by the administration officials of prison for nine months of his content into Kvantiko, state Virginia, do not contain complaints of the bad treatment.
Cross examination within the framework of the examination of the petition of protection about the curtailment of the matter of Menninga on the basis of the fact that the conditions of its conclusion were severe and they were by themselves a sufficient punishment, it was carried out next day after Menning he stated that being located under arrest, it intended to commit suicide.
Military specialist in the analysis of intelligence information, arrested in June 2010, is charged with the theft of several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published in the Internet on the site of WikiLeaks.
The resource of WikiLeaks did not confirm that information source was precise Menning.
During the hearing on Friday attorney Feyn together with Menningom examined the reports, which were filled up after the visits of Menninga by administration officials during his stay in the prison Kvantiko, where it was located on the conditions of a strict regime of conclusion from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits the employees of prison assigned Menningu questions and its answers were written.
When attorney Feyn asked on Friday about the reports, Menning recognized that is evaluated the turning to itself from the side of the administration of prison as “excellent”, and the general conditions of conclusion as “is very professionally organized”.
The reports examined do not contain complaints of the bad treatment, in spite of the fact that Menninga directly asked about the conditions of its content, asserts Feyn.
Menning answered, that it expressed oral apprehension by these problems and, that its attended administration officials discussed with it these problems and declared, that by them they will study, but they did not fix this in the written form.
“They wrote “problems they are absent” (after the consideration of my complaints), but this does not mean that I did not raise this theme in the conversation”, says Menning.
Military judge, Colonel Deniz Linda, also asked Menninga, why that did not complain about the incorrect rotation with it in January 2011 during the session of the commission, which examined the suicidal intentions, which it expressed in the written form for several months to that.
Menning answered, that he wanted to attain during that session so that from it they would remove the regime “of warning of traumatism” and would soften the conditions of conclusion.
The representatives of military management explained, what limited regime of conclusion - to the level is lower than the regime of supervision for the purpose of averting suicide - it was introduced for the protection of prisoner, and also for the safety of others.
“I wanted to give to know administrations that with me all in the order, so that they would cancel the regime of warning traumatism… so that the level of my life it would be improved, from my point of view”, explained Menning.
On Thursday Menning testified about its arrest in Iraq and transfer in Kuwait, where him they contained almost two months they before transferred into the prison on the Naval base into Kvantiko, state of Virginia, in July 2010.
It reported that the thoughts about the suicide appeared in its Kuwait, and that once it lost consciousness because of the strong heat.
It explained, which is psychologically very heavy, when to you they do not give to know, as your lot is solved, and which occurs in the external world.
“My peace was pressed to the base camp-Arifzhan, to the dimensions of my prison, said Menning on Thursday.
- I thought that I will die in this cell”.
Being located into Kvantiko, Menning, according to him, carried out the large part of the time in the small camera - at least 21 hour, and often even it is more than 23 hours in a 24 hour period - in the complete solitude.
Menning reports that it they permitted to leave only mattress, blanket, shlepantsy, several objects of clothing and glasses.
He indicates that he tried to move, since to sleep or even simply to lie in the day time forbade rules.
According to Menninga, during the sleep the eyes to it constantly struck the light, which penetrates outside the camera.
If guards did not see its face, when it was turned over in the bed at night, then, according to him, it they woke and made it necessary to overturn to the back.
Attorney Menninga gave the official objection apropos of incorrect rotation with Menningom in January 2011.
In April 2011 Menninga transferred into the military prison into the fort-Livenvort, state of Kansas.
Furthermore, on Friday judge questioned Menninga about the statement, which it made during the dacha of indications on Thursday, about the fact that after they they once at night forced to sleep by that exposed in its camera into Kvantiko, it they forced to stand by naked before the guards and others prisoners on the morning checking.
Menning stated that it did not have the opportunity to cover by blanket during the checking.
Answering questions of judge on Friday, Menning said that he understood from the order of guard that must throw the blanket, by which it could be covered, but it recognized that no one directly ordered it to throw it.
On Thursday Menning stated that it they the previous night forced to sleep by naked because of its attempt to show officer that it does not present danger for itself.
Menning reported that it said to officer that it could use elastic of cowards or shlepantsy in order to traumatize itself, but it did not make this.
By that night, according to the evidence of Menninga, its underwear, shlepantsy and glasses took away from the camera.
Its attorneys hope that the judge, at least, will consider that the fact that for it was necessary to survive during the conclusion, and substantially will reduce the period of conclusion, if Menning will be acknowledged by the guilty military court, which must begin the examination of its matter at the beginning of the following year.
Protection she stated that it plans to propose Menningu to recognize fault for the less serious crimes, and other charges to dispute as excessive.
The renewal of hearings is planned to these output, it is expected that the side of charge will insist on what content conditions were under arrest justified.
The Pentagon asserts that Menning was contained into Kvantiko in accordance with the rules, which regulate the content of prisoners with a maximally strict regime.
Among the charges, advanced to Menningu, are complicity to enemy, the illegal assistance to promulgation of data in the Internet, the transmission of the information, which is concerned national defense, and theft of the government ownership or documents.
If it will be condemned on all points indictment, the life imprisonment can threaten to it.
My crisis of national self-determination - story of the American of Mexican origin.
In the opinion of the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the absence of the opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those, who left, because they remind the inhabitants of the country about the complex times.
Ruben Navarette considers that the Mexicans of American origin are torn up between two cultures.
I passed along the corridor for those arriving, approached the zone of border control and am chilled on the spot during the recent trip to Mexico City.
Signs indicated two turns: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I several seconds stood before them, without knowing, where to go.
I grew in central California, and me entire life was called Mexican.
This simply code name, similarly, as my friends in Boston are called themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped at the complex construction “American of Mexican origin”.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, on the native land of my grandfather, there was no need in the code names or complex constructions.
I was simple American.
I speak in Spanish sufficiently well in order to pose questions or to answer on them.
But my lexical reserve is poorer than in the carriers of language, and I cannot get rid of the American accent.
Therefore I reached my American passport and he became in the turn for Extranjeros.
I recalled this history several days ago, when the newly selected President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda they stood questions customary for the encounters of the Presidents of these countries: immigration, narcotics and trade.
President Pena Neto willingly spoke about the upsurge of the Mexican economy, therefore the Mexicans now, equally well, can remain in Mexico, instead of move into the United States.
He wants to conclude the agreement about the partnership with the USA and Canada and to create certain North American commercial block like the European Union.
Furthermore, President Pena Neto promised to continue war against the narkokarteley in Mexico; however, no specific proposals it sounded.
For Mexico relation with the United States - heavy and completed old offences question.
The majorities of Americans never thought about the fact that the in 1848 United States it invaded Mexico and under the muzzle of rifles they forced its leaders to forego half of their territory.
But Mexicans think by centuries, but not by minutes, and reminders about those events in everything see.
Therefore it is worth to only any statesman of the USA mention although by the word of criticism to the side of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society here are heard complaint about the fact that the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesumy fill by militancy.
In this case most complex appear the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin, that live in the USA.
You do want to have a talk about the offences?
It is sufficient them.
In Mexico are winners and lost, the people, which find in this country for themselves of opportunity, and those, there are no such opportunities for whom.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so there are many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: at some moment of their family history someone - father or grandfather - did not have an opportunity to realize itself in Mexico and it was forced to leave for the north.
Most frequently these were Mexicans of the specific type - dark-comlexioned, poorly educated, from the poor peasant families.
We their descendants, and we remember about this.
In Mexico this they see otherwise.
Today our life - this embodiment of American dream, we learned in good schools and were arranged to good works, but to us not to forget that even this dream - American, and not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is tangled and it is unclear, but we know, what country to consider its.
The United States of America.
We know moreover that the majority of the representatives of Mexican elite and ruling class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us reminding about the humiliating defeats and relate to us as to the people of the second type as to the false Mexicans.
We insufficiently speak well in Spanish, and our connections with Mexico are insufficiently strong.
Our existence itself for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors would succeed in Mexico, they did not leave.
We would not prove to be now after the silk curtain, after finding in the USA satisfied life, but after losing spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the USA even in the childhood, and this reminds me about the fact that between the real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there are specific frictions - Mexicans more clearly understand their national identity, and to the Americans of Mexican origin this is offensive.
It the citizen of the USA considers that it belongs to both countries.
At the same time many my familiar Americans of Mexican origin feel belonging not with one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstina.
Obtaining best of two peace, you unavoidably lose roots.
In Mexico we are Americans.
But in the USA they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I explained during my trip, as if our relations without that are insufficiently tangled, some Mexican leaders and representatives of intelligentsia want to restore relations with the diaspore.
They want so that the Americans of Mexican origin would work their kind as the ambassadors of Mexico and would be of its interests to the USA.
We could describe to our friend-Americans about which this excellent country and as is healthy her to attend, and could convince political leaders to strengthen connections with Mexico.
Aha, certainly.
Nothing it will leave.
There are too many offences in the past.
But taking into account the break between the rich and poor, the revelry of corruption and narcotics trafficking, many of us do not completely consider this country of such already excellent.
You will excuse, but be investigated with this themselves, amigos.
And this is correct.
If the part of the Mexicans, until now, cannot forgive to the United States first, as they entered with Mexico one-and-a-half century ago, to them it is necessary to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin still in the offence for that, as very recently in Mexico they managed with their relatives.
Yes already.
Perhaps, it is more general, than me it seemed.
Old battles in the new Near East
Cease-fire agreement between Israel and group Hamas can become brittle foundation for further peace
Is possible lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Near East?
The sequential round of bloodshed pushes slightly to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
Sound, the become with customary, senseless disputes about that, who the first of beginnings; many buildings they are converted into the ruins; are killed more than 140 Palestinians, majority of whom composed citizens, and six Israelis; for the first time in the time of conflict, released from the territory throttle controls rockets fell in the environments of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and Holy City of Jerusalem.
However, in spite of the fact that Israelis and Palestinians is hopeless of uvyazli in its age long conflict, in the Near East arrived the changes.
It is possible to relate differently to this; however, the events “Arab spring” turned in rebellious borax many kept balance realia, and for Palestinians with Israelis could not be remain beside the vortex, which shook region.
Possibly, as a result, their fight will become even bloodier than earlier.
However, there are reasons, which give hope for output from this fatal impasse.
War without the winners
The at first glance prevailing situation does not give occasions for the optimism.
Even if cease fire, agreement about which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, collisions occurred on this week only strengthened the positions of power figures from both sides.
Leaders of Islamic movement Hamas, that arrived at the authority in the Gaza Strip in 2007; will state from that they forced Israel to step back, in spite of the carried by them losses.
In spite of the fact that some leaders of group were destroyed, and 1.7 million inhabitants were blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel did not succeed in destroying Hamas.
In reality Hamas increases its popularity on the West Bank of river Jordan - one additional Palestinian territory, controlled at present by the more moderate motion FATEH.
Moreover, leaders Hamas completely can come to the conclusion that the time works on them.
In proportion to an increase in the influence of Islamic motions in the Arab world in Hamas appear new influential and rich friends.
The reviving himself regional leader Turkey, which was once the nearest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, came out with the support Hamas; its example followed Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.
The triumphant supporters Hamas declare about the creation around Israel of Islamic demilune - from Lebanon on the north, in which guides the militarized group the Hezbollah, to Syria, in which ever more proislamistskie rebels is any minute now thrown down authority Bashar Assada, and further to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten Royal power.
A significant change of the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where during President Mukhammede Mursi's lifetime was strengthened the influence of motion the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who guided by Egypt for 30 years and it was thrown down in 2011; was secular dictator, who did not pay special attention to support Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood are, on the contrary, the organization, in many respects similar Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In the future diplomatic arrangements Hamas can become the significant player, whose voice will not succeed in muffling even Israel and America.
At the same time the supporters “rigid” line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense Hamas was devastated.
Israeli antimissile system “iron cupola” justified expenditures for its creation and successfully destroyed many of that neglected Hamas rockets.
The citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least some time.
Concerning diplomacy, the USA they remained accurate to their constant position; many European Countries also laid fault for the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
One additional important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, in particular with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who to a considerable degree ignored peaceful process.
In spite of the fact that since 2004. approximately 30 Israelis died from the rockets, released from the territory of throttle control, Israel succeeded in reducing to a minimum the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which goes to the territory of the West Bank of river Jordan - the substantial part of the unacknowledged Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to be enlarged in spite of the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international legislation.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party the Likud - within the framework of the preparation for the outlined on January 22 selections - was combined with even the more aggressive disposed conservatives under the government of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What sense to show indulgence to Palestinians and to give to them her own state?
If we return into their hands entire authority in the territory of West Bank, will not begin they to start from there rockets to the side of Israel, as do make their fellows in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to hold them after the wall and it is rigid to suppress any attempts to raise heads.
Possibly, the supporters “rigid” line will gain victory; however, their calculations can be disproved by Arab spring.
With the fact that the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, experience the not warmest feelings to Israel, internal problems will become their priority task.
The defense part of the budget of Israel is greater than in all its Arab neighbors, together.
Unleashing war with the regional super-power will hardly help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked at cease fire, is a good sign and can mark with itself the beginning of changes.
Israel, to not smaller degree, must consider the lasting effects of its policy.
In proportion to the offensive of democratic changes in the Arab countries, the deprivation of the Palestinians of right in the self-determination is the time bomb, which will sooner or later explode on those occupied by Israel territories, similar to the bus, exploded in Tel Aviv on this week.
Repression already undermine the bases of democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect (increase in the Arab population )only aggravates these problems.
For the bloody operations, which are conducted each several years in the territory of throttle control for the suppression of motion Hamas, it is necessary to pay by the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need the external impulse
Remains the unique solution, to which neustanno call the sober-minded representatives from both sides, and also large part of remaining peace and our newspaper: the formation of two states and concession by Israel territories in exchange for the safety.
The hope, not too impressive over the short term long term, remains, hope for the fact that the cease fire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the sides of conflict.
Egypt, to which it is time to make the decision to overlap the deliveries of weapon into the throttle control, and also Turkey and Qatar have available never as, advantageous position in order to convince Hamas to recognize the boundaries of Jewish state, accepted since 1967 taking into account of exchange of territories and joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries also must exert efforts to the reconciliation of motions Hamas and FATEH.
This would make more for creating the Palestinian state, than the forthcoming voting in the United Nations, result of which can become the acknowledgement of virtual statehood of Palestine.
His role in, seating of Israel for the negotiating table, must play President Obama.
During its first period it so did not represent its own plan of peaceful settlement.
After the return to the White House it as before demonstrates the unwillingness to be connected to the solution of this problem.
This is catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States are vitally interested in the stability in the Near East.
This is possible only in the case of the peace accord between Israel and Palestinians.
Australia entered the force the law about the standardized packing for cigarette.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and image of the struck by diseases body parts contrastingly are separated on the sad green boxes, identical for all stamps cigarette.
_first in world practice Australian law about uniform packing cigarette also tobacco article come into force v silu, substitute logotype and colored formulation different stamp identical box sad-olive color with terrible photograph struck disease body part tela and image child, health which blow up smoking their parent.
Besides the different pictures and inscriptions, which warn about the harm of smoking, the only difference between the bundles, introduced in the required order from this Saturday - the name stamps, which are printed by identical small type.
These are the most severe in the world conditions for the formulation of the packings of tobacco articles.
The Federal Government of Australia declares, that the purpose of this measure - to hold young people from smoking, depriving this addiction of fashionable status.
The results of the studies, which showed, lay as the basis of this solution that people, which did not begin to smoke of up to 26 years, in 99 cases of 100 so never and become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the youngest age the children understand the sense, which they attempt to report tobacco companies with the aid of the formulation of packing”, explains the minister of public health Tanya Plibersek, referring to the studies, which showed that, for example, the crown in the logotype is associated in children with the idea of princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the smallest in the world portion of smokers, so that these changes especially will not affect the profits of transnational corporations; however, the opportunity of adopting the such measures already examine other countries.
The representatives of tobacco industry intensely counteracted the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies assert that this will only increase the portion of the Black Market, on which will be sold cheap and accessible cigarettes.
“This law will lead to the serious consequences, different from those, which thought by its initiators”, counts Scott Makintayr, the representative of the company of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The producers of false production of China and Indonesia will supply much more than such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to an increase in the business.
Sandra ha from the small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd asserts that the demand for the cigarette cases and silicone cases, which hide unpleasant pictures on the packing, swiftly grew (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip of Morris and Japan Tobacco they lost the matter in the high court of Australia, where they attempted to appeal this law.
According to the Sandra ha, the company of Zico already realized the order of six thousand articles to the enterprises of wholesale trade and it expects new party.
This is a good business for us.
Potential interference for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely that part of the population, toward which are directed these measures.
After the adoption in Australia of a number of the laws, which made illegal television advertisement cigarette and the support by them of sport measures, and forbidding to salesmen to also advance cigarettes in sight place, the advertisement of tobacco articles moved into the Internet.
The government of Australia forbade to domestic firms and Web sites to place advertisement in the network, but it cannot limit foreign sites in this.
“If you deal in tobacco articles and in you only this small hole remained, the idea to move their goods in the Internet will seem you by extremely tempting”, explains Beki Freeman, that investigates questions of public health at the university of sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of the trade marks, written from the person allegedly of usual users, in such social networks as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Does arise question - is actual whether this affair of the hands of the series citizen, who does so love the cigarettes of Marlboro that it was not sorry forces and time and did make a videotape, or after this does stand advertising company?
The Australian department of the company of British American Tobacco asserts that in the branch it is now more greatly occupied with adaptation to the new rules, than by advertisement.
The representatives of tobacco industry send even to such measures as the sponsoring of Ukraine, honduras and of Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states present claim within the framework of the World Trade Organization, declaring about the fact that the trade underwent by wrong limitations, in spite of the fact that the commercial relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
The resolution of the WTO (World Trade Organization) is expected to the middle of 2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the opportunity of adopting by them the similar laws about the packing.
In 2001 Canada of the first introduced the required arrangement of the photographs, which warn about the harm of smoking.
Now this rule is accepted in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The opportunity of the stiffening of laws is examined in Great Britain, New Zealand, Republic of South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia they do not demonstratively obey to innovations.
These pictures do not catch me.
I simply do not turn attention.
“Simply you snatch out to cigarette and hide bundle into the pocket”, explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with the photograph of the tumor of oral cavity on the bundle.
Honestly speaking, only, what can force me to throw - this is my small daughter.
James Yu, who manages by the store of the tobacco articles of King of the Pack in the center of sydney, asserts that the identical packing complicated the task of the arrangement of goods on the regiments
“Earlier in me for unloading of new party departed hour, and now four hours”, it complains.
“Government it was necessary to take and to entirely forbid cigarettes, we then said: however, which to make, is agreeable, everything is ended, we shut store”, he says, throwing up hands upward.
To be bored in the world electronic networks and constant connections - this is not so already and it is bad.
During this day of gratitude for me unexpectedly it was necessary to conduct five hours in the airport, because mechanical troubles were revealed in our aircraft and they replaced it with another aircraft, which we waited until.
Thus, i had sufficient time for the reflections about nature of boredom.
I will not deceive you.
Noon in the airport in the expectation of voyage - this is actually boring, and here strongly will not help neither books nor periodicals nor iPhone nor even stores of duty-free trade.
However, recently increasingly more scientists and specialists for the children's development speak out in favor boredoms.
They indicate that in the specific situations for us and for our children to be bored not too and it is bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted on the interesting adjacent themes, which, possibly, contributes to creation.
But since in modern world we all constantly are situated before any screen, the advantages of boredom are passed by us.
It can be we should approach boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time no.
We still will return to this.
Is earlier I, as many, she considered that boredom - invention relative to the recent times, when in people more than free time appeared.
This is not so, asserts Peter Tui, the professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian university of Calgary, the author of the book “captivating history of boredom” (Boredom: A of Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
“In reality boredom can brag of very ancient history”, he says.
The Latin inscriptions about the boredom, dated by the first century, are discovered on the walls in the Pompeys.
In this case remains open a question about how we understand boredom.
Problem in that, speaks John d. Eastwood, the associate professor of university York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom frequently changed.
After studying the materials of experiments on this theme and after presenting the question to task force into 100 people, professor Eastwood and his colleagues arrived at the following definition: boredom - this when people “want, but they cannot be occupied by the fact that would bring to them the satisfaction”.
The difference between the boredom and apathy, he speaks, it consists in the fact that the being bored person does not make something, that he would want to make.
Nothing to make it is desirable with the apathy.
Basic in the survived boredom, he speaks, this “disturbance of attention and connected with this worsening in the mood and the sensation of the fact that the time is pulled slowly”.
According to the description the boredom can seem by very similar to depression.
However, professor Eastwood asserts that in spite of the possible connection between these states, the being bored people see the reasons for problems in surrounding peace and circumstances, and people, which survive depression, see problems in themselves.
It sometimes us seems that to us it is boring, when in reality to us it is simply difficult on by something to be concentrated.
In its study “the unoccupied reason: the determination of boredom from the point of view of attention”, published in September release of the periodical of Perspectives on of Psychological Science, professor Eastwood with the colleagues refer to the carried out earlier experiment, whose participants listened to the record of the voice, which reads periodical.
Some participants heard also the loud sounds of the not relating to the matter tv program, switched on in the adjacent room, others heard the same sounds on the low of loudness, so that hardly it was possible to dismantle them, but the third group listened to only the record of voice without the outside sound track.
Those participants, who heard television with the low level of loudness, they noted that it was boring, more frequent than others - it was difficult to be concentrated, but they did not know the reason for this and assigned this to boredom.
When we attempt to concentrate attention in the difficult or captivating task, the interruption of attention can cause boredom, speaks Mark J. of Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the university of Gvelfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of this investigation.
From the other side, when we make anything uninteresting, “for example, scrutinizing into the flow of articles on the conveyor in the search for marriage, the distracting music can help to avoid boredom”.
It is considered, it continues, that when people begin to rock on the chair or to sketch astrakmans on the sheet of paper, they make this from the boredom; however, now we know that in reality such actions simply help not to weaken physically.
“A study showed that the children, to which they do not forbid to fidget and to be twirled, learn better and memorize more information, than the children, whom they require to sit quietly”, asserts professor Fenske.
At some moments we all experience the boredom: with the delay of voyage (as in my case), listening to monotonic speech, examining uninteresting film.
However, different people demonstrate the different degree of tendency toward the boredom.
In the 1980's years for measuring such specific features the researchers developed the special “scale of tendency toward the boredom”.
For determining the estimation according to this scale are used questions and assertions, for example, “much of the fact that for me is necessary to make, monotonous and monotonically” or “to me too much is interesting; therefore not to that time is sufficient”.
The researchers determined with the aid of such questionnaires, that the boys are bored more frequent than girls, says Steven Vodanovich, the professor of psychology at the university of West Florida, in particular with the presence of diverse external stimuli.
However, as a whole adolescents generally frequently are bored.
In 1991. Reed Larson, the professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted the experiment, in course of which he was connected with the aid of the pager almost with 400 adolescents and their parents of 7-8 times in the day.
It obtained the following results: 32% of adolescents stated, that by them is boring in the school and during the fulfillment of domestic target, and 23% stated, that by them is boring beyond the limits of school.
In this case only 3% of parents noted that by them it is boring.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have data about which would be similar data about the boredom now, 21 year later.
However, he knows that “to the teenage period is fallen the peak of tendency toward the boredom”, in essence because to children and for adolescents they do not make possible entirely to decide how it to study.
Let us return to my initial question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes no, because in the extreme manifestations it, as show studies, can push slightly people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky games of chance or abuse of the specific substances in the attempts to get rid of the boredom.
From the other side, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between the boredom and creation, speaks professor Vodanovich, who dedicated to the study of this problem of more than two decades.
“So our brain prompts to us that it follows to study something other; this is boredom”, tell in Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the New York university.
However, this brain itself does not always know how precisely it is better to study.
If to you it will be boring and you will direct this energy toward the game on the guitar or culinary experiences, you will make to yourselves better.
However, if you will begin to watch TV, they will become better only to some period, and soon this it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give to it iPad, it will cease to be bored; however, it will not learn to fight with the boredom independently or by somehow other method to govern its time and employment, says professor Fenske.
“A such habits of independent regulation are engaged in the most different situations”, it asserts.
Your child learns not only to independently occupy himself something, he also learns self-control generally.
I do not think that the boredom must be somehow extolled.
However, to consider it its something poor also does not stand.
Rather one should learn to feel itself comfortably even out of the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Eastwood is agreeable with this.
“We see this so that we should more frequently experience boredom, with the fact that boredom - this extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to study something that comprehended”, he, says.
In reality people attempt somehow to be turned off from constant concerns and it is simple to be weakened.
“In modern world we became accustomed to a constant excessive stimulation of sensory organs, he says, and when it begins silence, we are lost even we do not know what to make”.
Is thus far incomprehensibly as will be used new law about the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
By Anthony Orosko, the nineteenth-year player of football team and student of community college on the southeast of the state of Colorado is accused of the accomplishment of the criminal offense, which is consisted in the fact that will be soon completely lawful in the entire territory of the state: storage of the small portion of marijuana and tube, in which it smoked.
Mr. Orosko says that once in September he with the friends was in Lamare and he went in the automobile on the prairie near the boundary with Kansas, when policemen stopped them.
After policeman it revealed in the machine marijuana, to Mr. Orosko arrived agenda into the court for the storage of narcotics and ownership of adaptation for the use of the narcotics - small offenses, for each of which is due penalty in the size of 100 dollars - and is assigned the date of judicial session.
“With us they turn as with the criminals”, says Mr. Orosko.
But criminal whether it?
As a result of the uncertainty, which continues already several weeks after the state of Colorado it voted for the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for the entertainment, solution of hundreds of small judicial matters depends not so much on law, as from the place of examination.
Charges in the small offenses, connected with marijuana, has already been removed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which took similar measure.
Police stations already ended to advance charges to people at age 21 of year and it is older for the storage of small doses, which will begin to be considered legal, as soon as through the pair of weeks law will come into force.
However, in the more conservative regions of Colorado accusers made the decision to examine the existing matters, connected with marijuana, and on the previous they assign on the responsibility for storage of this narcotic.
At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain regions of the West they vote for that in order not to allow appearance in their places of the new, licensed by state stores on sale of marijuana.
“All this is developed so swiftly, that I even do not know, what to wait further”, say Daniel J. of Outs, chief of the police in the town aurora to the east of from Denver.
The representatives of controlling bodies in Washington State also puzzled scratch heads.
For them one must form rules for determining the order of the licensing of cultivation, working, propagation and sale of marijuana, and all this must be made until December 1, 2013.
They indicate that Colorado, good this or is bad, anticipates the majority of other states in regulating of questions of the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for the entertainment.
“In Colorado the more regulated market; therefore they will serve as good example”, explain Brian I. Smith, representative of council for the regulation of production and sale of alcoholic production in Washington State.
But now no one can make more, recognizes Mr. Smith how to advance some propositions and to hope that this he will operate.
“We do not have present precedent, to which we could be oriented”, he says.
The bill of Washington State, named is i-th-502, it will come into force on December 6 and for entire year will plunge state into the state of the uncertainty, when there are no systems of state licensing still, and the right of the ownership of marijuana is already legalized.
But there are indeed even more complex technical aspects, which it is necessary to decide during this period, for example, how to find the equilibrium between the order of state about “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with the prohibition to the trade in it at a distance of 1000 feet from the schools, parks, playing fields and kindergartens.
“It is especially complicated it will be complicated to locate the licensed enterprises for trade in marijuana within the boundaries of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs”, explain Ben Livingston, representative of the recently created research group “the center of the legalization of marijuana”.
On November 21 the chief of the police of Outs from the aurora sent out to his subordinate on the electronic mail communication, that the prosecutor's office of city more will not assign those, who reached age 21 year, on the responsibility for the ownership of a small quantity of marijuana, and that the police ceases to seize people in the given disturbances “from this time on”.
The chief of the police of Outs reported that the police will follow the observance in the city of the rules, which regulate the activity of those, who rear marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal merchants and spreaders of narcotics.
The attorney of Ueld region on the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a stricter approach to this question.
After voting on the bill he stated that the prosecutor's office will as before assign on the responsibility for the ownership of marijuana, mainly in order to impel its using persons to pass the course of treatment.
At the given moment for 119 persons are produced the charges in storage of two and less than the ounces of marijuana, although many of them are charged also with other disturbances.
“The responsibility of our establishment - to pursue for the actions, which are considered criminal at the moment of their accomplishment”, said Mr. Bak in his statement.
Reaction was ambiguous even in such places as the rural region of Mesa, where participants in the voting rejected proposal about the legalization of marijuana.
The police the grandee of Junction, largest city in the region, no longer assigns on the responsibility of adult for the ownership of a small quantity of narcotic.
District attorney Pit Khauttsinger supported this solution, but also he decided not to remove charges in the already open matters, connected with the storage of marijuana.
“I consider what to ensure the observance of law until it changes - our straight responsibility”, he says.
In spite of the fact that 55% of inhabitants of the state of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported this solution, the start of questions of the use of marijuana for the entertainments into the state and legal system will not be simple.
But the contradictory reaction of inhabitants in the different places of state bared the ambiguity of the ratio of local authorities to the experiment of state with marijuana.
“In district attorneys in this question there is a cultural barrier”, explains Sean Makalister, denverskiy attorney, who is of interests of those condemned for the storage of marijuana, and local representative of the national organization of the reformation of laws on marijuana.
“They so for long pursued people for this, that now they cannot properly be subdued with the fact that this no longer crime”, he says.
Colorado and to Washington - to first states, in which to a small quantity of marijuana they relate, just as to alcohol - it is judged to become experimental field on scales of the country for checking the very idea of the legalization of narcotics.
The supporters of legalization and officials of state plan to enlarge the territory of the legalizovannoy trade, but at the same time they cautiously wait indications from federal of the authorities, which as before plan to consider sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The supporters of the legalization of marijuana hope that the administration of justice will yield in this question.
In spite of several received wide resonance arrests of merchants and patients, who used marijuana from the medical indications, the Federal Government in the majority of the cases gave good in trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The agents of bureaus for fight with the narcotics will be hardly dug in into the houses in order to confiscate the small small packet of marijuana; however, they hardly they will begin to shut eyes to the adjusted by state government stores of recreational marijuana, which are permitted according to the new law, counts Kevin A. Sabet, the former adviser on questions of fight with the narcotics in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not begin to wait until the actions of federal authorities.
Even to the presidential elections some local administrations approved moratorium for the discovery of new stores on sale of marijuana, which so could not be opened earlier than in year.
Last week Montrouz, city in the Western part of the state, advanced for the examination the six months old prohibition in trade in marijuana, which, in all likelihood, will be approved on the following week.
“We do not want to prove to be in such position that we will give out license to someone, but then this will cause serious problems at the federal level”, say Bob Nickolson, member of town council.
Our city voted against this correction.
And contradiction between the results of local voting and fact is now present, for which the state voted.
Still many unresolved questions remain.
Petronella Uayett: me they survived from Oxford for the fact that I am conservative.
The pursuits of university students for their views began not today.
How much I itself remember, I always dreamed to enter into the oxford university.
My father and big brother learned in Oxford and was described him as better in the world educational institution, the contemporary analog of antique symposium, which lays two bases of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And nevertheless, after two weeks of studies in the historical department of the Vusterskogo college of oxford university at the end of the eightieths, I gathered trunks and left, which took the shape of a first present scandal in my life.
My father did not maintain and began to cry.
Friends were biased to sense.
The newspaper of The Evening Standard asserted that I threw college, because it was not pleased to me, that my classmates deal with sex in the adjacent room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked, that I left, because for me it was necessary to drink out of the pock-marked cups.
In reality everything was not so amusingly.
I ran out.
Yes, it ran out, because they systematically hunted and intimidated me.
Entirely not because of my sufficiently uncommon name or the fact that I learned in the private school.
Me was hunted only for one reason, and in this renowned cradle of culture this appeared by present barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Vudro Uayett, was the well-known adviser of Margaret Thatcher, and I itself was the supporter of conservatives.
But you will ask, why to recall about this now?
According to last data, the new generation of students, which is adhered to right-centrist views, undergoes the same hunting.
This institutsionalizirovannaya and constantly growing hatred for the student-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week the group of such students required the same protection of its rights as that, which is allowed to invalids, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the student club of college the group of Christy in Cambridge declare, that them “they frequently actively insulate, they subject to personal attacks and they force to feel themselves by the nezhelannymi guests” because of their political views.
They want to introduce into the committee on the equal rights of the college of additional representative in order to ensure freedom of expression of its opinion.
Their situation only aggravated left recently on BBC 2 documentary film about the policy among students “the country of the miracles: young, clever and right”, in which conservatives they represented by cams and neo-Nazis.
In the film were shown Joe Cook, former President of the association of the conservatives of the oxford university, which drives in the Rolls-Royce, bears silver suit and cane with the silver knob.
At other universities the student-conservatives complain, that of them make “the scapegoats because of an increase in the pay for the studies”.
Hatchway Black, 20 years, the Vice President of the association of the conservatives of the Nottingemskogo university, in an interview for one of the Sunday newspapers said that “in the university medium increases the misalignment to the side of left views.
People, which us even do not know, previously consider us the insolent and with impunity violent children of rich parents”.
Semyuel Roberts, 21 year, the student of the historical department of college the group of Christy, in which was given the application about strengthening of protection, calls this atmosphere “of cheerless”, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new President of the association of the conservatives of oxford university, he indicates that the ratio of members of student club to the carriers of right-centrist views considerably deteriorated.
“This is threat both for the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and it is simple for the normal life of members of club”, she, says.
The first several weeks in Oxford I was not simple in the minority, I was one.
I entered there in September 1986, by a timid and shy eighteen-year old girl.
Oxford it ran a fever from the hatred for the Conservative Party.
In the year to this university by voting it deprived the former student of Margaret Thatcher of her honorable degree because of the reduction of the budget allocations for higher education.
In this atmosphere it would be uncomfortably even stalinistam.
During the first days of the week of the freshman, when students become acquainted with each other and with the instructors, I for the first time perceived that it waited me in front.
I yet did not know that the instructors not only looked through the fingers at the hunting of student-conservatives, but also themselves with the pleasure participated in it.
Political questions - strike of miners, privatization and the disagreement of government to use sanctions against the government of apartheid in Republic of South Africa - penetrated through the sheathed by wooden panels walls of audiences.
At my first seminar for I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century in the English, and I was not ready for the fact that followed this.
“Miss Uayett, said instructor, now deceased Harry Pitt, if you please, transfer the first paragraph”.
Text was given to me with difficulty, I hesitated.
Harry Pitt was very bilious person with face, similar to the cake.
“Tetcheristy principally they do not teach French or to them simply the brains are not sufficient?” - it asked.
Other students of zakhikhikali.
In me on the eyes the tears came out.
“I advise you to take several initial lessons of French in the free time, if you, of course, are not very occupied, revolving in the society”, probryuzzhal Pitt.
I returned to my room of completely unhappy.
In that evening in the college I sat at dinner one; then someone slapped me on the arm.
This were James, student of the second course from the department of English, which was represented as the member of the association of the conservatives of university.
“I know who you, he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, matter is as follows:
above each, whom they suspect of the sympathy to the conservatives, they will jeer.
To me very it is not easy, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore to you it will be more complexly.
The majorities of freshman-conservatives are shut, that they are laborists”.
It is later, in the local pub, I in a cowardly manner attempted to play the hypocrite.
I insisted on what it was agreeable not with all, which tells in Margaret Thatcher.
Craftiness did not succeed.
The freshman of the department of philosophy, policy and economy, which itself learned in Eaton, he said: “You is the daughter of Fascist pig.
You infectious”.
Other students caught its words.
I was damaged, dirty.
“As conservatives they are occupied by sex? - Asked one of them.
- They strike each other, truth?”
I felt itself in the manner that homosexuals to the cancellation of criminal prosecution in the Sixties probably felt themselves.
Can I sometimes live normal life in Oxford?
But or for me it is necessary to be met with the adherents only under cover of night?
Will I forced become leyboristkoy and to hide my present persuasions?
Forthcoming i three years began to seem by hell, complete of persecutions and solitude.
Only instructor in my college, who did not hide his conservative convictions, were Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
It they hated not only for the belonging with the conservatives, but also for the fact that it was the adviser of Thatcher on questions of foreign policy and one of its spichrayterov.
In the college it practically did not appear.
It despised it for the provinciality, meanness and adherence to Marxist-deterministic view on the history.
In 1997 it accepted professorial post at the university of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“Here you will not be happy”, he said to me.
I began to drive into Oxford from parental house to London, trying to find refuge among the relatives and unprejudiced capital friends.
I said to father that I hate Oxford it explained reason.
It did not believe me.
Any political views there started during its studies in the fortieth years.
“But indeed the same the best university in the world, he said sorrowfully.
- It is not there to similar capable, only not in the city of the dremlyushchikh spires…
Even my friend-Communists always behaved flawlessly”.
Its moist eyes turned turbid.
“Do not assume the hasty solutions.
I am confident, that this is simple of joke.
You will break to me heart, if you throw university”.
I was iznurena constants to the trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also conservative, did not maintain pressure and he forewent its persuasions.
On the following week during the seminar, when the sequential instructor of history completely seriously named me “the enemy of people”, I decided to enter so.
In the soul burning from the shame, I acknowledged that “to me washed the brains the parents”, and were named they “old fools”.
Respite was brief.
Last nail into the cover of the coffin of my career in Oxford it was judged drive in to my father.
At that time he wrote each week on two columns for the publications, which belong to Rupert Murdock.
My door was closed.
I did not leave, and my persecutors were returned after five minutes.
When they left, whereas I gathered trunk and villages to the first train to London.
I so did not return.
Can call me cry-baby and rag.
But into eighteen years no one must become the object of this malice and intimidations in the educational institution.
Those sadder, that this was Oxford, which not only let out fourteen Prime Ministers of Tory, but also to this day it is hidden behind the undeserved reputation of the university, at which they value equality and freethinking.
“Valentina prefers elegance to glory”
On the exhibition “Valentina: the master of sewing”, which was opened on this week in London, ABC converses with the ITR of Abaskal, Fionoy Thyssen-Bornemitsa et al by the well-known clients of the Italian designer

Designer recognized this during the discovery “as Valentina: the master of sewing”, triumphal retrospective exhibition, which unites more than 130 it is clothing high mode, created with its “house” during the last 50 years.
I " adore this palace”, he speaks with its unique Italian emphasis.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the history, whose only character - “il to signora” Garavani; however, it could not be written without its distinguished clients.
Valentina always felt itself by charmed rare and distant peace to znati.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened until March 3, abound personal letters and photographs over the signature of the most notable aristocrats, from princess Salimy the Aha-khan to lord Snoudon, including Marie-Shantal, the princess of Greece, and Margaret, the princess of Great Britain.
Valentina shows these personal memories as the trophies of her social lifting: from the modest tailor from Vogera city on the north of Italy to the idol of international “elite”.
To be the enamored one with the royal court - in this there is nothing poor.
“They at least do not dissipate the cigarette-butts of their cigarette against your splendid carpet, as this make some excellent stars of pop music”, says baroness Fion Thyssen-Bornemitsa.
In the 60th and 70's we both lived in the Alps and they were good friends.
Valentina - matchless owner assumes guests with the generosity and elegance.
“Us by all greatly it pleased to arrive in its Charles in Gshtaade”, explains the former wife “of Khayni” Thyssen, the close friend of the forgotten beauties like Marelly to Anelli or Yevgeny Niarkhos.
Valentina always preferred elegance to glory.
And in spite of this, it - star.
Valerie Matstsa, who presents Valentina
The Argentinean model of Valerie Matsts recalls charismatic fashion designer.
Once we send to reap to it home, this was after the showing of modes over the area of Spain in Rome, there are many years ago.
Among twenty those invited there were Sharon Stone and Dzhon Kennedi - youngest.
The style of Valentina was manifested in everything - in each component of his apartment, in its decoration, in the food, in the music.
“To each of the guests of Valentina it gave to feel itself to important and that loved”, recalls “the top model”, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the week of high mode in Paris.
“It never leaves from the mode, because its sketches - this the present works of art”, it concludes.
Parade of the genealogical
Life of Garavani - the history not of obsession, but loves with the complete reciprocity.
It loves people with a good training and high titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries of Somerset-khaus was converted into glamorous podium of sixty meters into the length, which proposes the change of the roles: visitor occupies the place of models and must march on podiumu, contemplating “spectators” from the dreams, which sparkle by masterpieces from Valentina, similar as the dress, which it selected by Jaqueline Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, suit, which used Monica Vitti in “the night”, or coat from the fur and skins, which belonged to empress the headlight of Diba.
In this public from the models blestayut such names, as Sibyl Lyuksemburgskaya, Gloria von Thurnu und taxis, Mette-maritas from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
ITR of Abaskal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients indicate that first Valentina - as the first love, “cannot be forgotten”.
I remember it wonderfully.
These were pants, jacket, “waistcoat” and jacket from the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972.
“This was the gift, which it to me made”, tells in the ITR of Abaskal, one of the Muzas of designer.
“I prefer to its rest for its femininity, for its great love for the women, because he emphasizes our beauty”, adds former duchess de Feria.
The colors, which he uses, greatly please me: in them much light and they “approach” its face.
Proportions are ideal.
Princess and legislatress of the modes of Patritsia della Dzhovampaola d " Arenberg also cannot forget for the first time, when she dressed in Valentina.
When I was adolescent and lived in Italy, I dreamed, that in me there will be the age and occasion in order to put on one of its evening toilets…
That hour at the end of the 90's finally arrived.
I purchased my first dress from Valentina in order to put on him to the holiday in the lock of my cousin, prince Eduard de Lin.
This was red dress, with the skirt with the frills, “corsage” into the fold and cut without the shoulder straps.
“This was the sleep, which became reality”, says the widow of Rodrigo d " Arenberga.
“Valentina is indifferent to the mode, his passion - this timeless”, explains this Italian aristokratka, which lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of d " Arenberg stores her holiday dresses from the fashion designer “by maximum caution… because dress - this not is not simple dress, this also the totality of the memories, which accompany him”.
“The king” of the mode
Great finale of exhibition into Somerset-khaus - wedding dress Marie-Shantal Miller for its wedding with Pavlosom from Greece in 1995.
Were required four months of work even 25 “girls” (as calls the fashion designer of his seamstresses) in order to prepare this detail from the silk of the color of ivory with the incrustation by pearls, twelve forms of different lace and by train into four and one-half of meter.
According to woman journalist Syuzi Menkes, to the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is to the hemlock of the high mode of the end of the 20th Century, “the return of clients from high society”.
Stupified many years “by the style of the life” of the elite, now Valentina itself is its best representative.
The cavalier of large cross (decoration of very high rank in Italy), cavalier of labor, commander of the order of art and literature, rewarded with the order of honorable legion, Garavani gathered as much honors, as any of the husbands of its clients.
“Always my attention attracted its refinement, its calmness, its accurate and irreproachable exterior view”, recalls d " Arenberg.
The last time I him saw month ago at solemn supper in the museum of Orsay.
It sat at the table with the countess of Jaqueline de Ribe, my large friend.
“It was irreproachable, time does not exist for it”.
If this speaks princess…
Heaviest profession in the world: miners the kava-Idzhena
For four Euros Indonesian miners risk by life and by health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of volcano along the steep stony paths
There are people, for which their work - hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them anta Vidzhayya, one of 400 miners, who earn to the life of the outputs of sulfur in the volcano kava-Idzhen, located to the east of Indonesian island Java.
Each day of antae gets down on the very bottom of the crater, where the sulfur dioxide, which is risen from the depths of the Earth, thickens with the contact with air.
After separating the enormous pieces of sulfur, whose total weight can reach 70 kg, it places them into two bamboo baskets, loads baskets on the arms and bears them upward along the precipitous stony road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height composes 2,386 meters, altogetheronly of 250 meters; however, to the emaciated loaders are required more than 40 minutes, in order to rise by tortoise step, with difficulty retaining equilibrium and carefully groping road in order not to stumble and not to fall from the break.
They know that one incorrect step can cost them life, as this happened of one tourist of France, which was torn away several years ago from the cliffs kava-Idzhena.
Miners kava-Idzhena earn 5 evrotsentov for each kilogram of sulfur, which they obtain
After proving to be above, they lay to themselves the road between the tourists, who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and, it got tired bearing heavy baskets, step three kilometers to the weights, which the mining company arranged scarcely higher, at the height of 1,850 meters.
The discussion deals with PT of Kandy Ngrimbi, enterprise, which exploits since 1960 this volcano and, it is better and not to say, its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 evrotsentov) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 evrotsentov) to petrochemical productions, indeed this mineral is extended in the daily life and is used for preparing of matches, fireworks, cosmetic, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
“Since standard is the carrying-over of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 Euros) for each to the mine passage”, explains to us anta, which usually carries out three daily carrying-overs.
It spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels itself broken; however, they make possible for it to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 Euros) toward the end of the day.
Although this seems by mizerom for this superhuman effort, this is triply more than that it would earn in the field.
“Daily pay of miners is very high on the local measures, where for the collection by coffee they pay 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euros) during the day and average monthly earnings it is equal to two million rupees (167 Euros)”, explains the loader, who earlier worked as mason in the tourist island of Bali.
There its wage composed 75,000 rupees (6.2 Euros) during the day and section was not such heavy, but antae returned with its family into Banyuvangi, town not far from the volcano, for the important reason, which in Indonesia is the same crushing as sulfur: “I was married the girl with Bali, where some induisty, and brought it in Java so that it would accept Islam”.
In anta asthma, it breathes with difficulty, constantly it coughs, and in it eyes because of the toxic gases water
In its 27 years of antae were conducted three years, risking by itself in the kava-Idzhene, whose sulfur already began to affect it in spite of the presence of mask and special glasses.
In it asthma, it breathes with difficulty, constantly it coughs, and in it eyes because of the toxic gases, which separate volcano, water.
This is the price, which it must pay for reaching of its dream.
“I will work already two years, because I want to open store or to study Spanish or French”, it promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and clever young person could be tourist guide, waiter or hall porter in the hotel, but instead of this he carries out the work of mule.
After dividing dirty wooden cabin with other porters, it arises each day at two P.M., because sulfur will not cease to emerge at night, when its characteristic yellow is converted in the blue and it blestit among the gloom.
Throwing call shadows, it gets down by antae into the crater, illuminating to itself road by the small lamp, connected to its helmet, which it itself purchased to its money.
The baskets with the gray on their arms from the bottom of the volcano drag about 400 porters
In spite of the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the output of sulfur for the savings of expenditures and it gives no equipment the porters, who work on their calculation and with such deprivations.
Actually, they do not obtain even part from 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euros) of the collection for photography, which, together with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euros), the guards of this preserve collect from the tourists, who come in order to photograph volcano and its person-mules.
“This work for the cattle, but not for the people”, declares Badrusin, the thickset porter of 42 years, who conducted on the kava-Idzhene three decades, since left college.
The capable of raising to 110 kilograms, it assures, which will suffer work “as much, as will be able”, because money for the education of their three children at the age from 18 to 10 years necessary to it.
I will not retire on pension, I will die here, because volcano - this entire my life
Although sulfur anneals throat and burns the eyes, when wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense columns of smoke, which emerge from the volcano, they are so hardy that none complains about its severe illnesses… their more serious, obviously, than customary problems with the respiration, arthroses, pain in the elbows and ulcer on the arms, which were deformed under the gravity of baskets.
Balancing basket on the spin, Unaynik now only can raise 50 kilograms in its 53 years.
Each day it and its comrades will carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the storage in Tamansari, covering distance into 18 kilometers along the narrow path among the brushwood.
“I will not retire on pension, I will die here, because volcano - this entire my life”, declares Unaynik, widely opening mouth, in which several teeth are not sufficient.
From its five children, the elder, 30 years, also works as the carrier of sulfur.
Time is passed, but misery immortalizes from generation to generation one of the heaviest occupations in the world: that how are occupied human mules kava-Idzhena.
Singapore searches for children in order to save the economy
Singapurtsy charge career, stress and prices of dwelling and education in the absence of children.
“To the population of Singapore necessarily grow”.
I husband patriot, you my of husband patriot, will carry out our civic duty and let us create life!
It can seem by improbable that these lines are the part of the advertisement of mint flat cakes; however, in spite of this - or possibly therefore - this video became Heath to YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are the part of rap, which uses local sayings like “give let us place bao (roll) into the stove” in order to laugh above the level of birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which made this video, BBH, leleet hope, which with the aid of the advertisement for them will succeed in drawing attention to this problem in the entertaining form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, he speaks that he wanted to use force of music so that the people would carry out “their national debt”.
This thing it is exclusive for the Internet; therefore for we had to make its merry and ridiculous.
This is major problem in the country.
We worse in the world on the reproduction to ourselves of the similar; therefore we felt that this is that theme, which we must affect.
We knew that the government attempted to make much, for example to carry out starting of perfumes with pheromones or to organize the parties of rapid acquaintances (blits-meetings).
Many of these ideas were, possibly, creative, but not necessarily they operated.
Therefore we did think, why to us not to make the most creative thing from the possible in order to solve this problem, to namely compose rap?
1,2 children
Who does not receive this so lightly, so this government of Singapore.
It spends 1,300 US dollars per year on the policy for the enthusiasm of citizens for the generation of a larger quantity of children.
State packet for the conjugal pairs and parents allows to 15,000 dollars to the child, prolongs vacations on pregnancy and childbirths and ensures tax breaks.
But all this has low effectiveness.
Singapore - this rich and highly technological state-city in southeastern Asia, also noted for the conservatism of its management and by its strict public control.
The level of birth rate in Singapore, according to its national control according to population, is located at present on the level of 1,2 children to the woman.
The last time it was below 2nd that known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why singapurtsy do not have a larger quantity of children?
Tan twist min, the director of the department of policy on the conjugal pairs and families for national control according to population, he indicates that reason to that “improved formation” and “the wider range of career opportunities”.
“This allowed people to have available the wider range of versions in the fact that vital purposes and priorities, besides wedding and creation of family”, it explains.
These changes in the social standards contribute to increase in the quantity of bachelors and to postponement of marriages and generation of children, as a result of which it was lowered the level of birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile the immigration policy, which is directed toward a sharp increase in the immigration for the opposition to the reduction of population, causes resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are the Web sites, where flourishes hardly hidden xenophobia in the attitude of many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese, whom they criticize for the maintenance of wages at the low level and unwillingness to be integrated.
An increase in the immigration is also considered as by one of reason for the fact that in the past year ruling party of Singapore obtained the worse result on the selections from the times of independence.
After selections there was the attempt to solve problem, with the aid of the quotas and more heavy taxes for the foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While a drop in the birth rate renders known influence on economic growth in the nation, tax revenues, expenditures for medicine and policy of immigration, an example of Singapore also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
Government makes efforts so that it would not be built the so many small dwelling.
For example, this beginning to influence in the sector of real estate.
Management on the urban development passed to the control of the number of small apartments, known as “shoe box”, which can be built in the specific city districts.
These apartments are very well sold by the area of 46 square meters.
Nevertheless, there is the opinion that they can contribute to an unmarried way of life and deprive of the stimulus of the housebuilders, who want to build large family dwelling.
But LIM of Yu of Sun, the Director-General of house-building firm EL Developers, says that them “shoe boxes” they are sold considerably more rapidly than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in that sense that such apartments buy up by several days, even weeks, it is more rapid than the apartment of larger size.
Our received payments increase as a result of this.
Nevertheless, it recognizes that the new standards give more clear orientators for the housebuilders, to which earlier were placed the obstacles, if they wanted to propose too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstressed
Singapore - this is city-state.
Although these new rules can be step in the direction of an increase in the national birth rate, after conversation with singapurtsami, which work in the financial block of center, it seems that they will not have special effect.
“People are very overstressed, dwelling expensive, just as formation, and because of this many people this put aside”, says young controller.
Other people can have children.
“But for me it is important to have available its own money and time”, says another young person of 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and prices of the dwelling and formation as the reasons, which prevent them from starting children.
So that, however government tried to impel its citizens to the generation of children, in the fact that child-bearing, last word remains after singapurtsami.
Personal in offline - personal in the online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish language, the discussion deals with the property of quotient or “to the sphere of personal life, which they have the right to protect from any interference”.
What is personal for the minor younger than 16 years?
How it does use this determination in its daily life and in the social networks?
Does understand he the dangers, by which it does undergo with the consideration in the Internet of the situations, with which it would not for sure share out of the Internet?
elPeriódico took interview in five children from ten to 15 years, frequent users of network.
In four cases they associated term with “something very my”, in the personal plane, and “by password and by user name”, when was applied it to the social networks.
“My very big secrets I did not load into the post”, says ten-year Jorge, when attempts to explain the value of personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail Windows of Live Messenger, where in it already two years are accounts.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the entire world”, it asserts.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures from the games.
Also I am entertained with my acquaintances.
“I did not share with the photograph, which not my, or someone, who behaves foolishly”, he says.
Boy realizes, which is bad to publish the indecent photographs of the exposed people, crimes or to write insulting or furious commentaries.
Jorge assures, which knows 35 friends, whom in its FB, and nine its folloverov into Twitter.
Majorities of them relatives.
Mother in the course, in it is a password to one of the accounts.
I brought Twitter in order to express itself and to write interesting tweets.
“I do not know, they do answer me, I them only load”, he is added.
“Social networks - entertainment, I can talk with the distant relatives or with my friends po--rapid”, he indicates.
Without a moment's hesitation, it answers, that never would accept the request from the unknown person.
It would not begin to consider someone, who would recommend it to stranger.
The case of 14-year Jose differs.
In this adolescent is the open accounts to Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter it recognizes that do not know 20 people, friends the added in his list.
“This does not frighten me, because of being something general, music, for example”, he indicates.
According to the boy, no one to it was rubbed into the confidence and did not request its domestic address or number of telephone.
“If to me they will begin to press or to require, simply I will remove them from my account”, it recognizes.
Jose became the follower of Ask after the reading of recommendation into Twitter.
To boy is not alien the experience of the fact that is today known as kibermobbing.
One my familiar friend they blackmailed in the social network.
They threatened it and extorted money.
“It so did not learn, who this was”, he certifies.
The victim according to Jose, did not remove account.
“Was only included privacy”.
Then it explains the sequence of steps for tuning of account by safe means.
In contrast to Jorge, this boy would load the photographs of acquaintances in the inconvenient or awkward situations.
Yes, I would make this, if man does not please me or if me this he wants.
“Although I know that this kibermobbing”, he confirms.
The key issues
Marelos Porras, the instructor of English and specialist for the formation and instruction, considers that in order to ship children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand, that the purpose of social networks - to inform.
“The Internet appeared as means for retrieval for information, but with the advent of these sites changed rules of the game”, it notes.
Porras indicates that the academician Mark Prenskya, the master of pedagogy from the Yale university and the author of labor digital aborigines and immigrants, invented these terms for explaining this phenomenon.
Digital aborigines these are they, the children and young people, who were born in the epoch of technologies.
“We digital immigrants, which it is necessary to teach them, while we still themselves learn”, she says.
It explains, that this theme is complex, “because we them we request to have the specific criterion of the fact that is possible or cannot be extended, published or spoken, at the age, when maturity is not sufficient for this”.
“Also that they would be selective, while most important of all for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences”, it adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective method to show what is privacy is to children and to adolescents, to present the question, which force them to reflect.
“To tell in them so that they would not make this, is useless”, it adds.
Then Porras transfers some versions: there are the things, which you would not describe to stranger, so why you this do make in the Internet?
Or, to you it would be pleased, if they would publish photograph you like that did publish you about your friend?
Do know you that others they do publish about you?
When you do sign photographs from the parties, do request you permission in other people, in order to note them?
And one more, by all whether it is necessary to know that you do make at each moment?
One additional point - this to give to them to understand that they must behave online, just as makes this off-line.
Rules are the same.
“Out of the Internet man behaves with the respect, responsibility and other principles, so must be in the social networks”, it asserts.
Vigilance

Understanding each of the points, they have good bases for the conversations with the children about the prerequisites of the discovery of Internet account.
“For example, age and that which is permitted to extend or to publish”, he says.
Accordingly Gaurdiya, key issue - to remind children of lesson “do not speak to strangers”.
Summit UNASUR concludes without the promulgation of the Limskoy declaration
VI the presidential summit of the union of South American nations (UNASUR) was completed today in Peru without the promulgation of the Limskoy declaration, declared earlier and theoretically signed family by required participants.
Efe repeatedly attempted to obtain access to the document, signed on VI the current the meeting of Heads of states and governments UNASUR; however, sources from office and president's administration the main page that they will transmit him after closing, but then they confirmed that at the specific moment it will be published on the Web site of Peruvian government.
To questions about the text, they indicated that contained was stated by the President of Peru, Olyanta Umala, during the brief statements for the press.
The access of journalists to the information about the summit was always limited.
During the day was only transmitted, in the hall for the press, video of presidential assembly without the sound with the communication “closed meeting, sound was forbidden”.
A little information, which circulated among the reporters, was transmitted by the press-secretaries of some governments UNASUR, which attended meeting; however, not Peruvian.
The only document, disseminated during the day, was the list of the participating Presidents, which caused dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media outlets, which requested more than information.
Subsequently the president's administration of Peru sent electronic communication media outlets with “final declaration” of summit; however, the discussion deals with the statement of Umaly, but not about the official document, by which was completed the summit.
In the past October Peru assumed the III summit of South American and Arab countries (ASPA), and that time, in spite of the fact that this it persistently required press, was not also disseminated the so-called Limskaya declaration, which they previously declared.
On the official Web site ASPA it is possible to verify that the document was published on past Tuesday.
Peruvian authorities tried at both international meetings so that the transmission systems for all journalists would be provided for; however, they maximally limited obtaining information.
Summit was also completed by the joint solution of Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague court, which will regulate the territorial dispute between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala, and by Chile, Sebastian Piner, were gathered at the regional encounter and ratified, that they will observe the resolution of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in the Hague the hearing of statements of both sides, within the framework of the charge, which Lima advanced against Santiago.
“We will observe and fulfill the solution, which will elucidate the differences, which we at present present into this International Court of Justice”, said Umala, next to its Chilean colleague.
“Chile it was, there is and will be the country, which respects international law, the peaceful permission of differences, pacts and international tribunals”, added Pinera, and it greeted pozhatiem of hand Umalu against the background of the flags of these two countries.
Confirmation by both Presidents of the fact that they will obey the International Court of Justice, occurred immediately after Columbia it protested on this week the Bogotskiy pact, according to which it recognized the subordination to the verdicts of this International Court of Justice after the solution about the sea boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered as erroneous.
Summit took place in the absence the Presidents of Brazil, Dilmy Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Eva Moralesa; and Argentina, Kristiny Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR was stopped since 2011 after the impeachment of its former President of Fernando by the Luga, did not participate in the encounter.
The assuming President, Olyanta Umala, were critical for the discovery of the considerations of the morning and for closing of summit, only it is later than noon on the Limskomu time.
The Head of State read the concluding document, in which it reported that were accepted 16 agreements and were affirmed the directions of action on 31 projects among the South American countries, the sum of the assumed investments was 17 billion of dollars.
Among the agreements accepted it mentioned that the countries UNASUR will undertake “major steps toward the purpose of South American citizenship, for which we is expansible agreement about the place of residence”.
It reported that are undertaken the actions for the improvement “collaboration in the fight against the uncertainty of citizens and against the organized transnational criminality, action for an increase in the accessibility of medicines, inexpensive Internet access in all corners of South America and taking into the attention by the joint and effective means of the risks of natural catastrophes”.
Since Europe in the crisis, “the economic association (Latin America) must not have triumfatorskoy basis, but must serve for expanding our production basis and foresee better future for our cities”, added Umala.
“We decided to give privilege to group of 31 sign projects, which will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, in particular in the rural and border zones… uniting our countries and forming new economic diagrams”, said the Peruvian President in the read communication.
It mentioned among these projects that five relate to Peru, and they are limited by transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at the large connection with Ecuador; however, it did not grant more than details.
Also concluding document affected political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve her repeated connection to the union of South American nations”, from which at present it is excluded.
The need for Latin America being remained region of the prosperity and world, would be united, and it had good relations between the neighbors, it was another theme, emphasized on the summit.
In this sense the President of Columbia, Juan Manuel Santos, he said before approaching the participation in the regional encounter, which hopes to meet with its colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortegoy, on Saturday in Mexico City for conducting the negotiations in the valid form about the sea dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice, disputed by Bogota.
“Day after tomorrow (on Saturday), possibly, I will meet with President Daniel Ortegoy”, said Santos.
“We will reexamine all these ways, they not mutually which prevent pact with Nicaragua it will, including require consideration with Nicaragua”, he emphasized.
“With the President of Ortega, I hope, I can say to it that we will manage this maximally possible civilized and valid means”, added Santos.

Argentina, Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guiana, Surinam and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation by the latter from the countries is stopped.
Peru has temporary presidency in the regional block.
“South America must learn in Europe in a question of the integration of citizenship”: Raphael Korre
The President of Ecuador, Raphael Korre, confirmed today that the creation of general citizenship is the purpose, in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn in Europe”.
Korrea, which participated in VI the presidential summit of the union of South American nations (UNASUR), conducted in Lima, it stated to the government television of Peru that the Europeans " killed each other during the Second World War”, also, in other collisions, “however, now they practically one fatherland”.
It protected the project of the establishment of South American citizenship, which approve the country-participants UNASUR, in this context.
“It is necessary to attain the free displacement of citizens and workers over any South American country, as this already occurs with the terms of Andskogo association, but, until now there are the reaction sectors, which want to return us to the past”, it warned.
The Ecuadorian President appeared himself, furthermore, by the supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAG) under the prerequisite of reduction in the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into the attention of those, who signed the pact of san jose about human rights.
Those, who read lecture, never take to themselves any obligations, but we, yuzhnoamerikantsy we, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is not explained, that the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is financed by the United States”, he stated, hinting at the political refuge, given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange.
Korrea certified, that it does not feel sorry about this solution, because with it did not betray its principles, but were observed its “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
It added that in their time “there were the specific suspicions of the fact that Assange will be extradited into third country and will not be observed process”.
It criticized severely, furthermore, Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive to its territory for the examination concerning the assumed crime on the sexual soil, while “Swedish legislation itself considers possible to carry out it by means of the video conference, which it would be possible to make from the embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Korrea confirmed that there is a risk of worsening in physical and mental health of Assange.
“I did not speak with it from those times, as he arrived in our embassy, but ambassador to me it reported that it has the small pulmonary problem, nothing serious”, said Ecuadorian the Head of State.
That actually be, so this the danger of worsening in its physical and mental health because of the imprisonment in the small space without the opportunity to make exercises in air.
“This influences the health of any person”, it added.
Korrea indicated that the solution of the problem of the refuge, given to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of the assignment to the guarantee of inviolability, which will allow it to go into Ecuador, is located in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs and he emphasized that there were the talks in London about the search for the solution of the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not conduct the negotiations about human rights, this word we in this case is not utilized, but there were constant discussions.
“The solution of this problem is located in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs, because the attorney Assange, Baltasar Garson, conducts a number of processes in different European instances”, he mentioned.
And expressed the opinion that “if Great Britain tomorrow grants the guarantee of inviolability, this will end”.
And if Sweden, as for it wonderfully is allowed its legislation and as it already made in other cases, will interrogate Senor Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or will interrogate him on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Korrea used the case in order to appear itself as the defender of press freedom he emphasized that does not suffer “the mediocrities, unconscientiousness and lie, which distort freedom of expression”.
“Main enemies of press freedom this not damaged villain-politicians, but poor journalists, who support profit, blackmail and extortion”, he said.
In this aspect it remained contented, that already neither these journalists, “nor bankers nor bourgeois country-predominant powers rule in Ecuador”, and it added that, being re-elected, “will be deepened the revolution for continuing the development in the right direction”.
Korrea also supported the solution to preserve the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least to the following selections, arguing this fact that the organization “must be solid and not suffer opportunism and support of revolutions under the mask of legality”, because in actuality “this destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuadorian President considered, furthermore, “completely substantiated” the desire of his Columbian of colleague Juan Manuel Santos to conduct now the negotiations with Nicaragua about the sea boundaries between two countries after the resolution of the International Court of Justice of justice of the Hague, which proved to be in favor Nicaraguan sea sovereignty.
This solution is not observed at the given moment.
This is the problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together in order to overcome them and to continue to advance.
Also it expressed hope for a good completion of the dispute about the sea boundaries, which Veduta in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed, which “is correct for Latin America to turn into the international instances, if two countries obyazuyutsya to make the decision, such as heavy it not was”.
Concerning the opportunity to come out as the candidate on the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador in order to be a candidate for the third period contract, it indicated that is examined this opportunity “with large optimism and happiness, although sometimes this is sufficiently heavy”.
Korrea certified, which if loses on the selections in February 2013, then it will leave from public life.
In the personal plan I never was interested in the authority, but in such wrong situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be corrected only from the side of political power.
“My political movement considered, that precisely I guaranteed this likely victory, so that is necessary to recognize this responsibility”, he said.
In the case of victory this would become my last period in the place of president, and then we leave from public life.
If we lose, the same.
“This solution”, confirmed it.
Korrea also mentioned the new course of the treatment of the Venezuelan President of Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I recently spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who said to me that it left for the treatment, which was already planned, routine, and which is expected that it will pass campaign in order to return in Cuba.
“This does not indicate the aggravation of the status of the health of President Chavez”, it explained.
The head of Ecuadorian state participated today in Lima in VI the summit of the Heads of states and governments of the union of South American nations (UNASUR), which was completed with the calls to the larger regional integration for maintaining of progress, equality and safety.
Mortality from AIDS today - the result of late diagnostics
Fabrizio was 21 year, when they declared to it, that its analysis to AIDS yielded positive results.
“Me as if they stunned”, it recalls that difficult, in spite of entire time of doctor, moment.
Youth hid this from his family.
After deciding to manage the disease independently, it wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And its efforts justified - it already noted its 43-y birthday.
Fabrizio - one of “oldest” patients of the HIV-department of the hospital of Hospital Civil de of Guadalajara (HCG), where it fell in 1994, after overcoming numerous obstacles.
It lives with the diagnosis “the virus of the immunodeficiency of man” (HIV) already 22 years. At the beginning of the 90's into this it would be complicated to believe - too little then there existed the versions of treatment, they knew too a few about the disease, too preconceived they related to the patients.
Thus, even director of the clinic of the Mexican institute of social protection did not want to be requested with it, “because he has cut”.
In those times to in other words, have AIDS was sentence.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and to make this, without worsening quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing about their illness, until now, many people come, when virus already caused loss, it " wasted” their immune system and they suffer from the opportunistic infections.
31 year after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least after the first declared cases, “great achievement at the given moment is the fact that the survival of the patient, who begins treatment in proper time, and survival of general population exactly are identical”, indicated the head of HIV-department HCG, to Khayme Andrade Vilyanueva, after referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektsionist expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Vilyanueva explained, that since 2008 the scientists came to the conclusion that AIDS is not sentence; however, duration and quality of life they depend on the degree of the defeat of the immune system, available in patients with the beginning of diagnostics, from best expected by lifetime in those, who it does not use the narcotics: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and of up to 50 years, when it communicates about 500 CD4.
Simply stated, above-mentioned means that the one who obtains the diagnosis positive 25 years of HIV-positive at the age, according to these terms, “supporting control, will be able to live without the problems up to 75 years”, it explained.
In order to estimate this progress, one should recall that the lifetime of Mexicans on the average is today 76 years.
Although the mortality was considerably reduced in recent years, in the case of Mexico, of numbers of people, which die from AIDS, was reduced from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual report YUNEYDS), also is also true that they died from the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and are already registered 187 deaths by May of this year; nevertheless, it is asserted that there is general access to the anti-retrovirus preparations since 2005.
- Why, until now, there are lethal outcomes?
- It personally me seems that problem not in the access to the treatment.
So I this visualize, so are matters in our hospital.
As the minimum the last 12 years we did not have deficiency in the drugs, problem in the fact that the patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected state, i.e., at the last stages of disease.
It cited crushing data: “Nine of ten patients come, when they already have any opportunistic infection; what must be done in order to have a larger effect on general mortality, so this to carry out diagnostics at the earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to allow tests for the detection on a mass scale, for all people, which this will request”.
In their proposal are agreed in the opinion the specialists and officials of the Council of State for the preventive maintenance of AIDS to Jalisco (COESIDA), and also patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned for the checking into the particular laboratory, prompted only by the fact that this made its friend and, in spite of his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even he suffered Kaposi's sarcoma, cancerous tumor, which is one of the extended complications.
Everything changes, when you know that in you AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and nothing they want to know.
“Once nevertheless I will die, better I will nadiratsya three times a week”, they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I feed well, I make exercises, I assume medicines.
Today, its parents only know that it endured cancer.
I live normal life as any another.
“I work, i have it is many occupations, I travel, I conduct active sexual life, but with the mutual responsibility, I worry about itself and about other person”, transferred Fabrizio, who agreed to share with his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to spodvignut by its statement of those, who now, in the context of the world day of fight with AIDS, experience fear.
Let it be they verified, if there was the risk of infection, albeit as soon as possible they learn, they are they HIV-positive, then better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let it be they learn, that they can live as any other person, being by critical.
Its this communication sums up the theme of fight against AIDS in this 2012.
Condoms after the counter
The precipices between the programs in the region of public health and simple citizen are great, assumes Ricardo Salazar, the journalist from Guadalajara, who studied the problem, connected HIV.
And largest this is preventive maintenance.
In the places, dedicated to this task, “in reality increased the propagation of condoms, earlier to us gave one or two, now to us give packets on hundred, and this very well, but it occurs that there are those, who, until now do not now have a access to the condom”, he, said.
The adolescents are located among most vulnerable to the new infections.
“Why they to you?” this is the popular question, with the malice and censure, from the side of social workers, school consultants, the colleagues of drugstores and workers of public health, which do not want to hear the adolescents, propagandist certified.
I propose to change this ineffective distribution; so that the condoms would be not only after the counters and so that hundreds of them it would be located in the automatic weapons in the public toilets in the places, which it frequently attends young people.
This is not the encouragement of disorderliness.
The discussion does not deal with the payment of beer and motelya, governor Emilio Gonzalez answered, when they asked it, the distribution of condoms with its management was possible.
“This is not sexuality, it is best to make condoms accessible for those, who already practice sexual activity”, he noted.
Key given in Jalisco
Are registered 13.435 total cases (12.158 AIDS even 1.317 HIV).
State occupies the 4th place in the national rating on the new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92% of infections relate to the sexual way, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal way.
_on estimation, 50,000 thousand people can live with HIV, since on one register case be from 4 to 5 man, which about this not know.
Taking into account ratification by the court of appeals of the United States of the solution, which annuls the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitros, achieved by means of the competitive production in Mexico, scenario establishes fateful precedent for any national company with the branches in the neighboring country, which has problems with the solvency.
It seems that the procedures in the support of the survival of the firms, which are permitted by Mexican laws, are not real in the country of strips and stars, in the contradiction with the international agreements.
In the practical sphere, the approval of the solution, carried out on June 15 by the judge of Kharlin Hale in the court of bankruptcies of the northern region of Texas, leaves defenseless the Mexican firms before face of the opportunity of the imposition of arrest on their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However, decision opens doors to the chief producer of glass in Mexico for the rotation into the Supreme Court of the United States, leading into the proof three nonconformities.
As the entry, while the judge of the matter notes that the creditors must be regulated by the code of the USA about bankruptcy, the court of appeals of the fifth region, located in New Orleans, he indicates that the basic trial concerns the competitive production, examined in Mexico.
The first point implies the annulment of international judicial collaboration in the cases of the insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile.
Actually, the standard law of the United Nations for the unification of the right of international trade for this purpose was created, determining as the arbiter the American institute of right.
Verdict it in the second place, establishes that without the interfirm voting, acknowledged in the critical mass of the competitive production of debts, which had before the maternal company branches of Vitros, it would not be achieved the majority, necessary for asserting the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity recognize Mexican laws.
Fakticheskya, Vitro was not the first case, when this diagram starts.
There are half dozens of the examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, the federal institute of competitive productions guaranteed whose interfirm debts.
Is also true that reading the voices of branches, one way or another the creditors of Vitros, who fought with it in the vessels of the United States, namely funds “carrion vultures” like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach majority.
Voting would be 45 percent against 37.
These given court of appeals descends.
From the other side, it charges Vitros with the complex situation, which that encountered since 2008, touched upon by the serious economic crisis, which overtake the United States, delivering impacts in the country.
Thus far the firm of family Gonzalez garden will produce the appeal of the solution into court of appeals himself so that the voting would reach before his plenum, i.e., five judges, in view of the fact that they voted only three.
In the case of failure the petition about the certification, which will require the revision of process from the side of the court of the higher authority, in this case of the Supreme Court of the United States, will be produced.
Is worse anything the fact that the court deflected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (“the friend of court”), in which was described the process, which follows Vitro within the framework of the law about the competitive productions, signaling about the fact that it frees itself from the observance of the agreements, signed by both countries in order to connect it with the article 15 laws of the USA about bankruptcy.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country obeyed the principles of the commission of the United Nations on international trade, i.e., to the rules, established for the cases of the intergovermental insolvency, which guarantee equality of rights for the debtors and creditors.
Cannon from two boards: they beat in Vitros and beat into the country.
Total balance
Taking into account those postponed by several months of the complaints, placed on the table by the trade unions of Mexicana de of Aviación against the former company owner, Gaston Askarrag to Andrade, who is charged with knavish control, the trade-union association of the pilots of airmen already revealed bottle neck.
The instance, headed Carlos Dias Chavez by Morino, recently presented the requirement of criminal case against the national commission for banks and securities, which is charged with the obstruction to justice.
According to this, regulatory organ systematically rejected to allow reports into the General Procurator's office of republic concerning the operation, performed by owner for the extraction from the confidence fund for F/589 of the bank IXE of 198 million pesos, on behalf Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed toward the purchase of the actions of the professional controlling company of hotels.
As you know, Askarraga to Andrade is the basic shareholder of the network of the hotels of Posadas.
Surround Dragon Mart
After being gathered on the output on the forum at the Caribbean university, the group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of general civil society approved the creation of broad front for the opposition to the discovery of the Chinese of Dragon Mart in Kankune.
We speak how you know, about the gigantic center of sale and propagation into Mexico, central America and countries of the Caribbean Basin of production of the isolated country, with the habitable zone near for the colleagues of 150 companies.
Previously Canacintra was possible to combine the governors of southeastern zone for the opposition to the monumental forces, which levelled with the earth the part of the guarded territories and advance the serious threats against the industry.
Death ACTA
Concerning the deflected by government requirement of the senate to explain, with what conditions and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the trade agreement on the fight with the infringement, known as abbreviation on English ACTA, according to the Mexican institute of industrial property, this matter already passed into the archive.
As you know, action was executed, in spite of the fact that senate itself disqualified the opportunity to examine it as disrupting freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex in the long-term outlook
Attempting to extinguish the long-term debts, without influencing short term, the housebuilder of the dwelling of Homex places on the market stock exchange certificates to 500 million pesos.
Release appears first of four identical, with the proposal of the payment of the percentages of every 28 days.
Competival comes into being itself
Formed by enterprises NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, by the leaders into the region of information texnology, consortium with the commercial designation of Competival recently appeared to the light, the market for the services of the clusters of software in central and South America will be its purpose.
Investments into this region exceed 1.5 billion of dollars.
Hector “Khetin” of Reyes: “Basketball was my life”
Inveterate basketball traveller Hector “Khetin” of Reyes was more than 60 years connected with this sport and, because of it, the entire world travelled over.
Almost no one in Puerto Rico stores in the memory so many basketball histories as Hector “Khetin” of Reyes.
And indeed, before hemorrhage into the brain it riveted it to the invalid carriage in 2008, Reyes was submerged in the sport during more than 60 years, as the player of small categories, the player of the highest basketball league, authorized and the leader of BSN with the cowboys of Bayamona and President of the federation of basketball.
“I carried out many roles in the basketball during my life, including somewhat simultaneously, sporadically I was the President BSN, Director-General of national team and President of federation in the 90's”, recalls Reyes during the visit of Primera Hora to it home into Bayamon, where it lives from Isabel, by its accurate by wife for the elongation it is more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life”.
Reyes it does not exaggerate, making this assertion.
The walls of its houses, almost everyone decorated with photographs and memorable things, assembled for its long journey, testifies about this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the naibolshimi emotions it stores those, which remember its way through the cowboys, beginning from the middle of the 50th years as the player until 1982, when 15 years of his appearance in the role of with-agent or agent of contract were carried out.
“These were my best years, by which I delighted in most of all, because had an opportunity to be the part of eight championships of cowboys since 1967, as the agent, with-agent or leader.
There were many years of happiness of the, including five championships, which passed with 1971 until 1975.
But then I was requested with one in 1981, per year debuts of Jerome Minsi in BSN.
From that moment henceforth to lead it began “Kuko” of Ortis, which was great administrator”, was indicated Reyes.
I remember that Gina the Bart, which was sent here and it was at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), it said to me: “I for you have a very strong player, with increase in 6 ' 7”.
“You want?”
And this was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico.
The Bart then it recommended the sniper of Raymonda of Gauss, who obtained citizenship and became one of our best bombardiers.
I remember that he said that if Minsi brought the championship to Bayamonu, Gauss would help to conquer one more.
By the championship of cowboys with Gauss I took pleasure, but already at a distance, because he was by 1988 already registered by the chief of federation.
By that time I preferred to delight in by his achievements and achievements of Minsi in the national composite.
I remember, as we won the first time in the USA during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world championship of 1990, on which we obtained the fourth place and this it had to be bronze, if not that Canadian judge, who forced us to re-play final game, said Reyes.
That command from the world championship of 1990 - this the best composite, such as you did sometimes see?
It among the good, just as that won in Dream Team on the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my dear was that from the Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the team of the USA, which was sufficiently similar to that, which won bronze on the world championship.
In that command not only again played Minsi, Gaussa, Ramon Rivasa, Fico of Lopez and “Pikulina” (Ortisa), but also young (Javier) “Tonito” column and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quixote” of Morales, which could not participate in 90 because of the injury of elbow.
The command, which was, possibly, not best in the plan of personnel, but brought to us gold medal and great happiness, was the command of the Olympic qualification tournament of 1995 in Neukene, Argentina.
With the role players like “Kanito” of Nevesa, Pablo Alise and young Rolando Khurruitnera of instead of players, temporarily removed for the disorder in the Pan-American championship of Mar-del-Plata, we won gold in spite of all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubts, this was Pikulin Ortis.
Its indices at the international tournaments impress.
No one in Puerto Rico prevailed at this level in the manner that this made Pikulin.
And this without taking into account its career in different leagues, in which it played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican by leader?
This is a very complex question.
We have the very good young animals, that includes of Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raymonda to Dalmau, Armandito Torresa.
From the young, me greatly pleases the work of Leo Arilly.
What you do count as your main reaching in the federation?
Participation in most glorious epoch of the national composite between 1988 and 1995, and which at the beginning of the 90's in BSN was to 17 commands in the season.
What to you did remain to make?
There were the things, which I wanted to realize, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example so that the boys from Ponse would play only in their region and only against the commands from other parts of the island in the national play off.
Now children travel and they play too much, and this is superfluous.
At least, I see fruits of required certification and course for the controlling, officials and judges.
This reaches pleasure to me.
What you do now make?
Most of all I listen to music, look musical video of my epoch at YouTube, I delight in by my grandsons and rarely I walk to the basketball matches.
And I, of course, delight in by the society of my husbands, Icabel, which was always with me.
Died actor Larry Khegmen

Khegmen, which returned in this year as J.R in the new season “of Dallas”, died on Friday in the evening because of the complications, caused by cancer, according to the statement of family, given for The Associated Press by the company of Warner Bros., by the studio of the production “of Dallas”.
“Larry again returned to his dear home town Dallas, again playing the sign role, which most of all it pleased”, said its family.
The family of Larry and very close friends were with it in Dallas at the fair in the honor of the day of gratitude.
Linda Gray, that played role his husbands in the original series and in the sequel, was located next to Khegmenom, when it died in the hospital of Dallas, said its representative Jeffery Leyn.
It brought happiness to all, who knew it.
It was creative, generous, merry, affectionate and talented, and I will greatly be bored on it.
“It was original personality and lived complete life”, it confirmed Gray in the statement.
In Khegmena was diagnosed cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and it recognized that saws for many years.
In it they in 1995 revealed malignant tumor in the liver and it withstood transplantation.
Long before “Dallas”, Khegmen acquired the reputation on the television because of considerable type role in the light comedy “I Dream of Jeannie”, which was being transmitted by channel NBC from 1965 until 1970.
In it played the captain of Tony Nelson, astronaut, whose life changes, when it meets the attractive girl-dzhinna, whom Barbara Eden, plays, and he begins to live with it under one roof.
Also it was the main character of two comedies, which rarely appeared in ether, “The Good Life” (NBC, 1971-72) and “Here We Go of Again” (ABC, 1973).
Its work in cinema included the roles, well accepted by criticisms, into “The Group”, “Harry and Tonto” and “Primary Colors”.
But precisely its workshop interpretation of charmingly disgusting J.R gave Khegmena to the top of glory.
The dramatic series of channel CBS about the clan of Ewings and other characters in his environment went in ether from April 1978 to May 1991.
Advertising slogan “who did shoot in J.R.? ”, planned for creating the sensation around the episode, complete of emotions, in which the character of Khegmena only they do not kill, gave birth to international considerations and millions of dollars, by which they risked in the bookmaking offices.
Also this helped to draw record audience at that time to the series.
When was daN the answer in the episode dated November 1980, on the average of 41 million viewers they looked it and converted “Dallas” the secondly according to the number it was review entertaining program in the history, after the finale “of MASH” in 1983, which drew 50 million spectators.
This was sister-in-law J.R., Kristin (in execution Mary Krosbi), who shot at it.
J.R. it prevented it and then it threatened with it, which will accuse it of prostitution, if it is not removed from the city, but also others also had reasons to attack it.
Khegmen played Ewing as insatiable corrupt individual with the charismatic smile: dishonest owner and the incorrect husband, who wanted to its husband alcoholic, by Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed for the treatment.
“I know that must be on the sepulchral plate J.R”; - said Khegmen in 1988.
Must be said: “Here rests honest citizen J.R. Ewing”.
This is the only transaction, which it lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, also the heroine of original series, recalled on Friday Khegmena as someone “enormous both on and out of the screen”.
It is not forgotten and irreplaceable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, to whom it had luck to know and to love him.
Ten episodes of the new release “of Dallas” were shown several months ago with the great success on the channel TNT.
The record of five episodes of the second season was already finished and the sixth was in the production, reported channel.
Warner or TNT did not thus far make statement, that will be with the series after the withdrawal of Khegmena.

It asked happinesses on the theatrical scenes of New York at the beginning 1950-X of years, and then served in VVS of England from 1952 until 1956.
Being located there, it was introduced to the young Swedish artist May Akselsson and was married it.

The course, which investigates “the end of the world”, begins
Each week students investigate the apocalyptical phenomena, such as nuclear war, by zombie, viruses and bacterium and global warming.
In this semester, when the professor of religion Stewart charm decided to read course about the end of the world, he knew that he had available the irresistable bait: the end “long reverse counting” of the calendar of the Mayas, on December 21, for which were grasped many people as for the proof of the fact that the end of the world approaches.
But charm of concept it did not have, which it expected into the near the pair of the months: the catastrophic hurricane of Sendi, the financial crisis, which some call “dolgoarmageddonom”, and the growing conflict, where they will pull Israel, place, where the Christian theorists of the end of the times assume that the apocalypse will begin.
“I did not realize, that this there will be the most apocalyptical semester of all”, it said charm on this week to the university students of Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey).
If we analyze that which occurs in the world at present, as if remained only 30 days, this was actually good period.
And you remember that poor is good for those, in whom apocalyptical viewpoint.
And he is the only professor, who proposes courses on the theme “of the end of the world” in this semester, theoretically last in the history.
At the Templskiy university the associate professor Barry Vaker reads the course “of the mass media, culture and the end of the world”.
Each week students investigate the apocalyptical themes, such as nuclear war, by zombie, viruses and bacterium, and global warming.
“We analyze, why these ideas in the course of time are extended”, he said, and the method, to which the hypothetical scenarios, which cause specific behavior of man, propose.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it can break out war.
In this month the students analyzed films on the apocalyptical themes and they studied, as they are correlated with examples from the real life.
“I attempted to describe to students about that which is possible, probably, it is plausible and it is impossible”, said Vaker.
In the main campus of the university of the state of Pennsylvania the professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara to Solari, the associate professor of the history of art and anthropology, were combined in order to read the course, which is called simply “the end of the world”.
“We do not add “2012” in order to always have the capability to read course again, if the end of the world will not begin”, said Restall.
In spite of “unavoidable destruction”, the students must learn, prepare projects and pass total examinations.
In Penn State total examination will start on the eve of apocalypse that it does not leave to the students of another selection, except as to work “to that night itself, into which supposedly will begin the end of the world”, said Restall.
Courses proved to be sufficiently popular.
“Places ended in two hours”, spoke Restall about its course for the students with the high average mark, to which were written down 35 students.
We obtained communications on the electronic mail during many weeks before beginning semester from the people, which asked, there are whether other places.
Students, in turn, certify, that this course is one of the most interesting.
“Me it pleases to observe, that make people, in order to comfort themselves”, said Bridzhid Robinson, 23-year student of the department of religion and sociology from Khaddonfilda, New Jersey, into Rutgers-Kamden.
And the apocalyptical viewpoint, secular or religious, this is a only question of comfort or its absence.
Will Vekes, the 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and sister's matter, said that he looked all apocalyptical films.
“I never heard about the course, which would teach this”, it noted.
It pleases me.
But none of the interrogated students - speaking already about the professor - did not say that it believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project affected the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain kind we it discredited”, said Dzhuli Zeglen, the 21--year student of last course at the Templskiy university from West-Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; this is simply key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But it noted that there is a apocalyptical concern in the Western culture, which counts several centuries, where the people react to the changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people do not think about this”, he said.
Predominantly in English-speaking peace.
By Joseph Dogerti, the professor of the religion of university Lasalle, who teaches courses on the Philippines in this year, rapidly answered a question about that, he does know about any course about “the end of the world” there.
“The Philippines do not assume participation at the end of the light”, it wrote, hinting at the order of the higher authority.
We have pardon from the Pope.
Restall focused attention, which for the duration of long time told about many days of last court, and he said that if nothing it occurs on December 21, “people immediately they will begin to think about the following date” or to philosophize, that on December 21 it is the beginning of the seven-year period, after a lapse of which peace will end.
Students and instructors carelessly relate to this date.
Some said that they are going to go to the parties “of the end of the world”.
“It can be, I will ring someone of the friends in order to together laugh”, commented on Samir Ford, the 20-year student of the department of connection.
